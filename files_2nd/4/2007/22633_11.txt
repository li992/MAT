Reports and Financial Statements Report on Directors Remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and meets the relevant requirements of the revised Combined Code.
It is divided into the following principal sections: The Remuneration Committee.
The Companys policies on the remuneration of directors.
Current remuneration arrangements and financial summary of directors remuneration and share options.
The information contained in section 3 of this report has been audited.
This report will be submitted for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
1 Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the policy and framework of executive remuneration.
The policies concerning the remuneration of executive directors and their application are approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee also reviews the remuneration of senior managers and is consulted on changes in their remuneration.
In addition, on behalf of the Board, the Committee approves long-term and share-based incentive plans and the granting of awards under those plans.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Richard Kilsby, who is the Committees Chairman, Keith Hamill, Patrick OSullivan and Iain Napier who joined the Committee on his appointment as a director on 12 February 2007.
All of the members are considered independent non-executive directors.
The Chairman and Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation but do not attend those parts of meetings which deal with their own remuneration.
The Committee has access to the advice and views of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, Company Secretary and external consultants.
During the year, the Committee consulted Halliwell Consulting who provided advice on executive remuneration to assist in the formulation of the Committees recommendations.
The Committee is scheduled to hold at least three meetings a year.
During 2007, it held four meetings.
2 Policies on Remuneration of Directors The Companys objective is to maximize returns to shareholders over the medium to long term, with an acceptable level of risk.
The Companys remuneration policies are a material part of its approach to achieving this objective and reflect normal practices in that part of the financial services sector in which the Company operates.
These practices reflect the extent to which performance of the Company is dependent upon the performance of individual employees and certain of the practices are distinct from those normally adopted by UK-listed companies operating in other business sectors.
In addition, a significant proportion of the businesses against which the Company competes are not UK-listed companies.
40 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 The remuneration policies are designed to attract, retain and motivate staff who have the alternative of working for the Companys competitors.
As a consequence, and in line with competitive practices, remuneration levels are generally ahead of those paid by other UK companies of equivalent size operating in other sectors.
The Companys policy is based on a principle of high variable remuneration depending on performance.
It therefore pays relatively low base salaries and potentially high bonuses.
These bonuses are not capped as it is believed that doing so would not optimise performance.
Given the relationship between salaries and bonuses arising under this policy it is not appropriate to determine bonuses as a percentage or a multiple of remuneration.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that it is in the best interest of shareholders for the Company to follow remuneration policies which are normally adopted in its business sector and which maximise performance.
The main components of remuneration are as follows: Salaries Salaries are intended to provide a fixed monthly remuneration at a level which would be appropriate in circumstances where bonuses are not paid.
They are determined by taking account of comparable salary levels within the UK financial services sector.
The salaries of executive directors and senior employees are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee but are not automatically increased annually.
Changes are only made if salaries are considered to be out of line with salary levels elsewhere in the sector.
Discretionary Annual Performance Bonuses The main element of variable remuneration comprises annual performance bonus payments.
All bonuses paid to executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee and are discretionary.
No director has a contractual entitlement to a bonus.
The Company experiences a high level of variability in short-term financial outcomes due to varying market circumstances.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committees judgment on performance is not determined predominantly by performance against annual budgets.
In determining the performance bonus the Committee establishes a bonus pool for all executive directors.
The pool is currently determined by the following formula: 1.
Ten percent of the surplus return on average capital employed after deducting the Companys weighted average cost of capital: plus 2.
One percent of the value of absolute total shareholder returns in the year after deducting an average risk-free capital return to shareholders: plus 3.
One percent of the value of the relative total return to shareholders against the average of returns achieved by the UK FTSE 250 index and the UK FTSE General Financial Index in the year.
Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 41 Reports and Financial Statements Report on Directors Remuneration continued 2 Policies on Remuneration of Directors continued The Committee may change the formula if it concludes that doing so would be beneficial, and would record such a change in the Report on Directors Remuneration.
The Committee may decide to reduce the pool to be distributed if it concluded that it is excessive relative to performance achieved against plan, performance in market circumstances, performance against previous results and the achievement of the Companys objectives.
In exceptional circumstances it may also increase the size of the pool if it concludes that it would be clearly unfair not to do so.
The pool is then allocated between executive directors taking into consideration their personal contribution, achievement of personal objectives, comparable remuneration in competitive or comparable businesses in the sectors in which the Company operates and considerations relating to retention and motivation.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee not to pay bonuses to a director if it is not satisfied with personal performance.
If following the process the bonus pool has not been completely allocated to directors, the balance is retained by the Company.
In line with practices within the sectors in which the Company operates, this process may give rise to large bonuses.
The Board considers that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to conform with such practices.
Pensions and Other Benefits It is the Companys policy not to contribute to any pension schemes on behalf of executive directors.
In the case of executive directors who previously worked for acquired businesses a cash supplement in lieu of pension contributions may be made.
The Company provides executive directors with private medical insurance and death-inservice benefits but otherwise does not provide benefits in kind.
Long Term Incentive Plan A Long Term Incentive Plan has been established, details of which are given below.
The purpose of the plan is to retain and motivate executive directors and other senior employees and to include in their remuneration equity-based incentives.
The plan also allows for the issue of matching awards on condition that the employee acquires a specified number of shares and retains them during the vesting period.
It is intended over time to increase the proportion of total remuneration represented by long term incentive plans and reduce the proportion represented by annual bonuses.
Performance targets are intended to be stretching.
In general the Company prefers to use measures which reflect operational performance and seeks to avoid the use of earnings per share, which is relatively heavily influenced by financial arrangements.
Service Contracts It is the Companys policy that notice periods in service contracts should not exceed twelve months and that termination payments should, where possible, be mitigated.
For each director, the Company is entitled to terminate the service contract by paying, in lieu of the relevant notice period, a sum to compensate for the loss of salary and other contractual benefits excluding bonuses.
Other than as described, no benefit, payment or compensation of any kind is payable to any director upon termination of the directors contract.
42 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Non-executive Directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the Board without the participation of the non-executive directors themselves.
The fees are benchmarked against fees paid by UK-listed companies of a similar size.

Determination of Annual Performance Bonuses for the Year Ended 31 December 2007 The Remuneration Committees determination of executive directors bonuses for the year was based on surplus returns above the cost of capital on the Companys average operating assets.
No amounts were included in the bonus pool calculations in relation to absolute or comparative shareholder returns.
The bonuses also reflected the achievement of some but not all of the Companys operating and strategic objectives.
Long Term Incentive Plan and Directors Share Options The Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted by the Company in 2006 following the demerger of Collins Stewart Tullett plc.
Awards granted under the Plan, which can take the form of share options or conditional awards of shares, provide the right to a specified number of ordinary shares of the Company subject to the achievement of performance conditions prescribed by the Remuneration Committee.
The exercise price of options, if any, is also determined by the Remuneration Committee although, to date, nil-cost options have been granted under the Plan.
The number of shares over which Awards may be granted to an employee in any financial year cannot normally have a market value on the date of grant greater than 300% of the employees salary, although the Plan allowed for initial options in excess of this to be granted to Joel Plasco following the demerger.
Further details of these options are set out below.
44 Collins Stewart plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine appropriate performance targets for Awards granted under the Plan.
The Committee favours targets that, at least for a significant part of the Award, represent stretching absolute or relative targets such as hurdle rates of return on capital employed or performance relative to the sector.
The performance conditions attaching to Awards granted to executive directors during the year are described below.
The Committee may also grant matching Awards under the Plan on condition that an employee acquires a specified number of ordinary shares and retains them during the vesting period.
No matching Awards were granted to executive directors during the year.
To date, Terry Smith, in his role of Executive Chairman, has not been granted awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
This policy may be subject to review by the Remuneration Committee in the future.
Details of the share options held by directors during the year are set out below: Options at 1 January 2007 and at Earliest Final 31 December exercise exercise Exercise 2007 date date price Joel Plasco Unapproved Share Option Scheme 1,723,270 18 Oct 2007 17 Oct 2014 103p Company Share Option Plan 29,057 18 Oct 2007 17 Oct 2014 103p Unapproved Share Option Scheme 194,703 1 Nov 2007 31 Oct 2014 0.26p 1,947,030 Diana Dyer Bartlett Unapproved Share Option Scheme 155,762 22 Apr 2007 16 Nov 2007 115p Unapproved Share Option Scheme 194,703 17 May 2007 16 Nov 2007 0.26p 350,465 or at date of cessation of employment.
Prior to the demerger on 19 December 2006, Joel Plasco and Diana Dyer Bartlett each held options that were originally granted under Collins Stewart Tullett plc share option schemes.
In accordance with their respective rules, these options became exercisable as a consequence of the demerger, but the optionholders agreed to exchange them for equivalent options over the ordinary shares of Collins Stewart plc.
As a result, the options are not subject to performance conditions.
Notwithstanding the Collins Stewart Tullett scheme under which these options were originally granted, as a consequence of this exchange all these options are now unapproved.
The options held by Diana Dyer Bartlett were exercised subsequent to the cessation of her employment.

The level of vesting then depends on the degree to which the Companys total shareholder return outperforms the constituents of the FTSE General Financials Index.
At median performance, 10 per cent of the options vest, with full vesting at upper-quartile performance and straight line vesting in between.
Assuming the performance conditions are met, one half of the options are exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant and the balance between 4 and 10 years from the date of grant.
The market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year ranged from a high of 270p on 10 January 2007 to a low of 156p on 4 December 2007.
