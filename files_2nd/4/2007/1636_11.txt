AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2007 Directors report Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority together the Regulations.
The report also describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration committee The Remuneration Committees principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the Companys executive Directors and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board.
In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the executive Directors, not the Committee.
Copies of the Remuneration Committee terms of reference are available on request from the Companys registered ofce during business hours.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Committee were nalised in two formal meetings during the year, but these were preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers.
The members of the Committee were David Mann Chairman, Colin Garrett and for part of the year Nick Prest.
Nick Prest was appointed to the Remuneration Committee on his appointment to the Board on 11 January 2006 and he resigned from the Committee on 14 July 2006 in adherence with the Code provisions on independence which were in force at that time.
The amendments made to the Combined Code in 2006 now permit the Chairman of the Board to be a member of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chief Executive Richard Longdon is invited to submit recommendations to the Committee and both he and the members of the Committee take into consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration policy The Committee aims to ensure that members of the executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
It also aims for a combination of xed and variable payments, benets and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to achieve short and long-term goals.
During the year the Remuneration Committee engaged New Bridge Street Consultants to review the remuneration of the executive Directors and senior management and to benchmark their remuneration against comparable companies.
Based on the information provided by New Bridge Street Consultants, the Remuneration Committee made a recommendation, which the Board wishes to implement, concerning the introduction of a new short-term incentive plan for executive Directors and senior management.
Subject to the achievement of performance conditions, the plan would reward the recipient partly in cash and partly in shares or share equivalents.
The recipient would gain access to the shares or share equivalents in 3 equal tranches over a 3 year period, starting one year after the initial award.
The Board believes that this incentive scheme more closely aligns the interests of executive Directors and senior management with shareholders interests.
The AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option and Employee Share Option schemes originally introduced in 1996 have now expired.
By a special resolution proposed for this years Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 July 2007, the Board is therefore seeking shareholder approval to replace them with a new share option scheme.
Details of the new scheme are included in the enclosed Annual General Meeting notice.
Basic salaries In determining the basic salary of each executive Director the Committee takes account of the performance of the Company as a whole and the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility.
Bonus payments The executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus schemes determined by the Committee.
The schemes are based substantially or entirely on the performance of the Company as a whole: part may be based on the achievement of personal objectives.
Bonuses payable in the year to 31 March 2007 amounted to Richard Longdon 275,100 2006 157,000 and Paul Taylor 183,500 2006 102,000.
For the year ended 31 March 2007 there was a cap on the bonus that an executive Director could earn under the scheme and the maximum payable was 100% of basic salary.

The following graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the techMARK All Share Index.
Total shareholder return is the share price plus dividends reinvested compared against techMARK All Share Index, rebased to the start of the period.
Total shareholder return v techMARK All Share Index 2002 2007 The Directors consider the techMARK All Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes the Group.
Share awards The Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration of the Companys senior executives, in line with common practice in comparator companies.
The Companys share schemes have therefore been used to provide long-term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value.
There have been 2 schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Scheme and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of any options granted under any of the Companys share option schemes including employee schemes shall not, when aggregated with the number of shares which have been allocated in the previous 10 years under these schemes, exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to that date.
Details of the awards made under these schemes are as follows: Pre-2004 awards The AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme was established in 1996 at the time of the Companys listing on the Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange.
Options awarded under this scheme prior to 2004 are subject to performance conditions, which require earnings per share to outperform Retail Price Index utilisation RPI by a total of 10% over a 3 year rolling period.
These conditions were consistent with performance conditions commonly used at that time.
2004 awards In 2004 the Remuneration Committee commissioned a study by Deloitte & Touche LLP to review the Companys share options schemes and to make recommendations on their development.
The Board accepted those recommendations and, following consultation with shareholders, the Company established the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP which was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in 2004.
Under the LTIP options are granted to selected individuals to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the shares: these options will be exercisable only if stringent performance criteria are met.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting in 2004, shareholders also approved that the dilutions limits under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme be extended to enable further awards to be made under this scheme.
indd 8 07 06 2007 13:54:23 AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2007 Directors report In 2004, a total of 63,000 options were awarded to executive Directors under the new LTIP.
The condition of exercise for these awards is based on the ranking of the Company in terms of its total shareholder return measured against the techMARK 100 index.
The option will vest in accordance with the following scale: Total shareholder return ranking Percentage vesting of shares subject to option 75% and above 100% Median to 75% Pro rata on a straight line basis Median 33% Below median Nil The performance conditions will be measured 3 years from the date of grant.
There will be no retesting of the condition of exercise.
2005 awards In 2005, a total of 162,816 options under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme were awarded to executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee felt that awards made as market value options were better suited at that time to the Companys circumstances.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option would be that Earnings per Share EPS in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown to no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
The performance condition was judged to be appropriately stretching because of the investment planned in the VNET programme during the period.
2006 awards In 2006 a total of 42,588 share options were awarded to the executive Directors under the LTIP.
The Committee decided to revert to this scheme, with performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share, but in this case the average growth in earnings per share achieved over the 3 years from 200607 to 200809.
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of the Companys budget and market expectations at the time of the awards.
Service contracts The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms: Date of contract Date of appointment Notice period months Nick Prest 10 January 2006 11 January 2006 3 David Mann 17 May 2000 8 June 1999 3 Colin Garrett 14 July 2000 1 August 2000 3 Richard Longdon 28 November 1996 28 November 1996 12 Paul Taylor 17 October 1989 1 March 2001 9 The Committee considers that the notice periods of the executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size and nature and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management.
The Non-executive and executive Directors retire at any Annual General Meeting where they are so required by the Articles of Association.
There are no predetermined special provisions for executive or Non-executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of ofce.
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination and in exceptional circumstances will determine compensation payments in excess of the Companys contractual obligations.
