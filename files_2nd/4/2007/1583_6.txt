Remuneration Report The directors present their report on directors remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Compliance The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee is in compliance with the principles of Section 1 of the 2006 FRC Combined Code.
UNAUDITED REMUNERATION INFORMATION Members of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are Messrs. Ariko, McMonigall and Perle.
The chairman of the committee is Mr. Ariko.
Governing Principles The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving general compensation policies and setting compensation levels for executive officers.
The committee also administers incentive compensation plans.
Consistent with the policies of the 2006 FRC Combined Code, the companys policy for directors' remuneration for 2007 and subsequent financial years is that packages are intended to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre needed to achieve the companys growth program but not detract from the goals of good corporate governance.
Remuneration elsewhere within the company is taken into account when determining executive compensation.
The companys highest paid employee earns a base salary approximately five times the base salary of the average employee.
The main elements of executive pay packages historically and for the expected future are: Base salary and benefits.
Each senior executive's basic salary is determined by the Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and the companys strategies.
Employment related benefits principally the provision of a company car are also provided where appropriate.
Executive directors base salaries are low relative to similarly situated companies, with performance-based incentive compensation forming the most important factor in overall compensation.
In accordance with common practice amongst the companys peers, the company has performance related bonus plans for certain executive directors, discussed below.
Bonuses are paid based on achievement of pre-agreed targets.
The Board believes that share ownership by directors and staff aligns their personal interests with those of shareholders.
Options form the core element of the companys performance program, and are granted in small amounts from time-to-time after achievement of stretching performance targets and significant continuing contribution to value creation.
These share option awards are then subject to vesting periods, with initial vesting generally after six or 12 months with the remainder vesting quarterly over a total of 2.5 to 3.5 years.
The requirement for individuals to perform prior to granting options has been very effective in motivating performance, achieving targets and most importantly minimizing reward unconnected to an individuals performance.
It enables the company to specifically tailor share option grants to an individuals role in an efficient manner, thus avoiding the risks faced by companies in a high growth sector of unjust reward associated with simple, broad targets attached only to option exercises.
For example, a programmer might be awarded a small grant for completion of a project ahead of schedule, or a local operations manager might be awarded a small grant for effective integration of an acquired company.
This method also keeps individuals continuously incentivized as a grantee must remain employed to achieve full vesting of the options.
Finally, this method is also designed to ensure that individuals are not unjustly rewarded, which the Board believes is much more likely if large option grants are made with broad performance targets.
Under that method, an individual who was personally underperforming would undoubtedly be enriched if the company met its own broader performance targets, without making any material contribution.
It is expected that in February 2008 at the next meeting of the Remuneration Committee that new share option grants will be proposed for executive directors with new performance conditions related to the exercise of such options.
The Board sets reasonable individual grant limits.
As a result, at 31 December 2007, the Board collectively held options over less than 0.3% of outstanding equity, and options granted to the Board during 2007 totalled less than 0.09%, of the companys outstanding shares at 31 December 2007.
The total number of options granted to Board members totalled less than 7.75% of all share options outstanding at 31 December 2007.
Share options are always issued at market value.
The maximum number of share options the company is permitted to grant is up to 10% of the outstanding shares.
There has been no departure from this policy during 2007.
Advice The committee has access to professional advice from outside advisors should it require assistance.
During 2007 the directors relied on information contained in generally available reports but did not engage any firm.
Directors' remuneration is considered to be highly incentive-based given the executive directors' significant equity holdings in the company and the performance-based bonus plans.
Considerations The committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting remuneration of executive directors, and to date has had no reason to believe that the inventive structure for senior management raises risks related to such matters by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
