47 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Directors Remuneration Report This report has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
Shareholders will be invited to approve the report at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee Composition of the Committee The members of the Committee who served during the year, all of whom were independent Directors, were: Barry Gibson Chairman Roger Devlin appointed to the Committee 19 December 2007 Sue Lyons resigned 19 December 2007 Tim Score Role of the Committee The key responsibilities of the Committee are to: determine the fees of the Chairman: determine the remuneration and conditions of employment including any termination arrangements of the Executive Directors: approve the remuneration and conditions of employment of the Divisional Chief Executives and Company Secretary: review the remuneration and conditions of employment of the senior management team: and select and appoint any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website at www.
com Advisors to the Committee The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC, to advise on all aspects of senior executive remuneration.
NBSC has no other connection with the Group other than in the provision of advice on executive and employee remuneration.
The Chief Executive and Chief Executive UK Division provide guidance to the Committee on remuneration packages for senior executives employed by the Group but not in respect of their own remuneration.
Activities of the Committee During the year the Committee considered the following items of business: Executive Directors and senior executives salary levels and 2006 annual bonus awards.
Annual bonus scheme terms for 2007. Review of the Chairmans fees.
The total shareholder return comparator group used in the Long Term Incentive Plans performance condition.
2007 award levels under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan and WMT Long Service Option Scheme.
Testing of performance conditions and vesting of Executive Share Options granted in 2004.
Long Term Incentive Plan entitlements upon redundancy.
The Committees recommendations in 2007 were all accepted and implemented by the Board.
Remuneration of Non Executive Directors The fees of the Non Executive Directors are set by the Board as a whole following an annual review.
The review takes account of fees paid for similar positions in the market, the time commitment required from the Director estimated to be 100 days per year for the Chairman and 20 days per year for the other Non Executive Directors and any additional responsibilities undertaken, such as acting as Chairman to one of the Board Committees or Senior Independent Director.
Non Executive Directors are not eligible to receive pension entitlements or bonuses and may not participate in share option schemes.
For 2007 the basic fee for acting as a Non Executive Director was 43,000 a year.
A fee of 5,000 is paid for chairing a Committee.
An additional fee of 5,000 is paid to the Senior Independent Director.
The base fee for Non Executive Directors will increase to 44,000 in 2008 and the fee for chairing a Committee will increase to 7,000.
The Chairman, David Ross, has made a standing election with his brokers to invest all of his Chaimans fees in National Express Group PLC shares.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors Remuneration policy is based on the following broad principles set by the Committee: to provide a competitive remuneration package to attract and retain quality individuals: to align remuneration to drive the overall objectives of the business: to align the interests of management with the interests of shareholders: and to provide the foundation for overall reward and remuneration beyond the specific roles falling within the direct remit of the Remuneration Committee.
The objective of this policy is aligned with the recommendation of the Combined Code on Directors remuneration.
That is to provide a level of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to run the Company successfully, but avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual performance.
48 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy for Executive Directors continued In implementing its policy, the Committee gives full consideration to the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance with regard to Directors remuneration.
Remuneration policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis against the Committees broad principles and in light of emerging best practice in corporate governance.
The Group operates a leadership and development programme which includes an appraisal system for Directors and senior management.
The appraisal system uses balanced scorecards to assess performance against financial, customer, operational and people objectives.
The results of the annual appraisal system are taken into consideration when setting remuneration levels.
Fixed versus variable remuneration Performance related versus fixed remuneration % A substantial proportion of the Executive Directors pay is performance related.

Other benefits To provide competitive benefits in line Ongoing Executive Directors receive a fully expensed car, with market practice private health and long-term sickness insurance.
A cash alternative may be provided according to individual circumstances.
i Basic salary The salary of individual Executive Directors is reviewed at 1 January each year.
Account is taken of the performance of the individual concerned, together with any change in responsibilities that may have occurred and the rates for similar roles in a comparator group of companies.
The comparator group for the 2007 financial year was made up of two groups of companies.
These were a group of transport sector companies with a median market capitalisation of 1,312m and a group of companies from the FTSE Mid 250 drawn from all sectors with a median market capitalisation of 1,451m which reflected that of National Express at the time of completing the review.
For 2008 the comparator groups will be based on similar groups of transport leisure and general sector companies drawn from the FTSE 250. ii Performance related bonus The maximum potential bonus payable to Executive Directors in 2007 was 100% of salary.
70% of the bonus payable was based on financial targets and 30% based on non financial targets.
The non financial targets encompass customer, operational excellence and people objectives.
No bonus is payable unless the Groups normalised profit budget is achieved.
The definition of normalised profit is set out in the Glossary on page 116.
Directors receive 50% of that part of the bonus referable to financial targets upon achieving budget and 100% of that part upon achieving a stretch target which, for 2007, was 107% of budget.
In terms of actual performance against the targets set for the financial year under review, the stretch financial targets were met in full and, after taking into consideration performance against the non financial targets, bonus payments to Executive Directors were in the range of 95% to 100%.
For 2008 bonus payments will be based on a similar structure with the maximum potential bonus opportunity remaining at 100% of salary.
iii Pensions Under the terms of their service agreements, Executive Directors are entitled to become members of one of the Group pension schemes or, if preferred, to receive payment of a fixed percentage of salary.
49 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Adam Walker is a member of the National Express Group Staff Pension Plan the Plan which is an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved defined benefit scheme.
The benefits from this Plan are subject to HMRC limits.
Spouses pensions are provided in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Ray OToole was a member of this Plan until 7 April 2006 and he now receives a salary supplement of 44% in lieu of pension contributions.
Richard Bowker is not a member of a company pension scheme and receives a 25% salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions.
Life assurance of four times basic annual salary is provided for the Executive Directors.
iv Incentive scheme and share options a Long-term incentive arrangements The National Express Group Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting and operates as the Companys sole type of executive long-term incentive arrangement.
The LTIP consists of annual awards of performance and matching shares.
Details of the plan are provided below.
Performance shares Executive Directors are eligible to receive a conditional award of shares up to an equivalent of 1 x their annual basic salary.
The vesting of the award is conditional on meeting the performance conditions set out below.
Matching shares Executive Directors are also eligible to receive awards of matching shares that are based on a personal investment in National Express Group PLC shares funded either through a personal investment for example using an annual bonus award or through pledging of shares already held but not already allocated to the LTIP.
The maximum investment pledge is 30% of gross salary per annum.
Matching awards are based on the ratio of 100 shares for every 30 shares purchased.
This is a two for one ratio on a gross income tax basis.
Matching share awards are also conditional on the performance conditions set out below.
If a participant ceases employment before vesting for a compassionate reason eg redundancy, retirement, death in service, sale of business out of the Companys group his awards will ordinarily vest.
The extent of vesting will be determined by the pro rata application of the performance conditions up to the date of cessation unless the Committee determines that it would be inappropriate to apply a pro rata reduction.
Awards lapse on cessation of employment for any other reason.
Performance conditions There are two distinct performance conditions applying to awards made.
First, the performance condition attached to one-half of an award Part A is based on the Companys normalised diluted earnings per share EPS growth performance in excess of inflation over a fixed three year period three financial years commencing with the financial year in which the award is made.
The performance condition attached to the other half of an award Part B is based on the Companys TSR performance over the same fixed three year period relative to the TSR performance of a comparator group of 20 transport companies taken predominantly from the FTSE Industrial Transportation and FTSE Travel & Leisure sectors.
The companies comprising the comparator group have been chosen on the basis of their comparability to National Express Group PLC based on their size and scope of business operations.
There is no ability to retest either performance condition.
For awards made in 2005, 2006 and 2007 Parts A and B will vest to the extent that the performance conditions set out in the tables below are met: Average growth in the Companys normalised diluted EPS in excess of ination CPI Percentage of Part A that vests Less than 3% 0% 3% 30% 6% 100% Between 3% and 6% 30%100% pro rata Normalised diluted earnings per share and CPI are as defined in the Glossary on page 116.
Rank of the Companys Total Shareholder Return against a comparator group Percentage of Part B that vests Below median 0% Median 30% 20th percentile 100% Between median and 20th percentile 30% and 100% pro rata EPS and TSR were chosen for the LTIP as the most appropriate measures of National Expresss long-term performance since EPS remains an important growth measure and driver and TSR improves shareholder alignment and is consistent with Company objectives of providing long-term returns to shareholders.
The following table sets out the percentage of each extant award that would have vested if the performance conditions had been tested as at 31 December 2007 without making any allowance for pro rata reduction for any period of less than three years.
Indicative percentage of LTIP awards vesting based on performance to 31 December 2007 TSR element EPS element Total Year of award max 50% max 50% max 100% 2005 39.7% 28.0% 67.6% 2006 33.3% 0.0% 33.3% 2007 40.5% 50.0% 90.5% b Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Scheme The Company operates an HMRC approved Sharesave Scheme which is open to all UK employees, including the Executive Directors, who have completed at least six months service at the date of grant.
The options are exercisable after three years at a discount of 10% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
50 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance criteria The Committee believes that budgeted profit and or EPS growth as performance measures for the discretionary bonus scheme and long-term incentives provide a transparent and accessible method of gauging the performance of the Company.
The Company calculates performance against these performance measures by reference to the profit or earnings per share figures appearing in the Companys audited accounts, which the Company believes to be the most transparent and objective measure of the Companys profit or EPS.
The Committee also monitors the Groups TSR against both the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index as a measure against its peer group and the FTSE 250 Index, representing a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent member.
TSR has been used by the Company as a second performance measure for awards made to Executive Directors under the LTIP as outlined above.
Prior to making awards in 2008, the Remuneration Committee will undertake a review of the ongoing appropriateness of the range of EPS targets given the recent corporate activity of the Company and the constituents of the TSR peer group.
The following graphs show a comparison of National Express Group PLC total cumulative shareholder return against that achieved by the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index and the FTSE 250 Index.
These graphs have been selected because the Company is a constituent of each index and the Committee, therefore, feels that these are the most appropriate indices to represent the Companys relative performance.

Directors service contracts, notice periods and termination payments Executive Directors The contract dates and notice periods for the Executive Directors are as follows: Director Contract date Notice period from the Company Notice period from the Director Richard Bowker 22 May 2006 12 months 12 months Ray OToole 11 September 2003 To 1 September 2006 12 months 6 months From 1 September 2006 24 months reducing on a daily basis to 12 months by 1 September 2007 Adam Walker 11 September 2003 12 months 6 months resigned as a Director 26 March 2008 It is the Committees general policy for the notice periods of Executive Directors to be no longer than 12 months.
However, the Committee approved a notice period of 24 months for Ray OToole on the appointment of a new Chief Executive to try to ensure continuity of management during this time of change.
The notice period reduced on a daily basis between 1 September 2006 and 31 August 2007 such that on 1 September 2007 the notice period was once again 12 months.
The service contracts of Richard Bowker and Adam Walker contain a provision, exercisable at the option of the Company, to pay an amount on early termination of employment equal to one years salary.
In the case of Ray OToole the early termination payment has fallen from two years at 1 September 2006 to one years salary at 1 September 2007.
The Company will use the payment in lieu of notice provisions when the speed, certainty and protection of restrictive covenants afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the Company and the circumstances surrounding the departure of the relevant Director justify their use.
The service contracts of Ray OToole and Adam Walker have a further provision that, where the Company initiates a termination, other than for cause, within six months of a change of control taking place the Company will exercise its option to make a payment in lieu of notice of an amount equal to the salary and benefits that the Director would have received during the notice period.
In any event the Committees policy is that payments to Directors on termination should reflect the circumstances that prevail at the time, also taking account of the Directors duty to mitigate if appropriate.
Under the terms of their service agreements, Board approval is required before any external appointment may be accepted by an Executive Director.
