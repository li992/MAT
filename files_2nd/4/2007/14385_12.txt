Directors remuneration report Introduction The Directors remuneration report is presented to shareholders by the Board.
The report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 20 November 2007 inviting them to approve this report.
The Remuneration Committee Mr Brydon and Mr Challen were members of the Committee throughout the financial year.
As previously mentioned, Mr OLeary died on 14 August 2006.
Sir Julian Horn-Smith was Chairman of the Committee up to his retirement from the Board on 21 November 2006.
Mr Chambers became Chairman of the Committee on 12 December 2006.
Sir Nigel Broomfields appointment ceased when he retired as a director on 31 March 2007.
Mr Loescher joined the Committee on 1 June 2007.
Mr Brydon is absent when his own remuneration as Chairman of the Company is under consideration.
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation: he is absent when his own remuneration is under consideration.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Groups general policy relating to executive remuneration.
It also determines, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive directors including their annual bonus targets and grants of share awards and for the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available for inspection on the Companys website.
The Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance July 2003 issue relating to directors remuneration throughout the financial year save that, as explained on page 28, the Chairman is a member of the Committee.
Although the June 2006 issue of the Combined Code did not apply to the Company until 1 August 2007, the Company was fully compliant with the provisions of the 2006 issue throughout 2006 07.
The Committee meets regularly and takes advice from both inside and outside the Group on a range of matters, including the scale and composition of the total remuneration package payable to people with similar responsibilities, skills and experience in comparable industrial companies which are UK-based but which, like Smiths, have extensive operations outside the UK.
During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from the Chief Executive and from the General Counsel who is also Secretary to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee received material assistance and advice from: Towers Perrin, remuneration consultants: and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, solicitors.
Towers Perrin, who also provided remuneration and pensions advice to the Company during the year, were appointed by the Committee.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, who were appointed by the Company, also advised the Group on various discrete legal matters during the year.
The remuneration of directors is set out in tables on pages 36 and 37.
Remuneration policy The Committee believes that the individual contributions made by the executive directors are fundamental to the successful performance of the Company.
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy which will continue to apply during 2007 08 with the following objectives: a performance-related remuneration should seek to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders: b a significant proportion of remuneration should be based on operational and financial performance both in the short and long term, as well as the individual contributions made by the executive directors: and c the remuneration packages for executive directors should be competitive in terms of market practice in order to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 33 Directors remuneration report continued The following graph shows the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the past five years.
As required by the Regulations, the Companys TSR is compared with a broad equity market index.
The index chosen here is the FTSE 100 Index which provides an effective indication of the TSR performance of other leading UK-listed companies.
The Company has been a constituent of this index throughout the period.

Elements of remuneration Executive directors remuneration comprises: basic salary, benefits in kind, annual bonus and pension benefits.
In addition, executive directors and senior executives participate in certain share-based incentive schemes, currently comprising the Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, the Smiths Group Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan and the Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan the Co-Investment Plan.
The Performance Share Plan and the Co-Investment Plan were both approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2004.
Executive directors continue to hold awards under predecessor schemes, being the Smiths Industries 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme the 1995 Scheme and the Smiths Industries Senior Executive Deferred Share Scheme the Deferred Share Scheme.
The annual bonus element and executive share incentives are linked to performance.
The Committee regards participation in share-based incentive schemes as a key element in the executive directors remuneration packages.
The first grant of awards under the Performance Share Plan to executive directors and senior executives who consequently no longer receive grants under the 1995 Scheme took place in 2004 05, and further grants were made in 2005 06 and 2006 07.
Executive directors and senior executives participated in the Co-Investment Plan, which replaced the Deferred Share Scheme, in 2005 06 and 2006 07.
Further information on the share plans is set out below.
Salary and benefits in kind Salaries are reviewed annually for each executive director.
The Committee takes into account individual performance and experience, the size and nature of the role, the relative performance of the Company, pay policy within the Company and the salaries in comparable industrial companies.
The Committee revised the peer group of companies used to assess the competitiveness of the Companys remuneration packages following the disposal of Smiths Aerospace and corporate activity affecting peer group members.
Benefits include a fully expensed company car or an allowance in lieu, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and education expenses.
Bonuses Executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual bonus plan based on a combination of corporate financial goals and individual achievements which, for 2006 07, included individual contributions toward transformational actions occurring during the year.
The maximum level of bonus that may be awarded for the financial year 2007 08 is 100% Chief Executive 120% of salary.
The Committee intends to review this level annually to ensure that it remains appropriately competitive.
Bonuses paid to executive directors in respect of the 2006 07 financial year are set out in the table on page 36.
Executive directors and other senior executives are eligible, if invited, to participate in the Co-Investment Plan.
Under this plan, participants are able to invest in shares an amount determined annually by the Committee not exceeding the full amount of their annual bonus or, if greater, 25% of salary in both cases, on an after-tax basis.
If the participant remains in service for three years, he will, subject to the Company satisfying a performance condition, be eligible to receive a one-for-one matching share award based on the pre-tax amount of salary or deferred bonus in question.
The applicable performance condition is that the Companys average return on capital employed over the performance period should exceed the Companys weighted average cost of capital over the same period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
The Committee regards this condition as appropriate as it is a test of the operating efficiency of the Company but this will remain subject to annual review.
There will be no retesting of the performance condition.
Dr Ferrie left the Group on completion of the disposal of Smiths Aerospace in May 2007.
In the light of his exceptional contribution to the sale process, his bonus was calculated by reference to his full annual salary for the 2006 07 financial year, rather than the salary paid in the period to May 2007.
No compensation payment was made to Dr Ferrie when he left the Group.
34 Smiths Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Value of hypothetical 100 holding Pensions The Company operates a number of different pension arrangements for executive directors, generally reflecting the individuals pension arrangements at the time he was appointed to the Board.
In the case of Mr Butler-Wheelhouse, the Company pays a monthly salary supplement of a percentage of salary approved by the Committee to enable him to make his own pension provision.
In the cases of Messrs Langston and Lillycrop, final salary schemes provide a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
The Company continues to apply an earnings cap, on a basis similar to the pre-2006 statutory limit, to determine the proportion of overall pension payable by the regulated pension scheme, with the balance of pension provided by the Company: these arrangements substantially represent a continuation of pre-2006 practice and involve no additional cost for the Company.
In appropriate cases, the Company permits the waiver of salary and pension supplement entitlements where the arrangement does not involve additional cost for the Company.
Where such waivers are made, incentives and pension entitlements continue to be calculated by reference to salaries prior to these reductions.
Details of the salary supplements, waiver and other pension provisions are set out in the tables on pages 36 and 37.
Directors annual bonus payments and any gains under share incentive schemes are not pensionable.
Share options and performance shares The Company operates a number of share incentive schemes for executive directors and other employees.
The 1995 Scheme was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 1995 and amended in 2001.
For executive directors and other senior executives the 1995 Scheme was replaced by the Performance Share Plan in 2004.
The 1995 Scheme continues to cover approximately 330 executives whose awards are approved by the Committee.
Under the Performance Share Plan, the maximum value of share awards which may normally be made annually to executive directors and other senior executives to date is 150% of base salary.
The Committee has power in exceptional circumstances such as the recruitment of an executive director to make share awards up to a maximum value of 300% of base salary.
Grants to executive directors in 2005 05 and 2006 07 have been at the maximum of 150% of base salary.
For 2007 08, the Committee, having reviewed the competitiveness of the overall executive director remuneration packages, intends to grant awards to executive directors at a reduced level of 133.3% of base salary in the case of the Chief executive and 112.5% of base salary in other cases.
Awards will be released after three years to the extent a performance condition is met.
One-third of the award is subject to a TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the Companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three year performance period.
25% of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straight-line pro rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award will be subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
For the three year cycle commencing in 2006 07, full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% per annum.
25% vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% per annum, with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
The Committee considers the use of two measures, in these proportions, to be appropriate.
The TSR performance measure is dependent on the Companys relative long-term share price performance, and therefore brings a market perspective to the Performance Share Plan.
This is balanced by a key internal measure, EPS growth, which is critical to our long-term success and ties in with the Groups strategic goals.
The Committee determined the threshold and maximum vesting levels operated to date after considering the Companys historic performance and future plans, and on the basis of external advice.
Having recently reviewed these and other factors the Committee continues to consider that the achievement of compound annual EPS growth of 12% per annum is a suitably demanding target for maximum vesting.
This will remain subject to annual review.
There will be no retesting of the TSR and EPS performance measures.
The Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with 12 months service, is subject to UK legislation as to the amount that can be saved.
Participants save a fixed sum per month for three or five years and may use the sum generated by their savings contracts to exercise the options which are usually granted at a 20% discount to the market price.
In the financial year ended 31 July 2007, executive directors exercised share options and at 31 July 2007 held unexercised options and share awards as described in the table on pages 39 to 41.
With the exception of the exercise of Sharesave options by Mr Langston and Mr Lillycrop on 1 August 2007 and the lapse, on 8 September 2007, of the TI executive scheme options granted to Mr Langston and Mr Lillycrop on 8 September 1997, there were no changes in the options and awards held by directors between 1 August and 24 September 2007.
The Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection contains full details of directors shareholdings, options to acquire shares in the Company and share awards.
Impact of the Return of Cash and 2 for 3 share capital consolidation Participants under the Smiths Group share schemes are not the beneficial owners of the shares under their options and awards and so were unable to participate in the Return of Cash other than in respect of shares beneficially owned by them, including shares acquired for the purposes of participation in certain of the share schemes.
The Board determined that no adjustment should be made to their options and awards as the 2 for 3 share capital consolidation had the effect of maintaining the value of these options and awards, subject to normal market fluctuations.
Following the 2 for 3 share capital consolidation, all such participants remained entitled to receive the same number of shares on exercise of their options and or vesting of their awards as under their previous entitlement.
Participants in the Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan, who are required to make an investment in shares Invested Shares as a condition to the grant of a matching award over shares Matching Award, were entitled to participate in the Return of Cash in respect of their Invested Shares.
Such participants had the choice to reinvest the Return of Cash received in respect of their Invested Shares less an allowance for tax liabilities in which case no adjustment was made to their Matching Award for the reasons stated above.
Alternatively, they could elect not to reinvest, in which case the number of shares under their Matching Award would be reduced on a basis which reflects the 2 for 3 share capital consolidation.
All directors elected for the first alternative and will reinvest in accordance with an agreed timetable.
Participants in the predecessor share plan, the Smiths Industries Senior Executive Deferred Share Scheme, where the final award matures in December 2007, were entitled to retain the Return of Cash proceeds received in respect of their invested shares, and their options were not adjusted.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 35 Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration The total remuneration of directors, excluding the value of shares to which certain directors may become entitled under the Deferred Share Scheme, Performance Share Plan and Co-Investment Plan and also defined benefit pension arrangements, was as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Fees, salaries and benefits 2,740 3,207 Performance-related bonuses 1,943 2,047 Gain from exercise of share options 3,479 1,488 Incremental gain from deferred share scheme exercises 363 153 Payments in lieu of pension contribution 544 561 9,069 7,456 The emoluments of the directors are set out below: Payments in lieu of pension Fees salary Benefits Bonus contribution Total emoluments 2007 2006 2007 2007 2007 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Chairman D H Brydon 273 260 20 293 280 Chief Executive K O Butler-Wheelhouse 840 811 46 826 420 2,132 2,084 Executive directors J Langston 400 358 33 355 788 738 D P Lillycrop 359 342 69 359 787 737 Non-executive directors D J Challen 65 57 65 57 S J Chambers appointed 27 11 06 40 40 P J Jackson 65 63 65 63 P H Loescher appointed 01 06 07 8 8 Sir Kevin Tebbit appointed 14 06 06 50 6 50 6 Former directors Sir Nigel Broomfield retired 31 03 07 33 48 33 48 J Ferrie resigned 04 05 07 309 392 56 403 124 892 843 Sir Julian Horn-Smith retired 21 11 06 20 52 20 52 R W OLeary deceased 14 08 06 4 48 4 48 Lord Robertson of Port Ellen resigned 27 02 06 32 32 A M Thomson retired 06 09 06 46 436 4 50 827 2,512 2,905 228 1,943 544 5,227 5,815 Mr Thomson, a former director, also received 276,839 in cash and benefits pursuant to a consultancy agreement operating between 7 September 2006 and 31 March 2007.
Sir Nigel Broomfield, a former director, also received 6,667 pursuant to a consultancy agreement operating between 1 April and 31 July 2007.
Shares which may be awarded under the Deferred Share Scheme, Performance Share Plan and Co-Investment Plan are as set out in the directors share options table on pages 39 to 41.
Under the arrangements approved by the Remuneration Committee, Mr Butler-Wheelhouse and Mr Thomson have waived entitlements to certain of their emoluments in return for the Company making equivalent amounts of contributions to the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme to provide money purchase benefits, which does not involve additional cost for the Company.
Under these arrangements, Mr Butler-Wheelhouse waived 171,328 and Mr Thomson 88,665 during the year.
The amounts waived would otherwise have been paid to Mr Butler-Wheelhouse as payments in lieu of pension contributions and Mr Thomson as salary or consultancy fee.
For reasons of clarity, all amounts referred to are included in the table above.
In common with other UK employees participating in the relevant pension schemes, the salaries of Messrs Langston, Lillycrop and Thomson were reduced by 8,250, 8,250 and 5,556 respectively and the Company paid the same amount directly to the pension schemes during the year.
For reasons of clarity, the salaries shown in the table above for these directors are the amounts they would have been paid if they had not given up these salary entitlements.

His total accrued entitlement on retirement was 252,643 p. a. which he took in the form of an annual pension.
His pension in payment was increased on 1 May 2007, in accordance with the normal scheme increases, and is 259,128 p. a. at 31 July 2007.
An executive directors normal retirement age is 60.
An early retirement pension, based on actual service completed, may be paid after age 50 and may be subject to a reduction on account of early payment.
On death, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the directors pension or for death-in-service his prospective pension at age 60 is payable.
All pensions in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP are guaranteed to increase at the lesser of i in the case of Mr Thomson, 5% per annum compound and, in the case of Messrs Langston and Lillycrop, 7% per annum compound and ii the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index.
There has, however, been a long-standing practice of granting additional discretionary increases on pensions in excess of the GMP to bring them into line with price inflation.
The benefits provided under the relevant pension schemes were not affected by these arrangements.
Separately, as described in Note 2 on page 36, additional pension benefits were provided to Mr Thomson following his waiver of a further 88,665 of salary.
Transfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance GN11, and represent the amount that the pension scheme would pay to another pension provider if the member elects to transfer all of his benefits out of the scheme.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to the individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.

Smiths Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 37 Directors remuneration report continued Share ownership It is the Companys policy that executive directors should, over time, acquire a shareholding with a value equal to at least one and a half years gross salary.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of predetermined damages in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 26 September 2001, as varied by a letter dated 31 July 2007.

Options granted under the 95 ESOS can only be exercised after three years if a performance requirement, determined by the Remuneration Committee, has been met.
Options granted under the 95 ESOS up to 2001 were subject to performance testing based on total shareholder return of the Company versus the total return of the General Industrials Sector of the FTSE All Shares Index.
Options granted from 2002 are subject to a performance test based on growth in the Companys earnings per share.
If the performance requirement is not satisfied at the end of the third year, the performance period may be extended for up to two further years so that performance is tested over a four year period at the end of the fourth year and a five year period at the end of the fifth year.
The performance requirement is that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share over the three four five financial years beginning immediately prior to the option grant must exceed the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period by 3% per annum for options up to one times base salary and by 4% per annum for the excess up to two times base salary.
The performance tests for options granted up to and including October 2003 have all been passed with the sole exception of the grant on 9 April 2002, which failed its initial test and two retests.
No further retests of the April 2002 grant will be undertaken.
The April 2002 grant can now only be exercised in the event of a change in control of the Company or by certain good leavers.
Dr Ferrie qualified as such a good leaver and his April 2002 option vested on his cessation of employment.
Mr Thomsons April 2002 option has not vested.
Under the DSS executive directors were able to use their after-tax bonus to purchase the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the Director is still in office, he can exercise an option granted to him over matching shares, in respect of any shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares awarded was determined by the Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus was earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The last grant under the DSS was made on 7 December 2004, in respect of bonus earned in the year to 31 July 2004, and matched shares purchased in the market by the grantee on that day.
At 31 July 2007 the trustee of the DSS held 634,274 shares for the benefit of senior executives including the directors as disclosed above.
The market value of these shares at that date was 6.64m and dividends of approximately 246,567 were waived in the year in respect of the shares.
There are no performance criteria for the SAYE, DSS or the TI 90 ESOS.
Special provisions permit early exercise of options and vesting of awards in the event of retirement: redundancy: death: etc.
