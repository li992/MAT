NEW STAR ASSET MANAGEMENT GROUP PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report describes the Groups overall remuneration policy and gives details of the compensation and contractual arrangements for directors.
The report has been prepared in compliance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Combined Code.
Legislation requires the Groups auditors to audit certain disclosures within this report.
Where disclosures have been audited they are indicated as such.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 27.
Employee compensation is based currently on the principle that equity participation is offered to all its employees, thereby ensuring that all staff work towards the same goals and there is an alignment of interests between employees and external shareholders.
The Group attracts and motivates high-calibre management and employees throughout the organisation who are incentivised by, amongst other things, this equity participation.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION Executive directors salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Consideration is given to the full compensation package inclusive of equity incentives.
The directors do not participate under the Companys approved and unapproved share incentive schemes or any other scheme, with the exception of Richard Pease, who manages hedge funds where there is an entitlement, in line with market practice, to a percentage of any performance fee received from the funds he manages.
With the exception of John Duffield, the executive directors receive healthcare membership, life and permanent health insurance cover and membership of the Groups pension scheme.
The New Star Pension Scheme is a HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved occupational defined contribution scheme open to all permanent employees who have been in service for three months.
The employers contribution to this scheme on behalf of all employees, including executive directors, is 15% of basic salary.
The Group life insurance cover provides death in service benefits, currently amounting to four times basic salary.
The executive directors are employed under continuing contracts of employment that can be terminated by either party under notice provisions of up to three months, with no provision for compensation payable by the Company on early termination.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION The non-executive directors have each been appointed for three-year terms with one-month notice periods.
The letters of appointment do not contain a provision for termination payments other than the unexpired period of the appointment.
The non-executive directors received the fees disclosed on page 32 and do not receive any other group benefits, with the exception of Martin Smith, who receives healthcare membership.

SHARE OPTION SCHEME The Company has adopted an HMRC-approved and an unapproved option scheme, The New Star 2007 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Options may be granted to employees and executive directors subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The share option scheme operates over all ordinary shares.
Options issued under the scheme may normally only be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date on which the option was granted.
No options have been granted to the directors in the year and no directors hold any share options in the Company.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The Regulations require the inclusion of a graph that illustrates the total shareholders return for a holding in the Companys shares against a broad equity market index for a period of five years.
As New Star only gained admission to the AIM market in November 2005, the graph shows the performance for the Company since admission.
The New Star share performance has been adjusted for the June 2007 Capital repayment and share reorganisation.
The FTSE 250 Total Return Index of companies has been used as the comparator index as it is the index that included the Company at the year end and contains similar-sized companies in a variety of sectors including a number of asset management companies.
