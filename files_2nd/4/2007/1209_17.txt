Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report is prepared in pounds sterling as the Company is headquartered in England and the Directors are predominantly paid in that currency.
The report describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration.
The Board has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
An Ordinary Resolution to approve this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, but the Directors remuneration is not conditional upon the resolution being passed.
The report has been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Malcolm Field and the other members are Peter Hambro and Sir Roderic Lyne.
None of the members of the Remuneration Committee has any personal financial interest other than as Shareholders or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the review of the performance of the Executive Directors.
The remuneration and conditions of employment of Executive Directors and senior Executives are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Directors abstain from decisions determining their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee works with the Chief Executive on all aspects of remuneration and sets the remuneration of the Chief Executive.
The scale and structure of the Executive Directors remuneration is approved on the basis of their performance, the performance of the Company and their service agreements with due regard to the interests of the Shareholders and the Company as a whole.
The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board concerning employee incentives.
Bearing in mind the provisions of the Combined Code, the Remuneration Committee is required to review at least annually the remuneration package comprising base salary, any performance-related element of salary or bonus, participation in share option schemes and other benefits of each Executive Director as proposed by the Chief Executive or previously agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is required, at least once a year, to review its own performance, constitution and terms of reference to ensure it is operating at maximum effectiveness and recommend any changes it considers necessary to the Board.
Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors The Group operates in a highly competitive market place for senior skilled management which places a strong emphasis on above average rewards for outstanding performance.
An overriding objective is to ensure that the approach to remuneration is simple and clear.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre needed to develop and run the Groups businesses and to reward them for enhancing value to Shareholders.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
As a result, the Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performancerelated.
As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the benefits of long term share option incentives.
The basis of the Companys remuneration policy is that the remuneration is decided annually by the Remuneration Committee and varies accordingly.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management: basic annual salary: benefits-in-kind: performance based bonus payments: share option incentives: and pension arrangements.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing that the Chairmans permission is obtained in advance of any such appointment.
Jay Hambro is also a Non-Executive Director of Peter Hambro Mining plc and received an annual fee of 61,000 for the year ended 31 December 2007.

uk Directors Remuneration Report continued Basic Salary Each Executive Directors basic salary is reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries were reviewed in February 2007 with increases taking effect from 1 January 2007.
Executive Directors contracts of service will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Benefits-in-Kind The Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, for example car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus Payments The Committee establishes specific objectives that must be met for each financial year if a performance-related bonus is to be paid: the objectives for 2007 are shown below.
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Companys Shareholders.
Account is also taken of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which the Executive Directors are responsible and the extent to which the strategic objectives set by the Board are being met.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary.
In exceptional circumstances specifically described, the Remuneration Committee can award bonuses above 100% of annual salary.
Incentive payments for the year ended 31 December 2007 varied between 44% and 134% of basic salary.
The objectives for Executive Directors for 2007 covered securing the assets of key projects such as K&S, Garinskoye, progressing the arrangements with Chinalco for the development of titanium sponge and the successful preparation for production at Kuranakh.
In addition key management objectives have been put in place for the operational development and delivery of these projects.
Bonuses were awarded for these achievements.
Share Options During the year ended 31 December 2003, following approval at the Annual General Meeting, the Company established a share option scheme the Share Option Scheme.
The reason for the scheme was to incentivise the Executive Directors.
The Committee had responsibility for supervising the scheme and the grant of options under its terms.
There were no performance criteria to be met as it was considered that the share price performance was the best indicator of performance of the Executive Directors and the options granted could be exercised after a period of three years from the date the option was granted.
Thereafter the option could be exercised for the rest of its life without further test, normally provided the grantee is still in employment with the Company.
The exercise price of the options granted under the above scheme would be equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the time when the options were granted.
The Companys policy has been to grant options to Directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance normally up to a maximum of two times annual salary.
It has been the Companys policy to phase the granting of share options rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual other than on commencement of employment.
No amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options.
No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under the Companys existing share option scheme following the establishment of the Long Term Incentive Plan see below.
Long Term Incentive Plan During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Company established a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP to operate in conjunction with an Employee Benefit Trust EBT to provide an effective and flexible means of holding assets for the benefit of employees and their families and providing valuable long-term benefits.
Contributions to the EBT will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, which will also recommend allocations under the LTIP.
The EBT is administered and operated by a third party trustee.
The potential beneficiaries of the LTIP include a number of the Executive Directors see table below and also some senior managers within the Group.
The LTIP will have a qualification period of three years and a number of embedded objectives will need to be fulfilled for the LTIP to vest.
These objectives, which apply to all Directors, relate to: Production and profitability targets at the Kuranakh project: Maintenance of health and safety standards: Development targets at the Groups other key projects: and Further successful expansion to the portfolio of assets.
The Remuneration Committee has provided a weighting system for these performance objectives to enforce the importance and timing of each and will advise the trustees of the EBT on the completion of the LTIP and have the ability to make recommendations to alter the objectives should they become inappropriate.

These shares are held by the EBT on behalf of the potential participants for the vesting period and, should the Remuneration Committee advise the Trustees that the LTIP objectives have been successfully achieved, the shares will be sold, the loan repaid and the gains on the shares passed to the participants.
The allocations made under the LTIP are disclosed on page 54.
The following rules have been set for the operation of the LTIP: The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be allocated under the LTIP shall not exceed at any time 5% of the Companys issued share capital: The number of ordinary shares which may be held in the EBT shall not at any time exceed 5% of the Companys issued share capital: The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be provided to an employee under the LTIP in any financial year shall be limited to 200% of annual salary, calculated by reference to the market value of the ordinary shares at the date of allocation: No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under the Companys existing share option scheme: and Awards under the LTIP will be subject to agreed performance conditions as established by the Remuneration Committee.
However, completion of the performance conditions can be waived by the trustees at their sole discretion, but having regard to any recommendations by the Remuneration Committee, in circumstances where such conditions have become either inappropriate or overly onerous by external circumstances.
Pension Arrangements Executive Directors have their own pension arrangements and are not members of a company pension scheme.
The Company has agreed to make contributions equivalent to between 10% and 17.5% of basic salary into the personal approved pension schemes of the Directors and employees.
Amounts paid to Directors are set out in the Schedule of Directors Emoluments and Compensation on page 52.
Directors Contracts It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts for an indefinite term providing for up to a maximum of one years notice.
However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new Directors.
Where this arises, it is the Companys policy to reduce the notice period to one year within two years of appointment of the Director.
The service contract of Jay Hambro, who was appointed a Director in 2006, provides for a notice period of twelve months.
All other Executive Directors have contracts which are subject to either three or six months notice by either party.
Sir Malcolm Field, Brian Egan and Yuri Makarov are proposed for re-election at the next annual general meeting.
Their notice periods, and those of the other Directors, are as follows: Date of contract Notice period Executive Directors: Brian Egan 10 07 2007 6 months Jay Hambro 01 09 2006 12 months Yuri Makarov 26 04 2004 3 months Martin Smith 04 04 2006 6 months Non-Executive Directors: Sir Malcolm Field 01 01 2007 3 months Peter Hambro 12 12 2003 3 months Sir Roderic Lyne 26 09 2006 3 months Dr Pavel Maslovskiy 12 12 2003 3 months In the event of early termination, the Directors contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for the notice period.
No compensation will be payable when a Directors appointment is terminated for reasons of unsatisfactory performance.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board and based on independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies.
In February 2007, the basic fee paid to each Non-Executive Director in the year was set at 30,000.
The Non-Executive Directors receive further fees for additional work performed for the Company in respect of membership of the Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee, Health, Safety and Environmental Committee and Audit Committee.
The additional fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are at a rate of 10,000 for membership of a committee and 5,000 for chairmanship of a committee.
The Chairman of the Company is paid a further 65,000 and the Senior Non-Executive Director a further 15,000.
Non-Executive Directors were not able to participate in the Companys share option scheme with the exception of options granted at the initial listing of the Company on AIM.
