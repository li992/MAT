Participation in the Plan is available to executive directors and selected members of the Executive Council.
The Plan aligns the long-term interests of participants with those of the Company and its shareholders and is designed to deliver superior performance from participants and to improve shareholder value.
The Plan rewards executives with shares rather than cash benefits.
Awards are subject to a three-year performance period prior to vesting.
Information on the awards made in 2004 The 2004 awards were calculated by taking half of the executives salary at the start of the financial year and dividing it by the Whitbread share price averaged over the five business days preceding the start of the performance period.
The performance measure was TSR.
The awards would have vested in part if the Company had performed at median, increasing to full vesting for top quartile performance relative to the comparator Group of companies.
This means that at the 50th percentile, 50% of the award would have been paid and at the 75th percentile, 100% of the award would have been paid, with a straight line operating in between.
Whitbreads actual ranking against the comparator Group for the 2004 LTIP award was ninth out of 22 comparators.
As a result, the awards have partially vested at a level of 72.7%.
Information on the awards made in 2005, 2006 and 2007 The 2005 and 2007 awards were made as part of the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme.
Executive directors were entitled to an award based on 25% of salary at the threshold level of performance, 62.5% at on target performance and 125% at stretch performance, with a straight line operating in between.
Awards made in 2005 and 2006 are subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
The awards will vest in part if the Company performs at median, increasing to full vesting for top quartile performance relative to the comparator Group of companies.
This means that at the 50th percentile, 25% of the award will vest and at the 75th percentile, 100% of the award will vest, with a straight line operating in between.
Awards made in 2007 will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition for half of the award and an EPS growth target for the other half of the award.
Further details can be found on pages 11 to 12 of the remuneration report.
Information on future awards Details on the policy with regard to future awards under the Plan can be found on page 11.
Comparator Groups The comparator Group for the awards made in 2004 and 2005 were the constituents of the FTSE All Share Hotels and Leisure index with a market capitalisation of over 150 million as at 1 March 2004 and 1 March 2005 respectively.
The comparator Group for the awards made in 2006 was the constituents of the Hotels, Restaurants & Bars and Recreational Services sub-sectors of the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Sector Index, with a market capitalisation of over 150 million.
