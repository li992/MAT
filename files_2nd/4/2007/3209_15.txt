iii The scheme commenced in 2007.
The purchase of deferred and investment shares, the transfer of shares already held and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 4 April 2007.
The following table gives details of the LTIS allocations held by Executive Directors who served during the year: Vested during 2007 In performance period 1 April 1 April 3 April 4 September Date of allocation 2004 i 2005 ii 2006 iii iv 2006 iii 4 April 2007 iii Phil Bentley 161,569 165,646 278,849 295,851 Sam Laidlaw 431,837 459,483 Nick Luff 276,545 Jake Ulrich 166,223 168,926 278,849 295,851 Market price at allocation date 232.00p 228.00p 284.00p 302.50p 391.50p End of performance period 31 Mar 07 31 Mar 08 31 Mar 09 31 Aug 09 31 Mar 10 i Market price at vesting date 386.00p i At the end of the performance period to 31 March 2007, the Company ranked 38th in the relevant comparator group.
Accordingly, 78.3% of the original allocations were released to participants on 4 April 2007.
The released shares were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and National Insurance contributions NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2007 on page 48. ii At the end of the performance period the Companys TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator group.
If, and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors at the Trustees discretion as soon as practicable thereafter.
iii The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year performance period: half of the shares EPS shares will be subject to a performance condition based on the Groups adjusted EPS growth relative to the growth in RPI over three financial years.
EPS growth will be calculated by comparing the Groups adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later: and half of the shares will be determined by the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the other companies comprising the LTIS comparator group the FTSE 100 at the start of the three-year performance period the TSR shares.
At the end of the performance period, the TSR performance condition will be measured, the same calculation made for all the other 99 companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled.
iv The first awards under the new LTIS approval was sought and given by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2006 were made to participants other than the Executive Directors on 3 April 2006 on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42-day period following the release of the Companys annual results.
The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards with those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the number of shares, the adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.

50 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Directors pensions Of the four Executive Directors, Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich are members of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme CMPS.
Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centricas pension schemes.
CMPS The CMPS is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme.
Its rules provide for the following main features: normal retirement at age 62: right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service at Companys request after age 55: life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service: spouses pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the members prospective pension and, on death after retirement, half of the accrued pension.
Childrens pensions are also payable: members contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings.
Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme CUPS are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings above the scheme earnings cap: pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI a maximum of 6% applies to pension accrued after 6 April 2004 : and no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC limits.
Where these limits would restrict the pension promise due, the CUPS provides benefits on the salary in excess of the CMPS earnings cap to the level that would otherwise have been paid by the registered scheme.
The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the registered portion of members benefits.
No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Companys balance sheet.
Pension benefits earned by Directors in the CMPS Accrued Accrued Increase Transfer Transfer Transfer value of pension as at pension as at in accrued value as at value as at Contribution Difference in increase in 31 December 31 December pension less 31 December 31 December paid in transfer value accrued pension 2007 i 2006 inflation ii 2007 2006 2007 less contributions excluding inflation Phil Bentley 126,900 107,500 15,208 1,396,800 978,700 34,020 384,080 124,000 Jake Ulrich 212,600 186,800 18,515 3,200,500 2,312,600 34,020 853,880 217,400 i Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to and pensionable salary at 31 December 2007.
The pension accrual rates for 2007 for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich were, 2.65% and 3.71% respectively.
ii The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2006 by the rate of inflation 3.9% and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2007.
The rate of inflation used was 3.9%, the annual rate to 30 September 2007, the date used for pension increases under the scheme.
Pay in lieu of pension provision Under the terms of their contracts of employment, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff are entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension provision of 40% and 30% of base salary, respectively.
