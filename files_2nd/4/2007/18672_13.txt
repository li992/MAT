Directors Remuneration Report Directors remuneration The Board recognises that directors remuneration is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to following current best practice.
In accordance with Section 241A of the Companies Act 1985, the Board presents the directors remuneration report for shareholder approval.
Information not subject to audit Remuneration Committee The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on request and are included on the Companys website at www.
The Remuneration Committee Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board to determine the Companys general policy on salary, bonuses, pensions and other remuneration issues for individual directors.
It carries out the policy on behalf of the Board and in the year under review the Committee met six times.
A record of attendance at these meetings is shown on page 27.
The membership of the Committee is as follows: Giles Weaver Chairman Antony Beevor Wilf Weeks Andrew Gulliford All the members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters to be decided other than as shareholders, potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships nor any day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee consults the Managing Director and Finance Director about its proposals and has access to professional advice from inside and outside the Company.
During the year under review the Committee were advised by New Bridge Street Consultants in relation to the performance criteria of the Companys share option schemes and Performance Share Plan.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The Company operates within a competitive environment and its performance depends on the individual contributions of the directors and employees.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the Companys position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value and return.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration packages of individual directors are structured so that the performance related elements form a significant proportion of the total and are designed to align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Share incentives are designed so that they recognise the long-term growth of the Company.
No director has a service contract of more than one year.
There are four main elements to the executive directors remuneration packages: i basic annual salary, pension contributions and benefits-in-kind: ii annual sector bonus payments: iii Executive Bonus Plan: and, iv share incentives.
Basic annual salary, pension contributions and benefits-in-kind Basic annual salaries for executive directors are reviewed having regard to individual performance and market practice and were last reviewed in April 2005.
The remuneration packages of each executive director include a payment of 20% of basic salary as pension entitlement.
Each director takes this entitlement as additional salary.
Benefits-in-kind provided to executive directors include the provision of a company car and health insurance.
Annual sector bonus payments The Committee establishes the objectives which must be met for annual cash bonuses to be paid.
Performance related cash bonuses, which recognise the relative success of the different parts of the business, may be paid to the executive directors responsible for their parts.
A proportion of the Groups total administration costs is deducted in arriving at each sector bonus.
The maximum amount payable in each year is 1m to each of the Development and Investment Directors.
The sector bonus payable to the Development Director is based on the development profits generated by that director in the year.
The Sector Bonus payable to the Investment Director is based on the profits and gains made on the investment and trading portfolio by that director in the year net of associated finance costs.
Payment of annual sector bonuses is at the discretion of the Committee.
31 Helical Bar plc Report & Accounts 2007 Corporate Governance Executive Bonus Plan The Company operates an Executive Bonus Plan 2006 Plan designed to align the motivations of the senior management team with the interests of shareholders and to link their remuneration to the performance of the Companys property portfolio.
The Plan operates over a five year period from 1 April 2006 and cash bonuses will be paid annually subject to the achievement of challenging performance targets.
Performance conditions The Committee may, at its discretion, award bonuses in respect of a financial year subject to performance conditions, the aim of which is to link the size of bonuses paid to financial growth of the Group over that financial year.
No bonus will be payable unless the following conditions are satisfied: i Increase in net asset value net asset value at the end of the financial year exceeds net asset value at the beginning of the financial year: ii Absolute performance of the portfolio ungeared total return the percentage increase in the total return on property assets of the Group over the financial year the Performance Period is greater than the percentage increase achieved by the portfolio ranked nearest to three-quarters up the performance table taken in ascending order of return the Upper Quartile of the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment Property Databank at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period and compounded monthly during the Performance Period the IPD Total Return Benchmark : and, iii Performance of the net asset value per share the percentage increase in net asset value per share for the Performance Period must be greater than the percentage increase achieved by the Upper Quartile of the portfolios of all quarterly valued funds measured by the Investment Property Databank at the beginning of the relevant Performance Period and compounded monthly during the Performance Period the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark.
The Committee will recommend the size of the bonus payable by reference to the same sliding scale based on the amount by which the increase in net asset value per share exceeds the increase in the Upper Quartile of the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark subject to a cap.
Calculation of amounts payable The total amount of the bonuses payable in any one year shall be determined by: calculating the difference between the percentage increase in net asset value per share for the Performance Period and the percentage increase in the Upper Quartile of the IPD Capital Growth Benchmark over the same period the Difference : and, calculating the sum of the amounts payable in relation to each 1% of the Difference on the following basis: Amount of Difference % of base net asset value payable Less than 1% 0.01 1% to less than 2% 0.02 And thereafter for every additional 1% An increment of 0.01 For example: From 4% to less than 5% 0.05 If the net asset value at the end of a financial year is less than the net asset value at the beginning of that year, the bonus payable for any subsequent year will be calculated by reference to the highest net asset value in the preceding years.
Financial accounts The audited financial accounts which record the financial performance on which the Plan operates will be those accounts prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
2006 Plan and individual limits The total amount payable under the 2006 Plan in any one year is limited to 4m.
An individual employees participation in the 2006 Plan is limited so that the bonus which may be paid to him under the 2006 Plan will not exceed 2m per annum.
There is a further limit that payments under the 2006 Plan in any year may not exceed 20% of the Groups pre-tax profits and payments under the 2006 Plan.
Among other constraints the Committee could restrict the bonuses if payment would affect the financial or trading position of the Company.
Timing of bonuses Bonuses will ordinarily be paid, subject to the performance conditions being satisfied, and provided that the participant remains a director or employee of the Group at the time of payment on a specified bonus date, which will fall within four months of the end of the relevant Performance Period.
Bonuses are not transferable, nor will benefits obtained under the 2006 Plan be pensionable.
Termination of employment If a participant dies, the bonus that would have been paid for the relevant financial year may, at the discretion of the Committee, be paid to the participants personal representatives, but will be scaled down pro rata to reflect the period elapsed since the start of the Performance Period.
If a participants employment ends in any other circumstances prior to the payment of the bonus, no entitlement will arise.
Change of control In the event of a change in control of the Group, bonuses in respect of the financial year in which the change of control falls may be paid to the extent that the relevant performance target s have been satisfied over an adjusted Performance Period.
Termination of the 2006 Plan The Committee will not recommend the making of bonuses under the 2006 Plan in connection with a financial year later than the year ended 31 March 2011 without further shareholder authority.

33 Helical Bar plc Report & Accounts 2007 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report In order to compensate option holders for the payment of the special dividend in April 2002, the Company pays a cash bonus of 20p per share on the date option holders exercise their options, as noted on page 35.
The gain on exercise of share options of the directors includes cash bonuses of 754,000 arising out of the exercise of options during the year.
The cost of these cash bonuses is included in administrative expenses.
Directors fees Fees receivable by Nigel McNair Scott in his capacity as Chairman of Avocet Mining Plc are shown in the financial statements of that Company.
Share options The Company operated three share option schemes during the year.
The Senior Executive 1988 Share Option Scheme ceased to be able to grant options over new shares subscription shares and shares held by the Helical Bar Share Ownership Plan Trust purchase shares in June 2001.
Under this scheme options only vest if the increase in the net asset value per share is greater than that achieved by the upper quartile of the Investment Property Databank index for capital growth of all funds over a five year period.
All the performance criteria of the options granted under the terms of this scheme have been met and option holders have now exercised all remaining options.
The Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme operates in respect of the grant of share options which exceed the Inland Revenue limit of 30,000.
Under this scheme the aggregate market value of shares issued or issuable to an individual under this and other option schemes may not exceed eight times his annual earnings.
Remaining share options granted in respect of this scheme are included in note 26.
The Helical Bar 1999 Approved Share Option Scheme is an Inland Revenue approved scheme.
Under the terms of this scheme options up to a maximum value of 30,000 per individual may be granted.
The performance criteria of the two 1999 schemes require total shareholder return over a set period to exceed a certain percentile of the aggregate performance of companies in the Real Estate Sector Index of the FTSE All-Share Index.
For the approved scheme the relevant period is three years and the 50th percentile.
For the unapproved scheme the relevant period is five years and 25th percentile.
These share option schemes have been replaced by the Performance Share Plan, details of which are included on pages 36 and 37, and future share option grants will only be made in exceptional circumstances and only following consultation with principal shareholders on the key terms of those options.
The directors interests in the share option schemes during the year were as follows: Profit if options Options Date from exercised at At start exercised At end Exercise which Expiry 31 March Type of year in year of year price exercisable date 2007 Michael Slade Senior Executive 1988 Share Option Scheme Purchase 30,000 30,000 Senior Executive 1988 Share Option Scheme Purchase 2,000,000 2,000,000 Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme Subscription 966,105 966,105 88.5p 08.03.04 07.03.09 3,292,003 Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme Purchase 740,000 740,000 150.0p 18.12.05 17.12.10 Helical Bar Approved 1999 Share Option Scheme Subscription 33,895 33,895 88.5p 08.03.02 07.03.09 115,497 3,770,000 2,030,000 1,740,000 3,407,500 Nigel McNair Scott Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme Purchase 215,000 215,000 Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme Subscription 1,176,105 808,335 367,770 88.5p 08.03.04 07.03.09 1,253,176 Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme Purchase 360,000 360,000 150.0p 18.12.05 17.12.10 Helical Bar Approved 1999 Share Option Scheme Subscription 33,895 33,895 88.5p 08.03.02 07.03.09 115,497 1,785,000 1,023,335 761,665 1,368,673 Performance conditions not satisfied at 31 March 2007.

Exercise of share options In order that the dilutive effect of issuing new shares be reduced, and to reduce the number of shares required by the ESOP to satisfy share awards, the Company agreed with employees that the number of shares required on the exercise of options be reduced.
To ensure that employees were not disadvantaged by this reduction, the exercise prices applied on the exercise of the options were correspondingly reduced.
In accordance with this agreement, the options exercised during the year by the directors, were as follows: Original Reduced Original Reduced Date of Type of number of number of exercise exercise Sale Gain Director exercise option shares shares price price price 000s Michael Slade 04.12.06 Purchase 30,000 24,005 90.5p 1.0p 450.0p 114 Michael Slade 04.12.06 Purchase 1,000,000 749,930 113.0p 1.0p 450.0p 3,561 Michael Slade 21.12.06 Purchase 1,000,000 770,500 113.0p 1.0p 490.0p 3,960 Nigel McNair Scott 04.12.06 Subscription 285,000 229,320 88.5p 1.0p 450.0p 1,085 Nigel McNair Scott 04.12.06 Purchase 215,000 172,995 88.5p 1.0p 450.0p 818 Nigel McNair Scott 21.12.06 Subscription 523,335 429,500 88.5p 1.0p 490.0p 2,201 Gerald Kaye 30.06.06 Subscription 250,000 190,966 88.5p 1.0p 375.0p 764 Michael Brown 30.06.06 Subscription 466,105 356,041 88.5p 1.0p 375.0p 1,425 The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2007 was 429p 2006: 395p.
This market price varied between 337p and 510p during the year.
The gain on exercise of share options includes a cash bonus of 20p per 1p share in accordance with the matter referred to under special dividend below.
Special dividend In order to compensate option holders for the payment of a special dividend or a distribution of capital, the Board has, under the terms of the Senior Executive 1988 Share Option Scheme and the Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme the Schemes, the authority to adjust the number of shares subject to option or the exercise price of those options.
35 Helical Bar plc Report & Accounts 2007 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report The Company is currently unable to increase the number of shares under option in sufficient quantity to satisfy the requirement to compensate option holders for the special dividend of 100p paid in April 2002.
An adjustment to the exercise price of the existing options would result in an increased national insurance cost to the Company.
Accordingly, the Board has considered alternative ways of compensating option holders and, as a result, the Company will compensate holders of options at the time the special dividend was declared, on the dates they exercise their options by 20p per 1p share previously 100p per 5p share, equivalent to the special dividend.
In the year under review compensation of 793,888 was paid following the exercise of options over 3,969,440 1p shares.
Performance Share Plan At the 2004 Annual General Meeting the Company received approval for the adoption of a Performance Share Plan PSP.
General The operation of the PSP is supervised by the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
The PSP is capable of delivering shares to an executive after a period of not less than three years, other than in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the Committee, subject to meeting pre-specified performance targets.
Eligibility All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries including directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their working time to the business of the Group who are not under notice nor within six months of any contractual retirement ages will be eligible to receive invitations to participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Grant of awards Awards may be made within the six weeks following approval at a general meeting, the announcement by the Company of its results for any period, or the removal of any statutory or regulatory restriction which had previously prevented an award being granted or any other times considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional.
No awards may be made more than ten years after the adoption of the PSP by the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will formally review the operation of the PSP after no more than five years.
An award consists of the right to acquire shares in the Company for either no payment or payment of a nominal sum.
Awards are neither transferable nor pensionable.
Limit on individual participation No awards may be granted over shares in any financial year whose value is greater than three times an employees annual rate of salary.
Exercise of awards Other than in exceptional circumstances, an award will vest no earlier than the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Group.
Once exercisable, awards will then remain capable of exercise for a period of normally no more than six months.
The Remuneration Committee has set demanding performance conditions for the vesting of shares.
There are two performance conditions, one based on absolute growth in the Companys net asset value per share and the other based on the gross total property return per share relative to other property funds as determined by IPD but excluding those funds worth less than 50m at the start of the three year period.
Performance will be measured over the three years following grant.
Participants will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through the PSP, other than to meet taxation and national insurance contributions liabilities, until they own shares to the value of 2 x salary for directors and 1 x salary for other executives.
For the growth in net asset value, the fully diluted triple net net asset value as at the start of the financial year in which a grant takes place will be compared to the value three years later having added back dividends.
a Absolute net asset value per share having added back dividends condition Annual compound increase after three years % of award vesting 15% p. a. or more 66.7 Between 7.5% p. a. and 15% p. a.
Zero If UK inflation RPI is higher than 3% per annum over the three year period then the required compound increases will be raised by the excess over the 3% per annum average.
b Total property return v IPD property funds condition Ranking after three years % of award vesting Upper quartile or above 33.3 Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3 Median 3.3 Less than median Zero Provided the net asset value per share having added back dividends increases over the three year period.
36 Helical Bar plc Report & Accounts 2007 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report Alignment with shareholders interests The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be made by executives directors and those below Board level through the PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place.
It has concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Company measured as the increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as dividends to shareholders that could accrue to all executives through the Companys long and short-term incentive and bonus plans excluding gains on share options granted before December 2002 at the point at which the maximum awards vest might be of the order of 20%.
At this point, in absolute terms, the Company will have increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Companys relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, over the three year period.
Share awards will be cancelled where the gross return falls below the IPD median and where the growth in triple net asset value is below 7.5% per annum over the three year period.
Relationship to the Companys share option schemes The PSP has replaced future share option grants which will only be made in exceptional circumstances and only following consultation with principal shareholders on the key terms of those options.
Awards made to directors under the terms of the PSP are as follows: Shares Shares Shares awarded awarded awarded Director 18.08.04 06.07.05 04.07.06 Total Michael Slade 750,000 519,855 391,304 1,661,159 Nigel McNair Scott 375,000 324,910 244,565 944,475 Gerald Kaye 375,000 279,420 210,326 864,746 Michael Brown 375,000 279,420 210,326 864,746 Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan On 24 July 2002 the shareholders approved the Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan the Plan.
Under the terms of this Plan employees of the Company are given up to 3,000 of free shares in any tax year.
Participants in the Plan may purchase additional shares up to a value of 1,500 which is matched in a ratio of 2:1 by the Company.
Provided participants remain employed by the Company for a minimum of three years they will retain the free and matching shares.
