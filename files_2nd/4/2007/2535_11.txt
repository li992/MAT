In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, a resolution will be submitted to the AGM to approve the Directors Remuneration Report.

The Committee meets not less than three times a year and has responsibility for: i making recommendations to the Board on the Groups policy on the remuneration of the Companys Chief Executive, Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee: ii the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of the remuneration of the Chairman and of specic remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, including pension rights, any compensation payments and benets: and iii the determination of awards under the Companys employee share plans to the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee.

From time to time the Company is also advised by Towers Perrin on remuneration-related issues.
The following individuals also provide material advice or services to the Committee during the year: Paul Moody Chief Executive.

Remuneration policy The remuneration policy with respect to Executive Directors has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to UK-listed companies of similar size and scope.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objectives, the remuneration of Executive Directors should comprise a balance between xed and variable performance-related pay elements with the predominant proportion of potential reward being linked to performance.
As a result, for superior performance, approximately two thirds of total remuneration is performance-related.
For target performance, approximately 53% of total remuneration is performance-related.
The Committee constantly reviews remuneration policy to ensure that it is sufciently exible to take account of future changes in Britvics business operations and environment and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholder interests.
Consequently, the policy set out in this report has applied during 2006 7 and will apply in 2007 8.
Remuneration objectives The principal objective of the policy is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration, including incentive arrangements, which will reward successful execution of the Companys short-term and long-term strategy.
The Committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries and incentive levels for the sector, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth aspirations of the Company.

Relative total shareholder return TSR over a three year performance period against a peer group of 20 similar sector companies.
Remuneration in practice Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually to take account of market movement, individual contribution and increases elsewhere in the Company.
Directors salaries are benchmarked against a selected peer group of UK companies with similar levels of revenue.
The salaries of other members of the Executive Committee are benchmarked against a selected group of major companies in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods FMCG and Retail sectors, where the Committee sees the primary market for talent at this level.
Short-Term Incentive Plan Targets are approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year and are aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives for 2006 7.
Up to 60% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Finance Director is payable for the achievement of target PBT, Net Revenue growth and cash ow performance on a 50% 25% 25% basis.
Up to a maximum of 120% and 100% of salary is payable for the achievement of exceptional performance targets for the Chief Executive and Finance Director respectively.
For 2006 7, a bonus of 102% of salary for the Chief Executive and 85% of salary for the Finance Director was earned for maximum performance against PBT and cash ow but just below target performance in Net Revenue growth.
Details of PBT and Net Revenue are shown on page 41 and cash ow on page 43.
For 2007 8 the Committee decided that the same structure as applied in 2006 7 should continue.
Target bonuses will be paid for achievement of performance measures based on PBT, Net Revenue growth and cash ow set at appropriately stretching levels.
The target and maximum incentive opportunities will also remain the same.
Executive Share Option Plan Annual grants of options are made at the discretion of the Board over shares in Britvic plc at the market price at date of grant to senior executives 24 in 2006 7.
The level of option grant and the performance conditions are determined and reviewed by the Committee annually.
For 2006 7 and thereafter the current policy is to grant the options over shares worth 200% and 150% of annual salary to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
A performance condition is applied such that 40% of the grant vests for the achievement of EPS growth over the three-year performance period equivalent to RPI 3% per annum.
No awards will vest below this threshold level of performance.
For achievement of EPS growth equivalent to RPI 7% per annum over the same period, 100% of the grant will vest, with straightline vesting between threshold and maximum.
Options lapse to the extent that the performance condition is not achieved.

Performance Share Plan Annual grants of performance shares are made at the discretion of the Board to senior executives and managers 77 in 2006 7.
The awards normally vest at the end of the three-year performance period, to the extent that the performance condition will have been achieved, and lapse to the extent it is not achieved.
For 2006 7 and thereafter the current policy is to grant the equivalent of 50% of annual salary to Executive Directors, calculated on the basis of the market price at the date of grant.
For awards to vest in full under this plan, Britvics TSR must rank in the top quartile of the peer group of the following 20 similar sector companies over the same period: AG BARR Nichols Associated British Foods Northern Foods C&C Group Premier Foods Cadbury Schweppes Reckitt Benckiser Dairy Crest SABMiller Diageo Scottish & Newcastle Fuller Smith Smith & Nephew Greene King SSL International IAWS Group Tate & Lyle Marstons formerly Wolverhampton & Dudley Uniq No awards will vest for performance below median, with 40% of the award vesting at median rising to 100% at upper quartile on a straight-line basis.
For 2007 8, it is proposed that the same peer group of companies will be used.
During 2006 7 two companies on the original list of comparator companies RHM and Arla Foods were taken over and subsequently excluded from the list.
The Committee considered whether to replace these two companies in order to protect against volatility and decided that the remaining 20 companies are sufficient for this purpose.
The Committee will keep the comparator companies under review.
Shareholding guidelines In accordance with best practice and further to align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, a shareholding guideline is in place.
The guideline requires Executive Directors to acquire a shareholding equal to their annual salary within five years from IPO calculated at the IPO share price.
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares other than to finance the cost of exercising options and any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of long-term incentives plans, unless approved by the Committee, for example, in cases of financial hardship.
Retirement benets The Executive Directors currently participate in the dened benefit section of the Britvic Pension Plan the Plan.
This broadly provides a pension of two thirds of final salary along with life assurance, ill health and dependants pensions.
The retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Bonus payouts and other incentive awards are not pensionable.
The Executive Directors also currently participate in the Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme, the Companys unfunded supplementary retirement benets scheme.
Prior to the legislative changes on 6 April 2006 A-Day, the Top Up Scheme provided pension benets above the previous HM Revenue & Customs HMRC earnings cap to which the Plan was subject.
Post A-Day, this earnings cap has been removed for future service within the Plan.
For pre A-Day service the earnings cap is maintained within the Plan and will be indexed by ination in line with Treasury notication.
The Top Up Scheme is maintained to provide pension benets above the earnings cap for pre A-Day service and to provide benets above the new lifetime allowance for post A-Day service.
The dened benefit section of the Plan is closed to new entrants.
All new entrants are offered membership of the dened contribution section of the Plan with similar life assurance, ill health and dependents pensions.
In accordance with the Committees terms of reference, it will, in 2007 8, undertake a strategic review of pension policy in respect of the Executive Directors.
