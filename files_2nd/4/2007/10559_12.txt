REMUNERA REMUNERATION REPORT TION REPORT The Directors Remuneration report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 18 April 2008.
The report has been drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
During the year the members of the Committee were: Simon Heale Chairman of the Committee : Joe MacHale: Martin Flower: Tim Stevenson: and, from December 2007, Andrew Given.
Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board as independent.
Tim Stevenson was independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman to the Board.
The Committee met on six occasions during the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources attend meetings of the Committee by invitation.
No executive Director or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is under consideration.
Deloitte and Touche LLP Deloitte was appointed by the Committee as its retained advisers in February 2007 and has provided advice on market practice and remuneration policy.
During the financial year, Deloitte has also provided unrelated tax and corporate finance services to the Company.
During the year, the Committee also sought advice from Imbucon and Watson Wyatt.
Imbucon provided Total Shareholder Return TSR analysis relating to the Companys share plans and Watson Wyatt provided remuneration consulting services.
Imbucon and Watson Wyatt did not provide any other services to the Company.
Additionally, the Committee had access to advice from the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Company Secretary, and the Director of Human Resources.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully and to create value for shareholders.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance related and based on the achievement of measurable targets which are relevant to and support the business strategy.
This is in order to create a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure that remuneration packages for executive Directors are competitive against the market in which we compete for talent.
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: the size of the company e. g. market capitalisation, turnover and number of people employed : the diversity and complexity of its businesses: and the geographical spread of its businesses.
During the year the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the current incentive arrangements in order to ensure that our executive remuneration policy and practices continue to support the business.
As a result of this review the following changes were made during 2007:  In order to provide a more relevant measure of our performance, the conditions for the 2007 LTIP awards were amended from TSR against the FTSE 350 to TSR against a tailored comparator group and EPS growth.
 No awards were made under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
 Shareholding guidelines have been introduced for executive Directors.
It is intended that the revised remuneration structures will continue to apply in 2008.
In addition, shareholder approval is being sought for the introduction of a new incentive plan, the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan, under which participants may voluntarily defer some of their bonus and earn matching shares based on Group performance.
Further details of this plan and the other components of our remuneration structures are set out on pages 51 and 52.

REMUNERATION REPORT THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC 51 Base salary The basic salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and having regard to practice in companies of comparable size and complexity in the FTSE 350.
Salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis.
During 2007, the Committee agreed to change the review date of base salaries from July to January.
As a transitional year, an adjustment was made to salaries in July 2007, with new salaries agreed for January 2008 as set out below.
At the time of their appointment to their current positions on the Board, the salaries of Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield were deliberately set at the conservative end of market practice.
To reflect their time in role and performance during the year, the Committee agreed that these should be adjusted to market competitive levels.
The current base salaries for executive Directors are as follows:  Mark Robertshaw 440,000 effective from January 2008  Kevin Dangerfield 255,000 effective from January 2008 The next salary review will take place in January 2009.
Base salary is the only element of the remuneration package that is pensionable.
Annual bonus The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the Company.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets and fostering the continued development of inter-divisional co-operation and collaboration.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity for executive Directors to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary if stretching performance targets are achieved.
Of this, 90% relates to financial targets and 10% relates to the achievement of personal objectives.
For 2007, the financial element for executive Directors and senior executives with Group responsibilities was based on underlying operating profit performance up to 80% of salary and operating cash flow up to 10% of salary.
For the executive Director and senior executives with Divisional responsibilities the financial criteria were tailored to each Division and included both underlying profit performance and working capital criteria up to 70% and 20% of salary respectively for Mark Lejman.
The 10% for the achievement of personal objectives applies to all participants.
The same bonus targets will apply for 2008.
The Committee has the discretion to vary the awards made based on an assessment of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
The bonus targets set for 2007, which were considered to be very stretching, have been substantially met and therefore the bonus awarded to executive Directors who served during the year was as follows: Mark Robertshaw 100% of salary 100% in 2006 Kevin Dangerfield 98% of salary 100% in 2006 Mark Lejman 20.9% of salary 83.5% in 2006 Subject to shareholder approval of the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan at the 2008 AGM, up to 50% of this annual bonus for Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield may, before entitlement, be deferred into an award over a number of ordinary shares determined in accordance with the plan.
Entitlement to the relevant proportion of bonus is conditional on such determination.
Long-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, details of which are set out below.
Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan Shareholder approval is currently being sought for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan, which will operate alongside the existing incentive arrangements.
The proposed new plan, in which executive Directors and senior executives will be eligible to participate, offers participants the opportunity to ordinarily defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares.
Participants must hold the deferral shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award.
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that stretching EPS targets have been met.
EPS will be adjusted for tax and other special items in order to provide a fair measure of underlying operating performance.
The performance conditions for the first awards under the plan are as follows: EPS performance Matching shares RPI 15% pa 3x match RPI 10% pa 1.75x match RPI 7.5% pa 1x match RPI 5% pa 0.5x match RPI 4% pa 0.25x match RPI 4% pa 0x match There will be straight-line vesting in between each point above.
Further details of the plan are provided in the shareholder circular to be sent to shareholders in March 2008.
52 THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC REMUNERATION REPORT Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance.
The scheme allows awards of up to 150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
The vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the award is made.
For awards made prior to 2007, the performance measures were based on the companys Total Shareholder Return TSR against the FTSE 350.
30% of the awards vest for achieving median ranked performance with full vesting for upper quartile ranked performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line pro rata basis.
During the year the Committee reviewed the targets for the LTIP and determined that these be amended such that 50% of awards are based on TSR against a tailored comparator group and 50% based on EPS growth adjusted for tax and other special items in order to provide a fair measure of underlying operating performance.
These conditions are considered to provide a closer alignment of reward with the Companys business strategy going forwards.
These targets applied to awards made in 2007 and will apply for awards to be made in 2008.
The vesting schedule for the awards is as follows: % of the Award which vests TSR performance against the sector comparator group Upper quartile ranked performance 50% Median ranked performance 15% Below median ranked performance 0% % of the Award which vests EPS growth RPI 10% pa 50% RPI 4% pa 15% RPI 4 % pa 0% Straight-line vesting applies between each point for both vesting schedules.
The Committee must also be satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting.
The TSR comparator group for the 2007 and 2008 LTIP awards are set out in the table below: Company Company Bodycote International Meggitt Charter Rotork Chemring Group Senior Cobham Spectris Cookson Group Spirax-Sarco FKI Tomkins Foseco TT Electronics Halma Ultra Electronics IMI Weir Group Laird Group 2007 comparator group only During the year, an award of 80,000 shares was made to each of Mark Lejman and Kevin Dangerfield.
In recognition of the one-off option award made on his appointment to CEO in 2006, Mark Robertshaw did not receive an LTIP award during 2007.
REMUNERATION REPORT THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC 53 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS was also approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive options granted at the market price of the Companys shares at the time of the grant.
Option awards are subject to a performance measure based on the comparative TSR performance of the Company measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the option is granted.
TSR is measured against a comparator group comprising the FTSE 350 at the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR performance places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of the options will be exercisable, with 100% of the options being exercisable for upper quartile performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile, options are exercisable on a straight-line pro rata basis.
The Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting is justified by the Companys underlying financial performance over the period.
No awards were made under the ESOS in 2007 and there is currently no intention to make awards under the option plan in 2008.
The details of Options and Awards held by all Directors are shown on page 58.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE As UK employees, the executive Directors may participate in the Savings-related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other eligible employees and subject to UK legislation.
Scheme members save a fixed amount per month over three years and options have been granted with an exercise price at 80% of the market price at the date of grant.
Those Directors who received options under this scheme are shown in the table on page 59.
No performance conditions apply to those options as they are a tax-efficient mechanism for all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
Other benefits Executive Directors are eligible to receive certain benefits including a cash allowance in lieu of a company car, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and other expenses.
Shareholding guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines were introduced for executive Directors and senior executives during the year.
Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary.
This policy will be supported with the introduction of the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan under which participants are encouraged to invest a proportion of their bonus into company shares.
Chairman and non-executive Directors Tim Stevenson was appointed as Chairman on 1 December 2006 and during the year he received an annual fee of 125,000.
Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee of 40,000.
Additional payments of 4,500 per annum are made to the Senior Independent Director, 7,500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 5,000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors are also entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board, strategy and other meetings.
No changes were made to non-executive fees during the year.
The next review will take place in 2008.
None of the non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company although they do have letters of appointment which contain no obligations relating to any notice period.
There are no obligations on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice to any non-executive Director.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the incentive, share or share option plans.
Each of the non-executive Directors is subject to re-election by shareholders every third year after their initial confirmation by shareholders as a Director.
Should any non-executive Director serve for nine years or more they would be subject to annual re-election.
54 THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC REMUNERATION REPORT Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to 12 months notice at any time.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the Director concerned.
Contracts end on each Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year.
Executive Director Date of contract Kevin Dangerfield 3 August 2006 Mark Robertshaw 4 August 2006 Mark Lejman resigned 2 January 2008 1 March 2004 Mark Robertshaws service contract contains specific termination provisions such that the Company may terminate his contract by making a payment in lieu of notice to include basic salary, pension contribution, car allowance and, at the Committees discretion, bonus for the period of the notice.

Mark Lejman resigned from the Board on 2 January 2008.
The figures shown under Other payments comprise those payments detailed on page 55.
Andrew Given was appointed on 7 December 2007.
178,097 of the Other payments made to Warren Knowlton in 2007 relate to the reimbursement by the Company to Warren Knowlton of US employer social security costs and other payments made by him in 2007 to the US Internal Revenue Service in respect of his time with the Company.
Warren Knowltons liability to make such payments resulted from a change in his tax domicile in December 2005.
The social security liability discharged by him was properly an employer cost and there was therefore no benefit to him resulting from this payment.
The balancing figure of 11,771 relates to the cost of providing professional tax advice to Warren Knowlton and healthcare costs both in accordance with the Companys agreement with him on his retirement.
This refers to an award made to Mark Robertshaw following his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in August 2006.
The award is structured as a market value option over 1,000,000 shares subject to the performance conditions that apply to awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
