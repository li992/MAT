Performance Share Plan The Southern Cross Healthcare Group 2006 Performance Share Plan the PSP was adopted by the Company in June 2006.
Awards under the PSP are on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 100% of annual basic salary as at the award date, unless the Remuneration Committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist in relation to the recruitment or retention of an employee, in which case the limit will be 200% of annual basic salary.
On 4 September 2006, 2,365,332 awards were granted with an exercise price of Nil.
A summary of the vesting conditions is included below.
Vesting of awards made under the PSP takes place at the expiry of the three-year period of the plan and is subject to attainment of agreed performance targets which will be tested at 28 September 2008.
70% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Earnings Per Share EPS.
For the purposes of calculating the EPS condition, net income is defined as profit after taxation before deduction of future minimum rental increases, goodwill impairment, annual bonuses paid to participants in the PSP and the cost of share options charged to the income statement under the PSP.
The remaining 30% will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Total Shareholder Return TSR.
In respect of 70% of the award subject to the EPS performance target, 100% of this will vest if the PSP EPS for the 2008 financial period exceeds 23.13p per share and no awards will vest if PSP EPS is below 18.61p per share, with straight-line vesting between these two points.
The remaining 30% of the award will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
100% of this will vest if the Companys TSR growth is in the upper quartile and 40% will vest if growth is at the median, with straight-line vesting between the two points.
If the Companys growth is below the median then no awards shall vest.
For any new award, the percentage of the TSR award element that will vest at median performance is 33%.
