Remuneration for 2007 The following sections provide information on payments, outstanding conditional incentive awards and shares released in 2007 for each executive director.
2007 Annual Incentive Plan structures Annual bonus awards for all executive directors are determined by the Companys financial performance and the contribution of the individual.
Greater weighting is given to the financial measures.
The balance between the Group and business unit measures reflect the Committees view for each executive director on the structure required to ensure the appropriate focus.
The table below sets out the weightings between the Group and Business Unit measures and personal performance.
Financial measures Personal performance Group Business Philip Broadley 80% 20% Clark Manning 25% 65% 10% Michael McLintock 10% 75% 15% Nick Prettejohn 20% 60% 20% Barry Stowe 20% 60% 20% Mark Tucker 80% 20% The proportions for Clark Manning relate to his participation in the annual bonus plan and the Jackson Bonus pool which is based on Jackson financial performance.
The proportions shown in the table incorporate a notional level for this pool.
Annual Incentive Plans Performance in 2007 The main business measures considered by the Remuneration Committee and incorporated into the annual incentive plans are IFRS profit, EEV profit and cash flow.
The measures for Jackson are different and are identified later in this section.
The 2007 results under the main business measures were: Group UK Asia M&G notes 2,3 notes 2,4 note 5 IFRS profit from continuing operations 1,213m 528m 246m 254m EEV profit from long-term business 2,532m 859m 1,046m Net cash flow -82m -142m 37m Comparing these with the 2006 results, using constant exchange rates, produces the results set out in the following table.
Group UK Asia M&G IFRS profit from continuing operations Increase Increase Increase Increase of 20% of 6% of 17% of 25% EEV profit from long-term business Increase Increase Increase of 25% of 25% of 34% Net cash flow 22m 30m 9m improvement improvement improvement Increase Increase Increase of 21% of 17% 32% Notes 1 The 2007 and 2006 profit figures based on reported actual exchange rates were audited by KPMG.
Net cash flow and the conversions at constant exchange rates are not audited.
2 In considering the bonus payments to be made to the executive directors the Committee decided to exclude the effects of Egg such that IFRS profits are from continuing operations.
Hence no income from the sale of Egg or operating losses pre-sale are included.
3 2007 Group performance against the metrics included in the executive directors annual incentive plans was above maximum.
4 UK Net cash flow excludes the With-profits transfer.
5 Michael McLintocks annual bonus plan performance measures include, as well as IFRS profits, growth in retail funds under management and comparative fund investment performance.
Performance achieved against IFRS profits was above superior performance and the other two measures were around upper quartile performance.
6 2007 performance of the metrics in the individual business incentive plans were generally significantly above expectation, although Asia results included outcomes between threshold and business plan and a UK result close to business plan.
115 Directors remuneration report For year ended 31 December 2007 continued Clark Mannings annual plan includes free cash generated and the result was 21 per cent above business plan levels.
Clark Manning also participates in the Jackson Bonus pool which in 2007 was based principally on US GAAP profits up 26 per cent compared with 2006 and New Business EEV profits up 19 per cent compared with 2006.
For all the executive directors, individual strategic goals formed the objectives against which individual performance was assessed.
These included each executive directors contribution to the Group strategy as a member of the Prudential plc Board and the proper performance of their functional and or business unit roles.
The Committee is fully satisfied that it has considered each case carefully, applied appropriate judgement and that the bonus award has been made for each executive director taking into account the overall performance of the Company in 2007.

The maximum grant is made only if the TSR ranking of the Company is 20th percentile or above.
Between these points, the size of the grant made is calculated on a straight-line sliding scale.
In normal circumstances, directors may take up their right to receive shares at any time during the following seven years.
2007 Awards The awards made under the Group Performance Share Plan and the Business Unit Performance Plan in respect of 2007 have a performance period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009.
In determining the 2007 conditional share awards the shares were valued at their average share price during the preceding calendar year, and the price used to determine the number of shares was 614.91 pence.
Group Performance Share Plan Awards under the Group Performance Share Plan are described on page 105. Business Unit Performance Plan Awards under the Business Unit Performance Plan are described on page 106.
Notes Performance levels under current awards at 31 December 2007: Note Plan Award year Performance levels under current awards at 31 December 2007 1 Restricted Share Plan 2004 The ranking of the Companys TSR was ranked at 56th percentile at the end of the three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2006 and as a result the 2004 awards lapsed.
2 Restricted Share Plan 2005 The ranking of the Companys TSR at the end of the three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2007 was 30th out of the remaining 85 companies in the FTSE 100 35th percentile and as a result it is anticipated that options over 62.5 per cent of the maximum number of shares in each award will be made which would result in nil cost options over 114,365 shares for Philip Broadley, 102,095 shares for Clark Manning, 36,597 shares for Michael McLintock and 223,011 shares for Mark Tucker.
3 Group Performance Share Plan 2006 At 31 December 2007 Prudentials TSR performance was 121.4 per cent of the TSR performance of the index.

The award payout equals an initial award value adjusted by the change in the Prudential plc share price over the performance period.
In order for any award to be made under the 2005 plan, the growth rate over the performance period must be greater or equal to eight per cent compound growth per annum.
At this level of performance, the initial award value is US$864,240.
If the on-target performance level of 11.5 per cent per annum compound is achieved the initial award value is doubled.
If the annual growth rate is at least 17.5 per cent, the payout increases to a maximum of three times the initial award value.
For performance between these points, payouts are on a straight line sliding scale.
For the 2004 award the results led to a payment of US$4,028,896.
The face values of the awards for Clark Manning are converted at the average exchange rate for 2007 which was US$2.0015 1 2006: US$1.8430 1.
For the 2005 Business Cash LTIP, the compound annual growth rate in appraisal value was 22.8 per cent and as a result a payment of US$4,416,308 will be made.
Michael McLintock Michael McLintocks 2004, 2005 and 2006 cash long-term incentive awards were under the M&G Chief Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides a cash reward through phantom M&G share awards and options.
For these awards, the phantom share price at the beginning of the performance period was 1.
The change in the phantom share price equals the change in M&G profit, modified up or down by the investment performance of M&G, over the performance period.
For each year the face value of the share award was 225,000 and the phantom option award had a face value of 367,800.
Provided the phantom share options have value, they may be exercised in part or in full during annual exercise periods after three to seven years from the start of the performance period.
For the 2004 award the phantom share price at the end of the performance period was 2.59.
This resulted in a payment from the phantom share award of 582,750 and a phantom option award of 367,800 units.
Michael McLintock did not exercise any of these options.
For the 2005 award, the phantom share price at the end of the performance period was 2.34.
This will result in a payment of 526,500 from the share element of the award.
Under the rules of Michael McLintocks 2000 phantom option award, a payment of 402,741 was made at the end of the seven-year exercise period.
Following consultations with shareholders an award with a face value of 1,333,000 was made in 2007 under the share element of the M&G Chief Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Mark Norbom Mark Norboms awards under the Business Cash LTIP for 2004 vested as a result of Asias performance and a payment of 412,751 was made in 2007.
On the termination of his employment his award under the 2005 Business Cash LTIP lapsed.
119 Directors remuneration report For year ended 31 December 2007 continued Other share awards The table below sets out the share awards that have been made to executive directors under their appointment terms and those deferred from annual incentive plan payouts.
The values of the deferred share awards are included in the bonus and total figures in the directors remuneration table on page 114.
