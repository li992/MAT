Remuneration Committee the Committee : Composition, Responsibilities and Operation The names of the members of the Committee who served during the year ended 31 December 2007 are as follows: Mr N H Northridge Chairman Mr R V McGlone Mr D C M Hamill appointed 1 May 2007 Mr R J MacLeod appointed 10 September 2007 Mr A C Salvesen resigned from the Committee on 1 May 2007 The Committee has been entirely composed of Independent Non-executive Directors since 1 May 2007.
Mr A C Salvesen was not considered to be independent and stood down from the Committee on 1 May 2007.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as Shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no potential conicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day operational responsibility within the Group.
In exercising its responsibilities the Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, and consults with the Chairman and Group Chief Executive.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website at www.
com investors under the heading Corporate Governance.
The Committees principal function is to determine the policy on remuneration for the most senior executives of the Group and to approve the specic remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including their service contracts.
The Committee also has responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.
The Committees remit therefore includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, benets in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, Longterm Incentive Schemes, pension rights, and any compensation or termination payments.
There are a number of external advisors appointed by the Company who advise on remuneration matters for the wider workforce and also provide advice to the Committee from time to time.
Principal advisors in the year were as follows: Kepler Associates provided remuneration consultancy with respect to basic salary, bonus plans and executive Long-term Incentive Plans.
New Bridge Street Consultants provided advice on the implementation and administration of share plans.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting provided advice on retirement benets in the UK and overseas and administers the Groups UK dened benefit pension scheme.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy The Committee has adopted the following policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors throughout 2007.
It is intended that this policy will apply in 2008 and future years.
Annual Salaries Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the job.
The Company typically pays the market median, for standard performance in the job, and pays up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, reference is made to a number of well-established salary surveys covering similar jobs of the same size in a large sample of companies in the manufacturing and service sectors in the UK.
The same consistent approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate surveys for the geographical location.
The Companys pay systems are designed to allow progression that reects an individuals contribution to the business and to control overall cost.
Pay and benefit structures are designed to be cost effective to achieve the right level of attraction and retention at the best value.
The Company is always mindful of the need for good corporate governance in respect of pay and benets for all its employees including Directors.
Performance Related Elements of Remuneration A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related through an annual bonus plan as further explained below.
Annual Cash Bonuses The Company pays competitive bonuses that are intended to place the total cash earnings of executives at around the upper quartile for the market place in high performance years.
The factors to be measured for bonus purposes and the corresponding levels of bonus are pre-determined at the start of the year.
Bonuses are paid as close to the end of the performance period as practicable so that they reect current performance.
All Executive Directors participate in a scheme which allows them to earn bonuses on a graduated scale if a targeted level of earnings per share is exceeded.
The performance criteria are designed to enhance shareholder value and the Committee approves all financial targets and personal goals: no bonus will be paid if targets and goals are not achieved.
For the Group Chief Executive and the Finance Director, all of their bonus is based upon earnings per share.
50% of the bonus of Regional Directors is based upon the same measure with 50% based upon profit achieved in their own region.
The Group Chief Executive and the Director responsible for North America have a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of basic salary and the maximum for other Executive Directors is 75%.
The Committee does, however, also have discretion to reward outstanding individual achievement.
56 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Long-term Incentive Arrangements Long-term Incentive Arrangements LTIPs were introduced in 2004 consisting of a performance share plan and a co-investment plan which cover about 117 executives in the business worldwide.
The Committee utilises two performance measures: diluted earnings per share EPS and Return on Average Capital Employed ROCE as the indicators against which the LTIP programme is judged.
75% of awards are measured against EPS and 25% against ROCE.
The Committee considers that this mix of measures both of earnings and capital efficiency are appropriate to a business such as the Company.
Each year, the Committee reviews these targets and adjusts them in light of circumstances.
Performance Share Plan Under this plan, executives are granted a conditional award of shares, some, all or none of which will vest three years later, depending upon the Companys performance over the deferral period.
The measurement of performance commences in the year in which the award is made and awards are subject to the executive remaining in service at the end of the period.
For grants in years 2004-2007, the Committee decided that an appropriate range for real i. e. ination-adjusted compound annual growth in EPS was 3%-8%.
If ination averaged 2% per annum over the three year performance period, this would be the equivalent of headline growth in EPS of 5%-10%.
Targets for ROCE during this period were increased annually in each LTIP, and, in 2007, were between 20% and 23% per annum over the relevant three year performance period.
If the proposed changes to LTIP arrangements referred to on page 58 are approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the performance criteria for the 2008 plan would be for real compound annual growth in EPS over the three year performance period of 3%-10% for the base award and 13%-20% real compound annual growth in EPS for the super award.
The ROCE performance range would be between 23% and 25% per annum.
There would be no award against either EPS or ROCE for performance which does not meet the minimum targets.
Further details on the proposed plan changes are contained in Part B of the Appendix to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
The Committees intention is that the maximum award would be for shares with a value equal to one years salary at date of grant and that, in practice, only Executive Directors would receive awards at this level.
During 2007 Executive Directors were granted awards equivalent to between 70% and 100% of their basic salary.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 57 Remuneration Report continued Co-investment Plan Under this plan executives are currently allowed to invest up to a maximum of 20% of their base salary in Aggreko shares.
The offer will be made to them each year shortly after bonuses are declared.
This means that executives can use their net bonus to acquire shares at market price but there is no direct link to the bonus paid.
Provided that the executive continues to hold these shares for three years the Company will make a matching award.
There will be an automatic match of three shares for every four the executive holds i. e. a 75% match.
Higher levels of matching award will be dependent upon performance up to a maximum total matching award of six shares for every four the executive holds, i. e. a 150% match, if the maximum level of performance is achieved.
The performance measures and performance targets under this Co-investment Plan in 2008 are exactly the same measures as those which will apply under the Performance Share Plan, i. e. real compound growth in aggregate EPS in a range from 3% to 10% per annum on a straight line, pro-rata, basis and average ROCE of between 23% and 25% per annum.
Proposed Changes to Performance Share Plan and Co-investment Plan In the previous four years, the Companys revenues have almost doubled, and market capitalisation has tripled.
The Company is keen to ensure that management is incentivised to continue improving upon this success.
To that end, the Committee, in conjunction with its independent advisers, Kepler Associates, reviewed the Companys incentive arrangements.
Following this review, the Committee recommended to the Board changes to the Companys annual bonus scheme, which increase the annual bonus payable, for additional performance.
The Committee also recommended to the Board changes to the Aggreko Performance Share Plan 2004 and the Aggreko Co-investment Plan 2004, details of which are contained in Part B of the Appendix to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
The Committee believes the proposed changes further align executive and Shareholder interests, and provide additional incentive to deliver exceptional performance, while reducing total remuneration for median performance.
Sharesave Plans The Board believes that Sharesave schemes generally encourage the matching of interests between employees and shareholders.
The Aggreko Sharesave Plans are normally offered annually to all employees and Executive Directors who have at least six months service.
Executive Share Option Schemes Prior to 2004 senior executives were invited to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Following the implementation of the Performance Share and the Co-investment Plans, no further grants will be made under these existing Executive Share Option Schemes.
The allocation of Executive Share Options was based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the 1 seniority and job size of the individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
All executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the Group Income Statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3 per cent per annum, over a specified period, the option is capable of exercise.
For options granted after 25 April 2001, retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
For options granted before 25 April 2001, testing of the performance conditions is made with reference to EPS growth over three consecutive years prior to the date of exercise and TSR it is for the period from the date of grant to the date of exercise.
58 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Mr F A B Shepherd was eligible for an award under the Phantom Option Scheme on 25 September 2002.
This award was approved by the Committee in order to continue to incentivise Mr Shepherd at a time when he was no longer eligible to participate in Aggrekos Approved and Non-approved Executive Share Option Schemes.
These phantom options lapsed during 2007 having failed to achieve their performance conditions.
Retention of Shares by Executive Directors The Committee has adopted a policy that encourages Executive Directors to use the Long-term Incentive Plans and Executive Share Option Schemes to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company with the objective of further aligning their long-term interests with those of other Shareholders.
Under this policy, on vesting of share grants, Executive Directors, who are not within five years of their normal retirement age, should hold at least 50% of the net proceeds in shares until their aggregate holding is equivalent to at least 100% of their salary.
Other Benets Other benets, including pensions, are based on current market practice and take into account long-term trends in provision.
Further details on pension provision are set out on pages 62 and 63.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods All of the Executive Directors have service agreements that require one years notice of termination from the individual and one years notice of termination from the Company.
Mr F A B Shepherd has a service contract that expires on 1 May 2009 while other Directors have a normal retirement age of 60.
On early termination, Executive Directors are entitled to basic salary and benets for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination.
External Appointments Mr R C Soames served as a Non-executive Director of Baggeridge Brick PLC until February 2006.
He was permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to Nil during the year ended 31 December 2007 2006: 3,045.
On 13 July 2007 he joined the Board of Electrocomponents plc as a Nonexecutive Director and is permitted to retain earnings from this position: these earnings amounted to 18,667 for the year ended 31 December 2007 2006: Nil.
The Committee has allowed Mr A G Cockburn to serve as a Non-executive Director of Galiform Plc with effect from October 2006.
He is permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to 46,515 for the year ended 31 December 2007 2006: 8,484.
Remuneration of Chairman and Non-executive Directors The Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for the Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee recommends remuneration policy and level of fees for the Chairman to the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Chairman or Non-executive Director of the Company.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors in respect of service as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and as Senior Independent Director.
When setting these fees, reference is made to information provided by a number of remuneration surveys, the extent of the duties performed and the size of the Company.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, retirement benets or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.

The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year-ends.
The FTSE Mid 250 was selected as this general index is considered more appropriate than sector and peer group comparators given the unique nature of the Companys business.

Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 61 Remuneration Report continued With respect to 2007, performance targets were set for the bonus scheme at the start of the year and at that time the Company described 2007 to investors as a year in which a material increase in profits compared to 2006 was expected to be achieved.
In the event, strong trading results led to better than expected results.
Aggrekos diluted Earnings per Share pre-Exceptional Items rose by 51.1% from 19.87 pence to 30.02 pence, exceeding market expectations and the stretch performance targets set at the start of the year for the bonus plan.
This has resulted in both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director earning maximum bonus levels of 100% and 75% of salary respectively.
For the regional Executive Directors, 50% of their bonus was linked to profits generated by their region.
The Aggreko International and Europe regions exceeded their profit targets and as a result both regional Executive Directors earned the maximum bonus for 2007: no regional bonus was paid for North America.
Details of changes in basic salary and fees are set out in the table below.
All Directors salaries and fees are reviewed annually as at 1 July.

62 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Mr A G Cockburn joined the Company before 1 April 2002 and is a member of the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme which is a funded, dened-benefit scheme approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
The key elements of his benets are: a normal retirement age of 60: for service up to 31 December 2006, a benets accrual rate of 1 30th for each years service final salary is subject to the earnings cap for service to 5 April 2006 : for service after 1 January 2007 the accrual of benets will be on a career average basis at a rate of 1 30th for each years service: an employee contribution rate of 6% of basic salary from 1 January 2007 prior to this date the rate was 5% of basic salary : and a spouses pension on death.
Mr A G Cockburn was a member of the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme during 2007 and the following disclosure relates to his membership of the Scheme.

The accrued pensions are the amounts that would be paid at the anticipated retirement date if the Director left service as at 31 December 2007, with no allowance for increases in the period between leaving service and retirement.
Mr Cockburn is also entitled to a xed pension of 2,162 per annum payable from age 60 from the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme resulting from benets transferred in from the scheme of a previous employer.
This benefit is not included in the above disclosure.
The method used to calculate transfer values in the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme changed with effect from November 2007.
The previous basis was outdated in terms of the longevity and investment return assumptions.
The basis was therefore updated to ensure compliance with current actuarial guidance.
The application of new economic and longevity assumptions increased the transfer value of all pension scheme members by approximately 50%.
In order to calculate the increase in transfer value during 2007 net of contributions, the transfer value as at 31 December 2006 has been recalculated based on the post November 2007 method.
The transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2006 was previously calculated as 211,975.
Mr F A B Shepherd left the scheme on 31 December 2003 and took a transfer out of his accrued pension on 9 January 2004.
All Executive Directors who are members of a pension plan are provided with a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary.
Mr F A B Shepherd is provided with a lump sum death in service benefit of two times salary.
