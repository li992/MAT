Remuneration report Composition and Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating executive remuneration policy and for determining the remuneration of the executive directors and certain senior executives.
Its members are the non-executive directors as shown in Table 1, together with their attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee during 2006 07.
Remuneration Committee membership and attendance in 2006 07 1 June 25 July 23 November 29 March 1 Committee member 2006 2006 2006 2007 Mr R I Case Chairman Attended Attended Attended Attended 2 Mr R P Edey Attended Sir Michael Hodgkinson Attended Attended Attended Attended Mr C L Matthews Attended Attended Attended Mr D J Pearl Attended Attended Attended Attended Notes: 1 The meeting held on 25 July 2006 was a telephone meeting.
2 Mr Edey resigned his position as non-executive director on 1 August 2006.
All of the above served on the Remuneration Committee throughout the year, or as indicated, in Table 1.
All of the non-executive directors including the Company Chairman are considered by the Company to be independent.
The Company Chairman attended the Committee by invitation.
Mr Heiden is normally invited to attend meetings as an adviser to the Committee.
He was not present when his own remuneration was being determined.
During 2006 07 the Committee received information from Mercer Human Resources TSR monitoring, and Hewitt Associates remuneration policy and market data.
Hewitt also provided administration services to the Group pension scheme and plan.
Mr Heiden appointed Hewitt Associates as advisers in 2004 05.
Mercer Human Resources was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 1998.
During the year Hewitt Associates were formally appointed as advisers to the Committee.
Hewitt Associates continued to act as advisers to the Chief Executive.
Should conflict of interest arise for Hewitt in this dual advisory role, the Chief Executive will appoint his own alternative adviser.
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act, an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders approval for the Remuneration report will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Executive remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees objectives are to ensure that the Company is able to: attract, retain and motivate high calibre people: and align the interests of the executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders by rewarding executive directors and certain senior executives according to the overall performance of the individual businesses and Group.
The Group reviewed its remuneration policy in 2004 5 and introduced many best practices, particularly with regard to annual and long-term incentives.
The Groups remuneration policy is: setting base salaries at the appropriate market median: 50% of total remuneration to be variable, for on-target performance: a balance between short and long-term variable remuneration: 1 one-third of annual incentives paid as deferred shares that can be matched if an ROIC target is achieved: long-term incentives are a combination of option grants and or performance shares.
Under this policy, on-target performance is capable of delivering around 50% of total remuneration in the form of variable remuneration.
This is achieved through the annual performance related bonus scheme and long-term incentives.
1 ROIC is defined as operating profit adjusted for exceptional items divided by total capital invested in the business.
40 FKI plc Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually having regard to market practices for similar executive positions in a comparable group of companies mainly in the engineering sector and supported by information and advice from independent external consultants.
A median based salary policy was adopted in 2005 when it was considered that the former lower-quartile policy impaired the Companys ability to attract and retain high calibre executives.
For most roles the comparator group was the engineering and machinery sector.
However, for the roles of Chief Executive and Group Finance Director a broader range of comparators, including some outside of the engineering and machinery sector, are used to help determine competitive base salaries.
Comparative data and information was provided by Hewitt Associates.
Executive directors also receive additional taxable benefits, namely the provision of a fully expensed company car or an allowance in lieu thereof, medical insurance and disability insurance.
Performance appraisal The Company has a structured performance appraisal process for its executive directors and executive management.
The outcome from appraisal influences decisions on salary progression and helps to identify individual and collective training and development needs.
Annual performance-related bonus scheme The Company operates an annual performance-related bonus scheme for executive directors and other schemes for certain senior executives.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director participate in a bonus scheme based upon budgeted pre-tax profits of the Group.
Mr Gott, Group Engineering Director MD FKI Logistex participates in a scheme based partly upon budgeted pre-tax profit of the Group and partly on the profit and operating cash flow of FKI Logistex.
Other senior executives participate in a bonus scheme based upon business unit profit, operating cash flow and achievement of personal objectives, or Group profit and personal objectives.
For executive directors a performance related bonus of 25% of salary is payable for achieving a trigger point of Target profit less 10% budgeted operating profit, after interest but before exceptional items, amortisation and tax.
The bonus increases on a straight line pro rata basis from 25% to 50% for achieving between the trigger point and 100% of Target profit.
The bonus may increase further on a straight line pro rata basis from 50% to 100% for achieving 100% of Target profit plus 10% of budgeted operating profit.
Following approval by the Board of reasonable adjustments to Target profit, the Companys external auditors check that the calculation of bonuses for the executive directors adheres to the scheme rules governing such calculations.
The rules of the bonus scheme will be reviewed in 2007 to take account of the ABIs updated guidelines on executive remuneration policy and practice.
In 2006, one-third of post-tax cash bonus for executive directors was exchanged for deferred shares.
If the Companys level of ROIC reaches an average of 10% over the following three years the deferred shares will be matched one-forone.
Dividends are paid on deferred shares.
This plan is designed to align executive directors interests more closely with the long-term interests of shareholders and provides a mechanism that encourages executive directors to grow their personal shareholding in the Company.
A similar scheme exists for a small number of senior executives but with reduced levels of matching.
Executive directors are now encouraged to accumulate a shareholding of at least one times basic salary over a four year period.
41 FKI plc Remuneration report Long-term incentive plan Long-term incentives were provided through a combination of executive share options and performance shares.
Each element of the long-term incentive may vest independently of the other.
Executive directors can be awarded the equivalent of up to two times annual salary in options and up to one times annual salary in performance shares, determined on an individual basis by the Remuneration Committee.
Details of actual grants can be found in tables on pages 48 and 49.
Share options The practice is to grant options within a period of six weeks following the announcement of the Companys preliminary and or interim results.
The share option element is granted at the average price of FKI plc ordinary shares over five dealing days before the grant date and are normally required to be held for a minimum of three years before they are capable of exercise.
If options fail to vest at the third anniversary they lapse.
Options that vest at the third anniversary remain live until the tenth anniversary of granting.
Options vest against a level of Earnings Per Share EPS.
For grants made in 2006 no options vest for an EPS less than RPI 12% over the three-year measurement period.
For EPS at or greater than RPI 12%, options vest on a straight-line basis as illustrated in the table below.
Earnings per share growth is considered to be an appropriate measure of the Companys underlying performance, as it requires that there should be a demanding improvement in the Companys performance before scheme participants can benefit from an increase in the share price.
The assessment as to whether performance conditions have been met is calculated by the Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and independently verified by the Remuneration Committee, and, where appropriate, advice is obtained from an external independent firm of Chartered Accountants.
Earnings per share is defined as the Companys headline earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with the principles set out in the Statement of Investment Practice No.
1 The Definition of IIMR Headline Earnings issued by the Institute of Investment Management and Research.
IIMR Headline earnings are calculated by excluding from the reported results any income statement items of a non-trading or capital nature.
Option grants made in 2006 07 RPI EPS growth over a three year period Percentage of the option grant that vests Below RPI 12% Nil RPI 12% 25 RPI 15% 50 RPI 18% 75 RPI 21% 100 Performance shares Performance shares are held in trust for three years.
There are two performance conditions for each grant of performance shares.
Fifty per cent of a grant may vest against Total Shareholder Return TSR and the remaining 50% may vest against return on invested capital ROIC.
Performance shares that fail to vest at the third anniversary of grant automatically lapse.
Accrued dividends are paid on any performance shares that vest.
For performance shares linked to TSR, no shares vest for a TSR performance below the 50th percentile.
For a TSR performance at or above the 50th percentile performance shares vest on a straight line basis as illustrated in the table below: FKI plc TSR performance Percentage of the TSR-related performance shares that vest Below median Nil Equal to the median 30 Equal to or above the 80th percentile 100 42 FKI plc Remuneration report Long-term incentive plan continued For performance shares linked to ROIC, no shares vest for a three-year average ROIC of less than 8%.
For a three-year average ROIC performance above 8%, performance shares vest on a straight line basis as illustrated in the table below: Averaged ROIC over a three year performance period Percentage of the ROIC-related performance shares that vest Below 8% Nil At 8% 40 At 9% 60 At 10% 80 At 11% and above 100 Former long-term incentive plan All executive options granted from July 1996 onwards may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Groups growth in earnings per share, as defined above, must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to retesting in subsequent years from a rolling base.
Retesting was removed from the former executive option scheme for options granted after April 2004.
The level of vesting of awards under the former LTIP is determined by performance of the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR against a comparator group of all companies which on the date of grant are constituent companies of the former Engineering and Machinery sector as determined by the FTSE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee.
The graph below shows the Companys TSR performance compared with that of the comparator group.
No awards vest for below median performance and 50% of an award will vest for median performance.
Full vesting occurs only at upper quartile performance, and 75% of an award will vest for performance above the median but below upper quartile.
Accrued dividends on vested awards are paid to the executives pending transfer of the shares into the name of the respective participant.
The performance condition is Total Shareholder Return, as illustrated in the graph below, as this was considered to be the best means of aligning the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return.
A table giving full details of the directors options, LTIP shares and performances shares granted under the new and former plans and exercised during the year under review is shown on pages 48 and 49.

8 Foseco, Melrose and Stanelco were added to the FTSE engineering and machinery index in 2006 and so entered the peer group in 2006.
The assessment of whether or not the performance conditions have been met is independently calculated by Mercer Human Resources consulting in conjunction with Datastream and is ratified by the Remuneration Committee.
Inland Revenue Approved Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme This scheme was approved by shareholders in 1997 and was open to all UK employees who had completed six months service and who entered into an approved savings contract for a term of three or five years.
The maximum amount that could be saved was 250 per month, and the total savings including interest at the end of the term are available to purchase shares at 80% of their market value shortly before the start of the savings contract.
Executive directors could participate in this scheme on the same terms as all other employees.
No grants of SAYE options were made under the scheme during 2006 07.
Recruitment of new directors Executive directors The Nominations Committee review and approve a recruitment specification.
The Director of Group HR advises the Committee on availability of internal candidates.

A search firm may be engaged to assist with the recruitment process.
A shortlist of candidates is presented to the Chief Executive who interviews potential candidates, and refines the shortlist.
The Nominations Committee make the final selection and recommendation to the Board.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy that all executive directors have one-year rolling service contracts with a one-year notice period.
However, in order to attract high calibre recruits, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to offer newly recruited executive directors an initial two-year notice period which reduces to one year.
Save as listed below, there are no express provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of the executive directors contracts and at the date of termination, other than payments due during the notice period.
The standard terms within service agreements are being reviewed to ensure they are compliant with ABI revised guidelines published in December 2006.
In the case of Mr Heiden, in the event of termination of his service contract by an acquiring company after a change of control, there is provision in his service contract for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to one years pay and contractual benefits without deduction for mitigation and or accelerated receipt.
The contract dates and notice periods for the executive directors during the year were as follows: Name of director Date of contract Notice period P Heiden 16 December 2002 One year R L Gott 7 April 2005 One year N Bamford 2 June 2004 One year The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
The dates of the current non-executive directors appointments are as follows: Non-executive director Appointment date Date of last re-election Date of next re-election Mr R P Edey 6 November 1996 23 July 2003 Retired August 2006 Sir Michael Hodgkinson 1 April 2000 1 August 2006 1 August 2009 Mr C L Matthews 11 September 2003 21 July 2004 24 July 2007 Mr G F Page CBE 1 August 2004 20 July 2005 July 2008 Mr D J Pearl 27 September 2005 1 August 2006 1 August 2009 Mr R I Case CBE 7 February 2006 1 August 2006 1 August 2009 45 FKI plc Remuneration report Succession planning In 2004, the Company introduced a succession planning process for its executive directors and senior executive management as part of its risk management process.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2005 executive succession plan at its meeting in November 2006 and recommended actions to address succession issues in a small number of Group businesses.
The Executive Committee has continued to manage the development of potential successors.
The executive development programme continued in 2006 with the help of Ashridge in the UK and Babson College, Boston MA, in the USA.
Pensions With the exception of Mr Heiden, executive directors are members of the FKI Group Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme with a normal retirement age for directors of 60 years.
Mr Gott is also a special member of the FKI Group Pension Plan into which four instalments of 45,000 are being paid in lieu of his former Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme UURBS.
The Schemes main features, in respect of executive directors, are: a a cash benefit on death in service of four times annual rate of the highest average basic salary restricted to the earnings cap where it applies during any three consecutive years within the ten years before the members date of death.
Additional life assurance cover is purchased where necessary to provide death in service benefits relating to salary above the notional earnings cap: b pensions payable in the event of ill health: c pensions for dependants on a members death generally equal to half the members prospective retirement pension at 60 on death in service, or half the members pension entitlement on death in retirement: d member contributions are 7% of basic salary restricted to the notional earnings cap where it applies.
There are funded unapproved pension arrangements to increase pension benefits where, because of pension scheme limitations including those resulting from the notional earnings cap, these cannot be paid in total from the FKI Group Pension Scheme.
Such arrangements apply to Mr Gott.
In lieu of participation in the FKI Group Pension Scheme, Mr Heiden received contributions into a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme equivalent to 50% of his basic salary.
Details of this are shown in the table headed Directors emoluments on page 47.
Details of the directors pension benefits during the year under review are shown on page 48.
Non-executive directorships The Company believes that there are significant benefits to the individual and the Company from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships in other organisations.
Each executive director may normally accept one non-executive directorship provided that it does not conflict with the Companys interests and is approved by the Board.
Fees from any external directorship may be retained by the director concerned.
Mr Heiden held one non-executive position with United Utilities plc.
Details of fees received by him in 2006 07 in respect of this position are shown below: United Utilities plc 48,900 Appointed 5 October 2005 During the year Mr Gott was appointed non-executive director of Filtronic plc.
Details of fees received by him in 2006 07 in respect of this position are shown below: Filtronic plc 21,548 Appointed 13 July 2006 46 FKI plc Remuneration report Directors emoluments a b Basic salary fees Taxable benefits Bonus Total Pension contributions 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Executive directors Mr P Heiden 530 502 23 48 174 479 727 1,029 265 251 c Mr N Bamford 270 230 19 20 89 219 378 469 Mr R L Gott 273 260 24 24 45 157 342 441 101 96 Non-executive directors Mr G F Page CBE 135 135 135 135 Mr R P Edey 15 37 15 37 Sir Michael Hodgkinson 37 34 37 34 Mr C L Matthews 35 34 35 34 Mr D J Pearl 38 17 38 17 Mr R I Case CBE 40 5 40 5 Former director Mr C R N Clark 32 32 Aggregate emoluments 1,373 1,286 66 92 308 855 1,747 2,233 366 347 a Taxable benefits consist of permanent health insurance, company car or car allowances, life assurance and private medical insurance.
The reduction in Mr Heidens taxable benefits arises from more life assurance being provided by the Group Pension Scheme and therefore less purchased externally.
Also, Mr Heiden chose to receive a taxable car allowance of 15,000 pa as an alternative to a company car.
b Company contributions paid in respect of unapproved retirement benefit schemes.
c The Group Finance Directors salary was increased by 17.4% in 2006.
This increase was deemed appropriate in order to continue the progression of his salary toward the market median salary for the role.
Non-executive directors fees The fees paid to non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board after reviewing fee payments for comparable positions within similar organisations, and are normally reviewed every two years.
The fee structure for non-executive directors includes a basic fee of 35,000 and an additional fee of 5,000 for a committee chairmanship.
The basic fee for the senior non-executive director is 38,000.
The last review was in March 2006.
The Chairman waived his increase in 2006.
Fees for Mr R I Case are paid to Melchester Associates Ltd at his request.
47 FKI plc Remuneration report Directors pension benefits The under noted directors were members of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year.
Mr P Heiden is responsible for his own pension provision.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values were as follows during the year: Transfer value of increase in accrued benefit Increase in Increase in excluding Transfer Transfer transfer accrued inflation less Accrued Accrued value of value of value less pension contributions pension at pension at pension at pension at contributions excluding made by 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March made by inflation directors 2007 2006 2007 2006 directors Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Mr R L Gott 1.6 20.9 23.8 21.4 284.6 249.3 27.7 Mr N Bamford 14.2 176.3 72.6 56.4 796.9 594.4 185.7 Note: In addition to the accrued pension shown in the table, Mr Gott will receive a fixed pension of 24,400 from age 65 in respect of a transfer value paid into the Scheme.
The value of this pension is excluded from the transfer values shown.
1 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
2 The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
3 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, although no adjustment has been made for any under funding of the Scheme.
The calculation of each transfer value includes an allowance for the cost of death before retirement benefits.
4 The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is impacted by the following elements: a. the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation : b. the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation : c. the increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at the beginning of the year due to ageing: d. the change to the transfer value basis methodology: e. the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis: f. the effect of a. to e. less the directors own contributions over the year.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements which are reflected in e. and the change in method in d. above.
5 Directors have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
However, neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
6 Mr Gotts UK pension scheme benefits are subject to an earnings cap formerly the Inland Revenues earnings cap.
In addition, Mr Gott is being paid a supplement of 37% pa of salary plus an extra 45,000 pa until April 2008 to provide further pension benefits on a defined contribution basis.
2 The market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2007 was 116.25p 2006: 126p and the range during the year was 88p to 124p.
3 All executive share options granted in 1997 and subsequent years are exercisable from the dates stated above, subject to them satisfying the performance conditions stated in the policy section.
4 Executive Share Options granted in June 2004 under the former scheme were not subject to retesting.
5 Share options granted in 2006 vest on a different scale compared with options granted prior to 2006.
Details of the vesting scales for both new and former options are shown in the policy section.
6 Mr Gott exercised the savings related options at 60.0p per share and has retained beneficial ownership of these shares.
The awards are subject to the performance conditions for LTIP awards, as outlined in the policy section.
Performance shares granted in 2006 vest on a different scale compared with shares granted in the former LTIP prior to 2005.
Details of vesting scales can be found on page 43.
Notes: 1 The Companys Total Shareholder Return performance for the three-year performance period that ended in March 2007 ranked below median compared against its comparator group.
Under the terms of the rules applicable to the 2003 awards, 100% of the awards lapsed.
2 The market value of shares as yet unvested is stated at 116.25p per share, being the closing mid-market price on 31 March 2007.
If the ranking position of the award made in 2004 were to be maintained until the end of the respective performance period, the awards granted in 2004 would not vest.
3 The performance period end date for the LTIP award commencing on 11 June 2004 was previously incorrectly stated as 2 June 2007.
This has now been amended to 11 June 2007 which corresponds with the three-year performance period as set out in the rules of the Plan.
