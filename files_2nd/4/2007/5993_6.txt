The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company.
The information set out in the following section of the report is not subject to audit.
Remuneration Committee Remuneration of the executive directors, including the chairman, is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Members of the committee are the independent non-executive directors, who were Mr J M F Padovan and Mr G P Craig throughout the year and Mr M L Hawker from the time of his appointment on 4 July 2006.
Mr P E Jolly was a member until the time of his appointment as an executive director on 11 May 2006 but did not attend the meeting when the remuneration for his executive role was discussed.
The chairman was Mr Padovan who continues until his retirement from the board on 2 July 2007.
No member of the committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided, nor any potential conict of interest arising from cross-directorships, nor has he any day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The chairman of the company normally attends meetings of the committee by invitation except when matters concerning his own remuneration are discussed.
The committee is assisted when required by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who are appointed by the committee and who provide no other services to the company.
The Remuneration Committee meets two or more times a year.
Individual attendance details can be found within the Corporate Governance Report.
The committees terms of reference are available on the companys website www.
co. uk : its responsibilities include: determining the specic remuneration of each of the directors and the terms of their service agreements in particular, the term and any notice period : advising on and monitoring all performance-related formulae: administering all aspects of the share based incentive schemes operated by the company from time to time, including noting award levels made outside of the executive director population: reviewing on a continuing basis the companys policy on executive remuneration: having regard, in the performance of the above duties, to the requirements of the Listing Rules and the recommendations set out in the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules and any other published guidelines or recommendations regarding the remuneration of directors of listed companies which the committee considers relevant or appropriate: considering and making recommendations to the board concerning disclosure of details of remuneration packages and structures in addition to those required by law or by the UK Listing Authority or the London Stock Exchange: and considering such other matters as may be requested by the board.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors The remuneration policy for executive directors is to offer a remuneration package which will attract and retain the highest calibre of executive and to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are properly aligned with personal performance, the performance of the group, and the interests of shareholders.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is expected each year to be performance related.
This policy is expected to continue in future years.
The remuneration arrangements include basic salary and benets, performance related bonus, long term incentives and pension rights.
The main elements are: i Basic salary and benets The level of basic salary and benets is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the performance of the individual and advice and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar positions.
Individual salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee to maintain appropriate relativities within the executive director population and within a general policy that base salary levels are set at no higher than market median level in relation to similar sized UK listed businesses and considering other elements of the package.
Benets normally include the provision of a car, fuel, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and home telephone costs.
18 ii Performance related bonus Executive directors each receive an annual performance related bonus which in the past has been up to 60% of basic salary and these payments are largely dependent on achievement of profit targets.
The targets are set at levels which are challenging in relation to budgets which would produce significant growth.
The Committee is currently in the process of reviewing the current annual bonus arrangements, both in terms of quantum and structure, in light of current market practice.
Any revisions to the annual bonus arrangements will be reported in next years Board Report on Directors Remuneration.
iii Share options Executive directors have a continuing interest in share options previously granted as detailed below, however no options have been granted during the year other than one recruitment award, as was reported upon last year, and it is not the Remuneration Committees intention to make further share option awards.
iv Performance Share Plan PSP The Remuneration Committee reviews the long term incentives offered to executive directors on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain appropriate given the current needs of the business and wider best practice investor guidelines.
As a result of a review in early 2006, the Committee recommended the introduction of a new Performance Share Plan PSP to operate as the sole type of long term incentive arrangements for executive directors in future years.
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2006 annual general meeting.
Details of the PSP are set out below: Maximum award limit Executive directors and senior managers are eligible to receive conditional awards of Performance Shares up to a value of 150% of salary in any year.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, awards may be up to 200% of salary.
Performance conditions There are two distinct performance conditions that apply to awards made under the PSP.
Half of any award is subject to the growth in the companys normalised earnings per share EPS growth in excess of RPI.
The remaining half of an award will be subject to the relative total shareholder return TSR of the company compared against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
For awards made in year ending 31 March 2007, awards will vest on the third anniversary of grant, dependent upon the achievement of the following performance criteria over the three financial years 2006 07, 2007 08 and 2008 09: EPS growth of the company over Vesting percentage of 50% of the shares the performance period subject to an award 11111111 Less than RPI 12% 0% RPI 12% 25% RPI 27% 100% Between RPI 12% and RPI 27% Between 25% and 100% pro rata on a straight-line basis TSR ranking of the company compared to the Vesting percentage of 50% of the shares comparator group over the performance period subject to an award 11111111 Below median ranking 0% Median ranking 25% Upper quartile ranking 100% Between median and upper quartile ranking Between 25% and 100% pro rata on a straight-line basis EPS and TSR remain the most appropriate measures of the groups long-term performance.
EPS is the key internal metric through which financial performance is measured and TSR is aligned with shareholders and the objective of generating long term sustainable returns to shareholders.
In line with best practice guidelines, the Committee is currently in the process of reviewing the range of EPS targets that will apply to any awards made under the PSP in the year ending 31 March 2008 to ensure that they reect the companys current prospects and circumstances.
Any revisions to the EPS range will be reported in next years Board Report on Directors Remuneration.
To determine whether the performance targets have actually been met at the end of the three year performance period, the EPS targets will be calculated by the company and veried by the Remuneration Committee.
TSR calculations will be performed by the Committees advisors and veried by the Remuneration Committee.
co. uk 19 v Shareholding guidelines At the same time as introducing the PSP the Remuneration Committee introduced share ownership guidelines.
Executive directors are expected to retain no fewer than 50% of any shares delivered under the PSP net of taxes until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of their base salary has been achieved.
vi Pension rights Generally, the policy for executive directors pension arrangements is to offer a contribution towards the executives pension arrangement.
From the date of his appointment as an executive director the company provides 15% of Mr P E Jollys basic salary for contribution into his SIPP.
The other executive directors have historically participated in the companys dened benefit pension arrangement the Findel Group Pension Fund the Scheme which targeted a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings at a normal retirement age of either 60 or 65.
Mr D B Dutton remains a contributory member of the Scheme with Dr I J Bolton and Mr P B Maudsley participating during the year under review on a non-contributory basis.
Life assurance cover is four times salary for Mr Dutton and Dr Bolton and three times salary for Mr Maudsley.
Pensionable earnings for Mr Dutton and Mr Maudsley are dened as one third of the aggregate of the members basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement.
Pensionable earnings for Dr Bolton are dened as the aggregate of basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement plus one ninth of the aggregate of performance related bonuses paid in the same three year period.
The Remuneration Committee has considered historically that the inclusion of a small proportion of annual bonus paid in the denition of pensionable pay to be justied after considering overall levels of base salary and bonus potential, and considering the smoothing effect of averaging the bonuses paid over three years.
From May 2007 Dr Bolton is no longer a member of the scheme having elected to take a transfer value out of the Scheme.
While Mr Maudsley remains a member of the Scheme, he no longer accrues benets under the pension Scheme, instead electing to receive a cash equivalent contribution into a personal pension arrangement.
The value of contributions made during the year was 59,126.
Messrs K Chapman and D A Johnson are no longer members of the Scheme and also receive a contribution to a personal arrangement in lieu of the value of pension benets.
Company contributions to their personal arrangements during the year under review amounted to 64,861 and 12,934 respectively.
The contributions to personal pension arrangements are cost neutral or lower from the companys perspective when compared to the cost of providing benets under the dened benefit scheme.
Performance Graph The following graph contrasts the total shareholder return of the company calculated in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2003 with the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
This index was selected as being, in the opinion of the committee, the most appropriate for comparison because the group is a member of the FTSE 350.
Findel plc 5-year total return v total return of FTSE 350 General Retailers Index 3 month rolling average 350 Findel - cumulative FTSE 350 General Retailers - cumulative 300 250 200 150 100 50 y e March 2003 y e March 2004 y e March 2005 y e March 2006 y e March 2007 Source: Datastream 20 Service Agreements It continues to be the Remuneration Committees policy that service agreements for executive directors should be terminable on not more than 12 months notice, in line with current market practice.
In the event of early termination of a service agreement, the committee would consider appropriate use of mitigation and phased compensation payments.
Mr Chapmans service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 12 June 1989 and has been subsequently varied, most recently with effect from 1 April 2003.
On a change of control as dened in his contract, the company is deemed to have automatically given notice of termination of the service agreement.
Mr Chapman would, therefore, be entitled to a damages payment of 1 times current base salary together with an amount equal to the average of benets in kind and bonus payable over each of the three previous years.
The board would also use such discretions as it may have to allow Mr Chapman to exercise any outstanding share options.
Dr Boltons service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
Dr Bolton would, therefore, be entitled to a damages payment of 1 times current base salary together with an amount equal to the average of benets in kind and bonus payable over each of the three previous years.
Mr Maudsleys service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 6 October 1997.
The contract contains no provision for compensation to be payable on early termination and assessment of damages would be subject to mitigation.
Mr Duttons service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 20 September 1991 and was subsequently varied on 31 August 2001.
Mr Jollys service agreement was entered into on 11 May 2006.
It is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party: it contains no provision for compensation to be payable on early termination and assessment of damages would be subject to mitigation.
Mr Johnsons service agreement until his retirement as an executive director was terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 12 June 1989 and was subsequently varied, most recently with effect from 1 April 2003: it terminated on 3 July 2006.
The appointment of non-executive directors is for an initial period of 3 years, subject to review and re-election at General Meeting.

Except for Mr Padovan, who is not seeking re-election, they are each due to be proposed for re-election at the annual general meeting in 2007 and for Mr Craig and Mr Johnson annually thereafter.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the board having taken advice on appropriate levels.
The current fee of Mr Craig is 37,500 per annum, and of Mr Padovan, Mr Johnson and Mr Hawker is 35,000 per annum.
Mr Johnson also receives 60,000 per annum for consultancy services under separate arrangements, which can be terminated at any time on six months notice by either party.
