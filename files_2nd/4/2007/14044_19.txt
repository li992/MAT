The Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE 350 Index, which is a broad equity market index in which it is a constituent.
As detailed earlier, TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares, and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares.
Remuneration report Serco Group plc 69 Pensions and life assurance This section has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.
The Directors receive pension and life assurance benefits consistent with those provided by other leading companies.
The details of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in note 28.
In the event of death in service, each scheme provides for a lump sum payment as well as a dependants pension.
The accrued pension benefits of all Directors under the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, are as follows: Gross Increase in Transfer value Transfer value Increase increase accrued Value of of accrued of accrued Directors in transfer in accrued pension increase in Total benefits at benefits at contributions value pension during the accrual accrued 31 December 31 December for the during during year, net of over the pension at 2007 2006 year the year the year inflation year year end 4 1 2 3 1 - 2 - 3 5 6 7 8 Kevin Beeston 2,921,990 1,966,075 955,915 13,392 3,302 35,455 272,106 Christopher Hyman 776,483 370,763 405,720 18,677 17,044 218,589 60,544 Andrew Jenner 363,309 151,823 211,486 11,131 10,300 113,354 32,440 Grant Rumbles 2,164,769 1,400,899 763,870 20,553 15,899 246,046 139,884 Notes: a The total accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to the end of this year, or for Kevin Beeston and Grant Rumbles, to 5 April 2006 when they opted out of the scheme.
The increase in accrued pension during the year is shown both as a gross increase and excluding any increase in respect of inflation.
b Grant Rumbles became a Director with effect from 3 July 2007.
The pension note above covers accrual over the whole year and also shows the transfer value of his accrued benefits at the end of the previous year.
c The pensions which Kevin Beeston and Grant Rumbles had accrued up to 5 April 2006, when they opted out of the Scheme, are increased in line with their pensionable remuneration averaged over three years since 5 April 2006.
The increase in Kevin Beestons accrued pension over the year to 31 December 2007 is largely due to inflation, as shown by columns 5 and 6.
The increase in Grant Rumbles accrued pension is a result of a significant increase in his basic remuneration over the past year.
The increase in the accrued pensions of Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner allow for both the increase in their pensionable salaries over the year and for the accrual of a further year of pensionable service as a result of a further years active membership of the Scheme.
d Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of the Guidance Note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The assumptions used for calculating transfer values were reviewed during the year and updated to reflect improvements in mortality expectations and the investment strategy of the scheme.
This has resulted in higher transfer values than would have applied using the previous assumptions.
The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes not only the effect of the changes in the assumptions, but also the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
e The value of the increase in accrual shown in 7 is the value of the net increase in pension shown in 6 and represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that his service terminated at the year end, or 5 April 2006 in the case of Kevin Beeston and Grant Rumbles.
It is based on the increase in the accrued pension net of inflation.
f With effect from 1 January 2007 Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner opted to have their contributions paid by the Company under SMART salary sacrifice and hence no contributions were paid by the Directors during the year.
g Transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
h Christopher Hyman also benefits from a defined contribution arrangement to which the Company contributed prior to April 2005.
The Companys contributions to this arrangement were 15% of remuneration in excess of the Permitted Maximum under the approved Scheme.
There were no contributions to this arrangement in 2007. i Andrew Jenner also benefits from a defined contribution arrangement to which the Company contributed prior to June 2005.
There were no contributions to this arrangement in 2007.
