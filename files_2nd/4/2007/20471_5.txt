30 REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration report Scope of report The remuneration report summarises the Groups remuneration policy and particularly its application with respect to the Directors.
The report also describes how the Group applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to Directors remuneration in accordance with the Combined Code and Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Remuneration Committee The Committee is appointed by the Board and comprises only Non-executive Directors.
The Committee is chaired by John Sussens, the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, with the other members being Martin Jackson and Margaret Johnson.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to meetings where the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their advice on the matters under review.
During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Committee met on five separate occasions.
Its remit includes recommending the remuneration of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, and the Company Secretary: review of the remuneration of senior management: review of the awards made under the performance related incentive schemes.
The Committees terms of reference, which are reviewed at least annually and approved by the Board, are available on the Groups corporate website and are summarised in the Corporate Governance Report.
The members of the Committee do not have any personal financial interests or any conflicts from cross-directorships that relate to the business of the Committee.
The members do not have any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
During the year the Committee did not purchase any consultancy services but the Company Secretary circulates market survey results as appropriate.
Remuneration policy The Group is committed to the primary objective of maximising shareholder value over time.
The Committee reviews the framework and remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the most senior managers.
The main principles underlying the remuneration policy are: Competitive The Group pays below-median salaries but with attractive incentives which provide opportunity for highly competitive total reward packages for superior performance.
Performance linked A significant part of Executive Directors and senior managers reward is determined by the Groups earnings growth.
Failure to achieve threshold levels of growth in the Groups earnings results in reduced or no payout under the Groups Long-term incentive plan.
Shareholder aligned A considerable part of the reward is related to the growth in earnings versus LIBOR.
Executive Directors have agreed to retain a minimum shareholding equal to at least 100% of base salary which can be built up over a period of five years from the date of appointment.
Transparent All aspects of the remuneration structure are clear to employees and openly communicated.
Death in Service scheme, paying three times salary available to all employees following completion of their probationary period.
Group Personal Pension Plan, matching employee contributions up to a maximum 6% of base salary with a total annual cap of 4,800.
Available to all employees with one years service.
Private Medical Cover, available to approximately 100 management level staff.
Permanent Health Insurance policy covering the same staff who are eligible for Private Medical Cover.
ADMIRAL GROUP plc 31 Approved Free Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The SIP is available to all staff Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have declined to be included in the plan.
The maximum annual award under the SIP is 3,000 per employee.
Shares awarded under the SIP are forfeited if the employee leaves within three years of the award.
Awards are made twice a year, based on the results of each half-year.
During 2005, 2006 and 2007 the Groups results have meant that qualifying staff have received maximum awards in each year.
Discretionary Free Share Scheme DFSS.
Awards under the DFSS are distributed on a wider basis than most plans of this type.
The Committee believes that as the DFSS develops and awards begin to vest in 2008, it will have the effect of reducing staff attrition and creating a definite alignment of the interests of staff and shareholders.
Of the Groups current Executive Directors, only Kevin Chidwick Finance Director participates in this scheme.
The performance criterion in determining how many shares vest under the DFSS is the growth in earnings per share EPS in excess of a risk free return, defined as average 3-month LIBOR, over a three-year period.
The Committee feels that this is a good indicator of long-term shareholder return with which to align staff incentivisation.
The Committee recommends for approval by the Board awards to the Finance Director and other employees under the DFSS.
The EPS targets are such that for full vesting of shares to occur, the average EPS growth over the three-year performance period would have to be approximately 16% per annum assuming LIBOR averages 5% over the period.
Only 10% of shares vest for matching LIBOR over the three-year period.
The plan allows for a maximum award of 400,000 or 600% of basic salary if lower.
The Committee is conscious of the maximum allowable awards under both share schemes and controls are in place to ensure that neither scheme is issued shares in excess of 5% of the Group's issued share capital over the 10 year period from 1 January 2005.
The Committee determines the fees for the Chairman of the Board after consultation with the Executive Directors and review of market data.
The fees of the Chairman were not subject to review in 2007.
The Chairman waives 25% of his fee.
Non-executive Directors remuneration is set by the Chairman and Executive Directors and approved by the Board as a whole.
A summary of their contracts and remuneration is shown below.
Executive Directors are allowed, or though none currently do, to accept appointments as Nonexecutive Directors of companies with prior approval of the Chairman.
Approval will only be given where the appointment does not present a conflict of interest with the Groups activities and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the development of the individual.
Where fees are payable in respect of each appointment these will be retained by the Company.
Executive Directors remuneration Two of the three Executive Directors Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens are founding Directors.
They and the Committee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders.
In light of this, their remuneration packages consist of below-median base salary compared to market rates by the Committee and benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service cover.
The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf of these Executive Directors, and they have not, nor is it intended that they will participate in any Group share schemes.
Their remuneration was reviewed in September 2007.
Henry Engelhardt was awarded a rise of 5.2% taking his salary to 305,000 and David Stevens awarded a rise of 6% taking his salary to 265,000 The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration of the Finance Director is fair and in total, in-line with market rates, and is designed to provide rewards for achieving increases in shareholder value.
Remuneration report 30 - 35 32 REMUNERATION REPORT In addition to benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance, death in service cover and eligibility to the Groups Personal Pension Plan, there are two main elements to the Finance Directors remuneration package: Basic annual salary Awards under the DFSS.
It is the Committees general strategy to pay salaries at or slightly below median levels together with awards under the DFSS bringing the total remuneration to competitive levels for superior performance.
With effect from 1 October 2007 Kevin Chidwicks base salary was increased to 240,000, an increase of 20%.
Kevin Chidwick received an award of 23,000 free shares on 18 April 2007 with a value at the date of the award of 241,500.
The awards are the maximum number of shares that could vest after a three-year period and are subject to performance criteria as described above.
