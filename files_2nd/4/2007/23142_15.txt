Directors Remuneration Report The Directors have prepared this report, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires your Companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on 32.
Remuneration Committee The Company has five non-executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee fulfils the function of a Remuneration Committee.
Policy on Directors Fees The Nomination Committees policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole, be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts that are similar in size, have a similar capital structure and have a similar investment objective.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 31 January 2008 and subsequent years.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The Nomination Committee has appointed the Manager to provide comparative and other information when the Directors consider the level of Directors fees.
The level of Directors fees has remained the same since 2005, but at the most recent review, it was agreed to increase the fees payable to the Chairman and Directors to 21,000 and 14,000 respectively.
All members of the Audit Committee are paid an additional 2,000 per annum, bringing the total annual fees to 23,000 for the Chairman and 16,000 for each Director effective 1 February 2007.
Directors Service Contracts It is the Boards policy that none of the Directors has a service contract.
The terms of their appointment provide that each Director shall retire and be subject to re-election at the first Annual General Meeting after his appointment, and at least every three years after that.
The terms also provide that a Director may be removed without notice and that compensation will not be due on leaving office.
Directors and officers liability insurance is held by the Company in respect of the Directors.
This insurance is not a benefit in kind, nor does it form part of the Directors remuneration.
