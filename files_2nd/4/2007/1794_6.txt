The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 under the Funds rules and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits.
With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were changed, and as a result the HMRC earnings cap is no longer in force.
However, a Fund-specic earnings cap has been retained in the Fund.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund earnings cap for pension purposes.
Details of the taxable cash supplements paid to them by the Company, in lieu of pension provision above the Fund earnings cap are shown in the table on page 19.
Directors may be paying additional voluntary contributions, but neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the tables below.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive Directors service to 31 December 2007 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.
