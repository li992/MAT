motivate experienced individuals, capable of making a major contribution to Hammersons success.
It is the Committees objective, having regard to the views of investors, that the Companys remuneration policy should provide for median, or below median, basic salary but with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for superior performance through variable remuneration in the form of bonus and long-term incentives.
Remuneration for Executive Directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance-related bonus scheme and, for long-term performance, by the award of shares under a long-term incentive plan.
The Boards intention is that Executive Directors and senior executives should build a shareholding in the Company with a value equivalent to at least their annual basic salary.
Shares to satisfy awards under the various schemes are acquired by market purchases In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of investors and their representatives.
060 Annual Report 2007 annual performanCe-relaTed bonus sCheme Staff throughout the Company, including Executive Directors, participate in a performance-related bonus scheme.
Payments under the scheme, which are not pensionable, are based on the achievement of earnings per share, net asset value and operational targets and personal objectives.
The targets are reviewed and set annually by the Committee and are designed so that payment of the maximum would only be achieved for exceptional performance.
The maximum amount payable to Executive Directors in 2007 was up to 100% of their basic salary, with 60% of the payment receivable in shares in the Company of which half vest immediately and half vest two years after the date of grant.
Having noted recent increases in variable pay potential of other real estate companies and being conscious of the need to retain and motivate key executives while constraining fixed costs, the Committee has decided to increase the maximum bonus potential for 2008 to 200% of salary.
The enhanced bonus potential will only be payable for the achievement of more challenging targets than apply to the current bonus scheme.
The bonus will continue to be paid in a mixture of cash and shares as outlined above.
Between 1 January 2007 and 27 February 2008 the following shares were issued to Executive Directors under the bonus scheme, based on the achievement of performance targets in respect of the previous financial year: Number of shares Date of grant 1 March 2007 27 February 2008 John Richards 4,686 4,240 David Atkins 789 2,011 Peter Cole 3,276 3,059 Grard Devaux 1,827 2,045 Simon Melliss 3,276 3,059 deferred share plan Following the introduction of the Hammerson plc 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2007, no further options have been granted under the Deferred Share Plan.
Under the terms of the Plan, the actual number of shares received by participants is based on the comparative total shareholder return performance of the Company against a peer group of the eight largest quoted UK property companies, including Hammerson.
There will be no vesting of shares unless the Companys performance is in the top half of the comparator group and there will be a progressive vesting schedule according to the Companys ranking within the top half of the comparator group as follows: Ranking % of shares vesting 1st 100.00 2nd 83.34 3rd 66.67 4th 50.00 The Plan is administered by a Trustee which has acquired shares, financed by drawing down interest-free loan facilities from the Company, to satisfy the issue of shares to participants under the Plan and other share incentive schemes.
At 31 December 2007 the Trustee held 293,073 shares, 442,064 shares having been used during the year for payments under the Plan and other share incentive schemes.
Under the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is obliged to waive dividends on this holding of shares, except for a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2007 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under all grants made under the Plan was as follows: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 8 March 2005 1 March 2006 John Richards 46,685 38,700 David Atkins 13,600 10,934 Peter Cole 28,771 27,701 Grard Devaux 27,685 22,813 Simon Melliss 32,571 27,701 Annual Report 2007 061 section remuneration report continued long-Term inCenTive plan The Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was introduced in 2007 and which replaces the Deferred Share Plan, provides for conditional awards of Performance Shares worth up to 200% of salary with a 300% limit in exceptional circumstances although the Committee has no current intention to make awards worth more than 150% of salary.
The performance measures applicable to the Plan are a combination of Total Shareholder Return TSR performance thus aligning the interests of Directors with shareholders and Total Property Return TPR to focus on the underlying property returns.
For Executive Directors, one half of the award is based on each of these performance measures over a single three year performance period.
TPR performance is measured over three financial years commencing with the year of grant and in comparison with a composite index comprising Investment Property Databanks IPD Annual UK Index and Annual France All Property Index, the relative composition of which may vary with each grant to ensure that it reflects the Companys portfolio.
For the initial grant made on 11 June 2007 the ratio was 70% UK and 30% France.
Vesting under the TPR performance condition is as follows: less than index 0% equal to index 25% index 0.5% average p. a.
100% Vesting for intermediate performance is pro-rata on a straight-line basis.
Prior to each grant, the Committee considers this range of targets to ensure they remain appropriate in the light of experience and anticipated future performance.
TSR performance is measured over a single three year period from the date of grant, in comparison with a comparator group currently comprising 16 entities, including some European real estate companies.
Vesting under the TSR performance condition is as follows: Below TSR of median-ranked entity 0% Equal to TSR of median-ranked entity 25% Equal to TSR of upper quartile-ranked entity 100% Awards between median and upper quartile entities are on a sliding scale between 25% and 100%.
The level of threshold vesting will apply only for awards with a face value of up to 150% of salary i. e. with a maximum threshold vesting of 37.5% of salary and for larger awards other than when used on recruitment the vesting at threshold will not exceed 37.5% of salary.
Between 1 January 2007 and 27 February 2008 the following conditional share awards were made to Executive Directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 11 June 2007 John Richards 47,798 David Atkins 22,667 Peter Cole 34,494 Grard Devaux 29,566 Simon Melliss 34,494 062 Annual Report 2007 savings relaTed share opTion sCheme The Directors interests in options over ordinary shares of the Company under the Companys savings related share option scheme are as follows: 1 January 31 December Exercise Expiry 2007 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2007 price year John Richards 995 995 939.20p 2009 David Atkins 1,351 1,351 701.20p 2008 Peter Cole 2,356 2,356 701.20p 2010 Simon Melliss 995 995 939.20p 2009 share inCenTive plan All UK employees are eligible to receive Free Shares up to a value of 3,000 each year, subject to achievement of a performance target under the Share Incentive Plan SIP.

Pension entitlements are based on basic salary.
In previous years, members who joined the Scheme on or after 1 June 1989 were subject to restrictions imposed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Following the introduction of the Finance Act 2004, these restrictions no longer apply for service accrued on or after 6 April 2006.
In the case of Simon Melliss, provision in respect of pensionable salary above the restriction was paid to a money purchase arrangement prior to 6 April 2006.
Grard Devaux also participates in the unfunded pension scheme to obtain the same overall level of pension provision as other Executive Directors.
His benefits are offset by certain arrangements in France and the increase in his French benefits has reduced the benefit accrued under the Companys Scheme in 2007.
No pension arrangements are made by the Company for Non-Executive Directors.
Since 6 April 2006 an individuals benefits under the Companys pension scheme would be subject to additional tax should those benefits exceed certain defined limits.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that, in these circumstances, a Director may elect to receive a Pension Compensation Payment rather than further contributions being made to the Scheme.
Such compensation payments will be subject to income tax and national insurance contributions and will not qualify for annual bonus purposes or entitlements under long-term incentive plans.
The following tables set out information on Directors defined benefit pension entitlements, including funded and unfunded arrangements: Increase Increase Decrease Total Decrease in accrued accrued in accrued benefit during Years benefit at benefit the year Age at service at 31 December during excluding 31 December 31 December 2007 the year inflation 2007 2007 000 000 000 John Richards 51 26 249 14 5 David Atkins 41 9 22 5 5 Peter Cole 48 18 146 11 7 Grard Devaux 59 21 123 6 11 Simon Melliss 55 16 72 13 11 For each Director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2007 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each Director at 31 December 2007.
