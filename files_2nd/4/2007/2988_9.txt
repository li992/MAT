Remuneration policy The primary aim of the Committee is to ensure that remuneration aligns the interests of management and shareholders and reinforces behaviour which will lead to the continued long-term development of the business.
The Committee makes its recommendations to the Board by taking into account: The experience of Executive Directors and other senior managers: The Groups competitiveness in the market place, assessed through independent external market comparisons: The growing international nature of the Group: and The development of new business streams and the added complexity to the business.
The growth of the Group has been such that it continues to be appropriate to compare against companies in the FTSE 100.
Alongside this, a benchmark has been established of the 15 companies above and below the Company in terms of market capitalisation.
The overall remuneration policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, retain and motivate executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specic performance measures.
In particular, the Committee has recognised that the complexity of the Group continues to evolve and that the remuneration policy should be adjusted to reect the calibre of executives needed to continue to develop and grow the business.
The approach is to set xed remuneration at market median levels and to offer variable rewards, linked to the performance of the Group, which can provide significant overall levels of remuneration for exceptional performance and shareholder value creation.
Approximately 72% of Executive Directors total remuneration, including share awards, earned in the period was performance related.
Charles Dunstone does not receive long-term incentive share awards.
Components of remuneration The main xed and performancerelated elements of remuneration that can be awarded to Executive Directors are as follows: basic salary, benets and pension contribution xed : annual performance bonus variable : share options variable : and Performance Shares variable.
The Company operates a minimum shareholding policy, requiring Executive Directors to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company of at least 100% of their annual salaries.
Salaries and benefits Executive Directors basic salaries are reviewed annually and take into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individuals and information obtained from published market data on the salary rates for similar positions in companies of a similar size.
Salaries are reviewed on 1 July each year.
Following the most recent review, salaries from 1 July 2007 will be held at their current levels.
com 26 Remuneration Report continued Annual Performance Bonus The Company operates a bonus scheme designed to reect the performance of the Group.
Bonuses are governed by performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that maximum variable rewards are paid only for exceptional performance.
The bonus scheme for the period ending 29 March 2008 will have targets based on improvements in Headline EPS see note 11 to the financial statements before tax, with a maximum payment of 200% of annual salary.
Annual Deferred Bonus Plan In the period, Executive Directors and senior managers had the option of taking some or all of their cash bonus in the form of a deferred share award.
The rights to deferred shares cannot be exercised for 12 months.
Matching shares may also be awarded if the deferred share award is not exercised for up to a further two years.
The number of matching shares awarded equates to 12.5% of the deferred amount at the beginning of each year.
The share equivalent of dividends that would have been paid on the shares is added to the deferred share award each year.
This scheme will be reviewed during the next year.
Share options The Company has a share option scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers both in the UK and overseas.
No options were granted to Executive Directors in the period ended 31 March 2007 and it is currently not envisaged that grants will be made to them in the forthcoming year.
A UK savings-related share option scheme is open to all eligible employees in the UK, including Executive Directors.
No Executive Director currently participates in the scheme.
Performance Share Plan In July 2004, senior managers, including Executive Directors, received awards of Performance Shares as dened in the Annual General Meeting on 28 July 2004.
Further awards were made to certain individuals in the period ended 1 April 2006.
These awards are subject to a mixture of Headline EPS and Total Shareholder Return TSR performance targets measured over a three or four year performance period.
In December 2006 the Remuneration Committee awarded a further grant under the Performance Share Plan.
The new award is subject to TSR performance targets measured against an initial performance period to 4 June 2010 and a subsequent performance period to 4 June 2011.
The TSR calculation is independently calculated for the Remuneration Committee by Mercer.
Details of the grants to Executive Directors and the performance targets are set out in the share tables later in the Report.
