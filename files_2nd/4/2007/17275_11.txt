Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 3 February 2007 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee which has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
Composition and Terms of Reference The Remuneration Committee consists of the independent Non-Executive Directors who are Andrew Beeson Chairman, Prue Leith OBE until her resignation, Roger Jones, David Simons CBE, Richard North and Fru Hazlitt.
Its composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code.
The Company complies with Section B of the Combined Code provisions on Directors remuneration and in respect of the Remuneration Report content.
The Committees aim is to ensure that the Executive Directors are rewarded for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance the return to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
In addition, they have regard to pay and conditions for other employees in the Group especially the arrangements for directors of subsidiaries who are not Directors of the Company.
The Committee is advised internally by the Human Resources Director and the Head of Group Reward.
External advice was provided during the year by Towers Perrin in relation to salary benchmarking and the overall levels of remuneration packages in comparative companies.
Towers Perrin was appointed by the Head of Group Reward on behalf of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition to data provided by Towers Perrin, the Committee also took into account information from other remuneration surveys.
The Committee also took advice from Deloitte in respect of long-term incentive plans.
Remuneration Policy The Committee continues to maintain a policy consistent with Group Reward Principles applied for all employees throughout the Group and in line with the Companys business objectives which: attracts, retains and motivates high calibre Directors: is appropriate to the Company, taking into account information from independent sources and from within the retail sector as well as other companies of a comparable size: aligns the interests of Directors and shareholders by linking share and cash incentives to performance: complies with best practice and comprises a mix of fixed and variable pay with longer-term incentives.
When comparing remuneration packages with those in other companies, particular regard is taken of companies in the FTSE 250 and other retailers.
The reward principles applied throughout the Group provide for basic salaries to be set at the median for a range of comparative companies with reward for performance aimed at delivering an overall package that is competitive.
For the Chief Executive, the variable, performance-related remuneration represents 58 per cent of the total package for on target performance.
For other Executive Directors, the variable, performancerelated remuneration represents 44 per cent of the total package for on target performance.
Components of Remuneration Basic Salary Basic salary for each Director is reviewed each year in the context of market conditions affecting executive remuneration, affordability and the level of increases awarded to staff throughout the Group.
Basic salary levels are generally set at not more than the median for a range of comparative companies.
During the year ended 3 February 2007, Directors and colleagues in the Group generally received a salary increase of 3 per cent except for increases awarded on promotion.
Salaries for Directors will next be reviewed in August 2007.
Benefits In addition to salaries and the items described below, the Company provides a range of competitive benefits including pension, a fully-expensed car or non-pensionable cash allowance and private medical insurance.
Service contract The policy of the Committee is that notice periods should be set at not more than 12 months.
The service contract for Tony Page provides for the Company to give a greater notice period during the first year of his employment.
The initial notice period of 24 months reduces each month so that at the end of the first year of employment it becomes, and remains at, 12 months.
No other Executive Director has a service contract with a notice period longer than 12 months.
Bonus Executive Directors and directors of subsidiaries participated in the Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan AIP during the year see page 28.
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman, does not participate in any incentive plans.
For this year, Tony Page was entitled to a fixed payment of 150,000, which was agreed at the time he joined the Company, partly to compensate for incentives he lost when he resigned his previous employment.
For all Directors, bonuses are non-pensionable.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Directors Remuneration Report 27 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 3 February 2007 Share Options Executive Share Option Schemes The Company no longer grants share options under the Woolworths Group plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme.
For options granted in earlier years, the performance targets declared in the 2003 Directors Remuneration Report apply.
Fully diluted, adjusted Earnings Per Share, as calculated in accordance with the Scheme rules Scheme EPS, must increase by 6 per cent per annum commencing with the Companys financial year immediately prior to the date of grant plus RPI over a three-year period in order for the option to be exercised in full.
If this is not achieved, growth in Scheme EPS of 5 per cent per annum plus RPI over the same period is required in order for up to 50 per cent of the option to be exercised.
If either of these targets is not met after the first three-year period there will be a retest one year later over a four-year period, from the same base, and the same proportion of the option will be available for exercise.
If neither of the targets has been achieved after four years the option will lapse.
In the event of a change of control of the Company the performance conditions will not be automatically waived.
A minimum target of an increase in Scheme EPS of 2 per cent per annum plus RPI will normally have to be met.
The option will normally be exercisable only in proportion to the number of months that have elapsed from grant to the date of early exercise against a total of 36 months.
The performance targets for options granted in March 2003 and September 2003 have not been achieved and the options have lapsed.
There is one retest of the performance target for the options granted in March 2004, but it now appears unlikely that this target will be met.
A limit of 5 per cent of the total issued share capital on the number of new shares that can be issued to satisfy executive options granted under Executive Share Schemes applies over a ten-year period.
At the year-end, outstanding share options represented 4 per cent of the total issued share capital.
Savings-Related Share Options A savings-related share option scheme ShareSave is open to all eligible employees in the UK.
The sixth grant of options under ShareSave was made in May 2006 and it is intended that options will be granted annually under this arrangement provided the scheme continues to provide a cost-effective method of enabling employees to share in the success of the Group.
Incentives and Bonuses Calculation of EPS in respect of share-based incentive plans is in accordance with the individual plan rules.
Woolworths Group Incentive Plan The Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP was replaced by the Annual Incentive Plan described below in 2004.
Executive Directors previously had an opportunity to defer receipt of their declared bonus for three years, at the completion of which it is matched by 25 per cent in shares which are purchased in the market at the time of the election to defer.
The outstanding share awards made to Executive Directors are shown on page 34.
The Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan Executive Directors, directors of subsidiaries and other senior employees participate in the Plan.
It operates on an annual basis and participants do not participate in any other annual bonus scheme.
The Plan provides for two types of Award: a Cash Award, which is paid after the end of the financial year and which, for Executive Directors, is based on the achievement of financial targets and meeting personal objectives.
The Cash Award for the Chief Executive will be 60 per cent at target rising to a maximum of 120 per cent.
For other Executive Directors, the Cash Award will be 40 per cent at target rising to a maximum of 80 per cent.
The main financial targets are Group profit, operating company profit, sales, cash targets, stock, margin and costs: a Share Award, which is made after the end of the financial year and which is based on the achievement of Group financial targets.
For Executive Directors the Share Award for achieving target performance is 20 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 40 per cent for exceptional performance.
Shares comprised in a Share Award will be held in an employee share trust for a vesting period of three years.
At the end of the vesting period a multiplier will be applied if a performance target is met.
For on target performance the multiplier for Executive Directors will be 1.3 rising to a maximum of two for exceptional performance.
If a participant leaves the Company during the vesting period no multiplier will apply.
On a change of control of the Company the Committee will determine whether the multiplier will apply taking into account the performance from the Award date to the date on which the change of control occurs.
The Committee considers it important that Directors and senior employees focus on delivering annual targets set each year.
Cash Awards and Share Awards are based on the achievement of these targets.
The performance measure for the multiplier is growth in adjusted, fully diluted Earnings Per Share from continuing operations Plan EPS.
Awards for the Year Ended 3 February 2007 Awards are earned both for the achievement of profit targets based on budgets and compared with broker estimates as well as for meeting personal objectives for the year.
The Group profit was below the lower end of expectations and the performance of operating companies was mixed.
The Cash Award for the Chief Executive reflects the achievements at Entertainment UK Limited where, by the end of the financial year, new business secured during the year compensated for the loss of the Tesco contract and profits exceeded budget.
In a range of measures, the Chief Executives targets for Entertainment UK Limited, 2entertain and growth in online sales in Woolworths were achieved.
One-third of the potential Cash Award depended on Group profit and accordingly no bonus is due for this.
Other measures included cash, where the average net debt target was not achieved, stock, which was well controlled, gross margin, which increased by more than target and sales in refurbished stores.
The range of measures for other Executive Directors included profit targets for their respective operating companies.
The outcome in Entertainment UK is a Cash Award of 58.5 per cent of salary for the Managing Director.
At Woolworths, the Managing Director, Retail and Distribution received a Cash award of 24 per cent of salary due to costs being substantially lower than target and online sales exceeding target.
The Cash Awards for Executive Directors range between 24 per cent and 58.5 per cent of salary.
No Share Awards are due as the lower end of the targets set last year have not been met.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Directors Remuneration Report 28 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 3 February 2007 Awards for the Year Ending 2 February 2008 The Cash Award will again be based on the achievement of financial targets and meeting personal objectives.
The main financial targets are Group profit, operating company profit, sales, cash targets, stock, margin and costs.
Share Awards, to be made after the end of the financial year, will also be based on the achievement of Group profit targets with additional shares awarded on the basis described above.
For Executive Directors, the target Share Award will be 20 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 40 per cent.
Matching shares will also be subject to Plan EPS performance targets to be set when the Share Award is made.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Committee may consider it appropriate to waive the performance targets for the Chief Executives Awards so that the Chief Executive receives a cash bonus of up to 100 per cent of salary in lieu of any other Cash or Share Awards that may be payable for that year under the Plan.
The Woolworths Group Performance Share Plan Executive Directors and Directors of subsidiaries participate in this Plan.
It provides for participants to receive an Award of Shares every six months, after the announcement of annual and half-yearly results.
For Executive Directors the value of the shares comprised in each Award will be equal in value to 20 per cent of basic salary at the date the Award is made.
The shares will be held in an employee trust for a vesting period of three years.
For exceptional performance the Award may increase to 50 per cent of salary.
Awards made to Executive Directors during the year to 3 February 2007 are shown on page 34.
For Awards to be made during the financial year ending 2 February 2008, there will be two performance criteria.
One half of the Awards will vest if Plan EPS targets are met and one half will be dependent on the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance.
The minimum increase in Plan EPS will be 2 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
TSR will be measured against the FTSE General Retailers Index with vesting only if the Company is at the median or above.
The following tables illustrate the targets.
Increase in EPS Award as a % of salary Less than 2% nil 2% 5% 3% 10% 4% 15% 5% 20% 6% 25% TSR performance Award as a % of salary Below median nil Median 60th percentile 5% 61st 70th percentile 10% 71st 80th percentile 15% Upper quintile 25% Special Arrangements for the Chief Executive In 2005, the Company introduced special incentive arrangements for the Chief Executive.
These included a three-year share-based Plan which could deliver shares equal in value to three times salary as at 30 June 2005 in June 2008.
Two-thirds of the total award is linked to the Companys TSR performance vs the General Retailers Index.
No vesting will occur unless this performance is at least at the median with a maximum award if the Company performs in the top 20 per cent of this peer group.
The remaining one-third of the total award will vest provided that the Chief Executive is still employed by the Company on 30 June 2008 and conditional on him retaining his existing shareholding in the Company until that date.
The number of shares awarded was based on a price of 36.2p per share being the average share price over the period of one month prior to 30 June 2005.
No new shares will be issued in respect of this Plan.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Directors Remuneration Report 29 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 3 February 2007 Special Share Award for Tony Page As part of the package agreed when Tony Page joined the Company, he received an Award of shares equal in value to 300,000.
The number of shares awarded was based on a share price of 31.5p per share being the share price on 1 September 2006.
This Award will vest on 31 August 2009, provided that he remains in employment with the Company.
This Award, and the cash payment of 150,000 made in April 2007, were made partly to compensate Mr Page for incentives with his previous employer which he forfeited when he joined the Company.
Management Investment Plan for Senior Executives A Management Investment Plan was established in June 2005, which provides the directors of subsidiary companies and selected members of senior management 52 individuals in total with an opportunity to invest their own money in the Companys shares.
No Executive Directors participate in the Plan.
The maximum investment for each individual was dependent on their grade and the highest amount that a director of a subsidiary company could invest was 20,000.
Over 500,000 was invested in total and participants will become entitled to awards of matching shares each year for three years, provided that profit targets are met and that the participant does not dispose of any of the purchased shares.
At the first anniversary of the initial investment a matching share award of 50 per cent of the shares purchased was made which will vest on 30 June 2008.
The profit targets set in 2005 and 2006 have not been met but a further matching award will become due on 30 June 2008, if a target for the year ending 2 February 2008 is met.
All the share allocations will be released to participants who remain employed in the Group after three years and the Company will not issue any new shares in respect of this Plan.
Performance Graph The Committee is required to include a graph showing the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the Company against an appropriate index.
The Committee has decided that the General Retailers Index is appropriate and for further comparison, the TSR for companies in the FTSE 250 is also shown.
