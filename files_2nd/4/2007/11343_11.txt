The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr Jack R Fryer Chairman, Mr Ron W Mackintosh appointed on 22 March 2007, Mr J Nicholas Starritt and Sir Stephen J Lander, who are all independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board as a whole, for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits, including performance-related bonus schemes and share incentive plans for the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
Mrs Dina Knight, Human Resources Director, provides advice and information to the Committee when required.
In addition, the law firm Pinsent Masons and Kepler Associates, remuneration consultants, provides advice on the share option schemes and remuneration to the Committee as and when required.

The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year.
Remuneration policy Objectives The objectives of the remuneration policy for Executive Directors are: the total remuneration package should be competitive to attract, motivate and retain Directors of a high calibre: remuneration should be a combination of performance-driven cash and equity-based rewards in addition to base salary and benefits: and performance-driven rewards should potentially form a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and align the interests of the Executives with those of the shareholders.
The graph below shows as a percentage the components of Directors remuneration for the year ended 30 April 2007.

The overall remuneration package can consist of a base salary, annual bonus, pension rights, share options and car, medical and life assurance benefits.
It is the policy of the Committee to review the remuneration package offered to the Directors on an ongoing basis and make recommendations for changes where it is considered appropriate.
Performance-related pay represents a significant proportion of the total remuneration package.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are set in line with market rates.
Base Salary In setting the base salary for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the Directors experience, performance and responsibilities both internally and in comparison to similar companies in the IT sector.
Each Directors base salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Annual Bonus Bonuses are determined by reference to base salary, the achievement of the annual operating plan agreed by the full Board each year, the successful completion of specific corporate objectives and the attainment of a number of personal stretch targets.
Our target bonuses are set at 50% of basic salary but individuals may achieve a higher percentage for over-performance.
Conversely, underperformance could result in a lower amount or no bonus being awarded.
It is the policy of the Committee to keep under review the objectives set and the proportions of base salary payable.
The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to a cash bonus.
Pension and other benefits The Executive Directors of Northgate Information Solutions plc are entitled to become members of the Groups pension scheme, details of which are set out in note 20, or to have comparable pension contributions made to a personal pension scheme on their behalf.
No pension contributions are made on behalf of the Non-Executive Directors.
Other benefits provided consist of a car or allowance towards vehicle running costs, and medical life assurance benefits.
Directors also have the opportunity to participate in the Companys flexible benefits programme My Choice.
Pension and other benefits provided are subject to regular review by the Company to ensure that they remain attractive and competitive.
Share Incentives The Company currently has two share plans which are open to new grants:- The Northgate 2006 Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan which replaces the Northgate 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme: and The Northgate 2006 Approved Executive Share Option Plan the Approved Plan that allows tax-approved options to be granted up to the statutory limit currently 30,000.
Under the Performance Share Plan, an individual will be granted a right to receive shares for no cost which will normally vest after three years, subject to continued employment and the achievement of stretching performance targets.
The Approved Plan is a standard HMRC-approved share option plan.
All of the Company's share plans operate within a 15% dilution limit which was endorsed by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The Company will manage its remaining capacity within this limit carefully and will use both new issue shares and shares purchased in the market to satisfy awards.
The Company is committed to working towards the more usual 10% dilution limit for share plans which the Company anticipates will be achieved in the near future as a significant number of options are expected to be exercised within the next 2-3 years.
The Performance Targets applied to initial awards made under the Performance Share Plan are a mix of challenging Earnings per Share EPS growth targets for half of the award and a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR target for the other half of the award.
These Performance Targets will apply separately to the shares to which they relate.
The Performance Targets are considered by the Committee to be demanding and have been chosen to reward executives for increasing shareholder return and improving financial performance.
The Performance Periods will be three years from the award date for the TSR performance target and three financial years for the EPS performance target, beginning with the financial year in which the award is granted.
NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 35 Awards will vest on the following basis, with no subsequent retesting after the end of the respective performance periods: Performance EPS Target TSR Target Potential level 50% of award 50% of award reward TSR performance of a Northgate Percentage of total award that Compound Annual Growth Rate of share compared to TSR will vest on achievement of the Relative Benchmark Northgate EPS in excess of inflation performance of the FTSE EPS Target or the TSR Target over 3 years techMARK 100 Index over 3 years Upper quartile 12% pa or more Index performance plus 11% 50% pa compound or more Between median and upper Between 3% pa and 12% pa Between Index performance and Between 12.5% and 50% on a quartile Index performance plus 11% pa straight line basis compound Median 3% pa At Index performance 12.5% Below median Less than 3% pa Less than Index performance Nil In the event that a participant receives an award over shares worth more than 100% of basic salary in any financial year, the proportion of that award that will vest at the median performance level will be 10%.
For the purposes of the performance targets, EPS will be adjusted basic EPS as reported in the Group's statutory accounts.
The Company's TSR will be compared to the TSR performance of the FTSE techMARK 100 Index.
TSR will be averaged over the 3 months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period.
The Committee will review the continuing appropriateness of these Performance Targets in future years.
The Committee will endeavour to set the EPS and TSR targets at the relative benchmark performance levels shown in the above table with upper quartile performance being required over a 3-year period for all awards to vest.
Service Contracts For Executive Directors, it is the policy of the Company that service contracts do not have notice periods by the Company in excess of one year and by the Executive Directors in excess of six months.
The contracts are ongoing with no fixed termination date.
On early termination, the Company is entitled to make payments to the Executive Director of sums equal to the value of his salary and other benefits in lieu of the required period of notice.

b Transfer values F and G have been calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
c The value of net increase D represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year end for Mr J R Stier, Mr M S Aldis and Mr D J Meaden.
It is based on the accrued pension increase B after deducting the Directors contributions.
d The change in the transfer value E includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements.

f The Directors benefits are based on uncapped pensionable salary figures, as the Company has agreed to augment their benefits.
The compounding takes as a base notional earnings of 6.54 million for the year to December 1997. b As agreed with shareholders, the exercise of 40% of these options is not subject to specific performance conditions.
Dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging between at least 35 pence and 55 pence over a six-month period prior to exercise, proportions of the remaining options are exercisable up to a maximum of 60%.
c The exercise of these options is dependent on the average mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six-month period prior to exercise exceeding 75 pence, and whether certain business unit growth targets for the 2001 2002 financial year compared to the preceding financial year were achieved.
d The exercise of these options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging at least 75 pence over a sixmonth period prior to exercise.
e Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six-month period prior to exercise exceeding 55 pence.
Exercise of 20% of the options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six-month period prior to exercise exceeding 65 pence.
Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six-month period prior to exercise exceeding 75 pence.
All exercises are further dependent on whether certain business unit profit targets for the 2001 2002 financial year were achieved.
f Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on whether certain business unit contribution targets for 2002 2003 were achieved.
Exercise of proportions of the remaining 60% of the options is further dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six-month period prior to exercise averaging between at least 55 pence and 75 pence.
g Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on the adjusted EPS of the Group as calculated in the 2001 2002 accounts growing at a compound rate greater than 15% per annum by the date that the options become exercisable.
Exercise of proportions of the remaining options are further dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging between at least 55 pence and 75 pence over a six-month period prior to exercise.
NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 41 h Exercise of 40% of the options is dependent on exceeding certain business unit performance measures compared to budget for 2003 04.
Exercise of proportions of the remaining 60% of the options is further dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares over a six-month period prior to exercise averaging between at least 40 pence and 60 pence.
i The exercise of 40% of the options is not subject to specific performance conditions.
Dependent on the mid-market price of the Companys shares averaging between at least 40 pence and 60 pence over a six-month period prior to exercise, proportions of the remaining options are exercisable up to a maximum of 60%.
j The exercise of these options is dependent on the Companys shares showing a Cumulative Total Shareholder Return of at least 8% plus RPI per year within three years of the date of grant, using the Option Price as the starting point.
For the purposes of this condition, Cumulative Total Shareholder Return can be the increase in Share Price, the value of the dividend s per share paid or a combination of the two.
Whether this condition is met will be determined by taking the highest consecutive 90-day average mid-market closing share price over the three years and adding any dividend per share paid in the same period.
Performance conditions for those options granted on 17 December 2003 had been satisfied during the three-year period since grant.
Options granted on 29 January 2004, which had likewise been issued at the time of the Rebus acquisition, contained similar performance conditions which were subject to revision by the Remuneration Committee.
Following consultation with RREV and with the support of the Companys major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee agreed to amend the performance conditions attaching to those options granted on 29 January 2004 such that the period over which the performance conditions are measured would be extended to four years and that the Cumulative Total Shareholder Return of 8% plus RPI per year would also apply to the fourth year from grant.
k As agreed with shareholders, share awards under the Performance Share Plan are 50% dependent upon the Companys shares showing a Total Shareholder Return TSR of at least 11% per annum above the TSR performance of the FTSE techMARK 100 Index over a three-year vesting period and 50% dependent upon a compound annual growth rate in adjusted basic EPS of the Group of more than 12% above RPI in respect of the same three-year vesting period.
The interests in share options detailed above include those of the Director and his immediate family.
These performance conditions are considered appropriate because they provide challenging but achievable targets in order to incentivise the holder to work towards and achieve the expectations of the Company and its shareholders.
In assessing whether the performance conditions have been met, the Remuneration Committee considers whether the criteria for successful completion of each individual condition have been achieved or exceeded.
These methods of assessment were chosen because they provide a clearly-defined process for the Remuneration Committee to determine successful completion of each condition and are consistent with other performance monitoring procedures used within the Company as a whole.
The market price of the Companys shares at 30 April 2007 was 87.75p and the range during the year ended 30 April 2007 was 66.75p to 95.00p.
Since the year-end, the Company has acquired a majority interest in ARINSO International NV.
Under the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Company has agreed to grant in aggregate 10 million share awards to certain senior executives and managers in accordance with the rules of the Performance Share Plan.
The Register of Directors Interests contains full details of Directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares and is available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company.
