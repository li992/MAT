34 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2006 07 9 Directors service contracts The disclosures required by the Regulations in respect of Directors service contracts are as follows: Jean-Nol Labroue Mr Labroues service contract dated 13 June 2003 is covered by the applicable French collective Bargaining Agreement in force within Kesa Electricals SAS from time to time, which sets certain of his terms and conditions of employment.
Mr Labroue also participates in mandatory French retirement benefit arrangements.
In line with French practice, Mr Labroues pensionable salary is the annual gross remuneration received by him over the three preceding years, excluding profit sharing plans, any termination payments and any exceptional compensation received by him.
Under his service contract, Mr Labroues employment may be terminated on not less than six months notice given by either party.
Kesa Electricals SAS may require Mr Labroue not to serve out his notice but in that case Kesa Electricals SAS must maintain his contractual remuneration and benefits save for bonus and incentive arrangements during the notice period.
In addition to notice, if certain conditions are met, Kesa Electricals SAS may be required under French law to make a further payment to Mr Labroue as compensation for the termination of his employment.
This payment is not likely to exceed 12 months remuneration.
In addition, Mr Labroues service contract provides that if during the 12 months immediately following a change of control of Kesa Electricals, Kesa Electricals SAS gives Mr Labroue notice of termination of his employment other than cause he is entitled to receive a liquidated damages payment equivalent to 12 months remuneration.
For these purposes, one months remuneration for Mr Labroue is calculated by reference to his annual basic salary at the time including the allowance for his travel outside France, and such bonus and benefits provided to him in the 12 months prior to the month in which the change of control occurs.
Any amounts payable under French law to Mr Labroue on any termination of his employment count towards the liquidated damages payment and are not deducted from the contractual obligations.
Simon Herrick Simon Herrick has a service contract with Kesa Electricals plc dated 15 March 2005.
Mr Herricks service contract provides for an annual basic salary currently 360,500 per annum, a travel allowance, pension benefits and private medical insurance.

Under his service contract, Mr Herricks employment can be terminated on not less than 12 months notice given by Kesa Electricals or not less than six months notice from Mr Herrick.
In the case of notice given by Kesa Electricals, a payment may be made in lieu of the unexpired portion of notice and Kesa Electricals can reduce the payment to take into account the receipt of a lump sum and mitigation.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2006 07 35 Report on Directors remuneration and related matters 10 Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts and their appointment may be terminated at any time without compensation.

12 Shareholding guideline It is one of the tenets of Kesas reward strategy that shareholders and Directors interests be aligned.
To reinforce this, the Remuneration Committee expects that over a period of years Executive Directors will build a personal holding in Kesa shares.
To underpin this commitment, the Committee expects that, while the guideline holding remains unfulfilled, Executive Directors will not dispose of any shares vesting to them under any of the Kesa incentive plans save for any disposals necessary to meet tax liabilities arising from them, until they hold shares worth the following percentage of their base salary.
