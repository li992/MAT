REMUNERATION REPORT remuneration report Overview During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed its remuneration policy to ensure that it remains consistent with market and best practice.
The broad conclusion of this review was that the structure of the remuneration packages continues to be appropriate at this time, but some changes have been made and these are described below.
Composition The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Mr K S Beeston Chairman, Mr T M Gateley, Mr L Browne, Ms A M Frew and Mr N B M Askew, the Companys non-executive Chairman.
In accordance with the revised Combined Code, issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006, all of the foregoing non-executive directors were regarded by the Board as independent and Mr Askew was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
Advice received The committee consulted the Chief Executive, Mr M J Lamb, regarding the remuneration of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Mr D M Hurt, the Group Pensions Manager, Mr P Flanagan, and the Company Secretary, Mr J OShea, who acted as secretary to the committee.
Independent remuneration advisers were engaged by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee: Deloitte & Touche LLP until June 2007 and thereafter New Bridge Street Consultants LLP.
These advisers also attended certain meetings at the request of the committee.
During the year Deloitte & Touche LLP also provided due diligence, financial and tax consulting services to the Company and New Bridge Street Consultants provided survey data on non-executive remuneration for the Board.
Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
However, the non-executive Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The Remuneration of the non-executive directors is shown in the table on page 52 and was reviewed in 2007 the last review being in 2005.
For 2007 annual remuneration was as follows: Chairman 195,000, non-executive director 45,000 including committee membership fees and additional remuneration for chairing a committee of 10,000 and for the senior non-executive director of 5,000.
The Board has established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is encouraged to build up a holding of at least 7,500 shares, or 10,000 shares in the case of the Chairman, within a reasonable period of appointment.
All of the non-executives hold the relevant number of shares except that Mr L Browne holds 6,438 shares and he intends to buy the balance during 2008.
The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
The appointment of the Chairman runs for an initial three year term expiring in May 2008 and the Board has agreed a renewal for a further three years.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation and removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter Unexpired term as at Date appointed of appointment 31 December 2007 as a director Mr N B M Askew 28.04.05 4 months 14.05.05 Mr K S Beeston 07.03.05 2 months 08.03.05 Mr L Browne 16.12.04 N A 01.01.05 Ms A M Frew 16.02.06 1 year 2 months 02.03.06 Mr T M Gateley 30.10.06 1 year 10 months 01.11.03 Standing for re-election at the May 2008 annual general meeting.
Appointments renewed for a further 3 years since the year end.
46 Remuneration report Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potentials for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements or a cash allowance and participation in a deferred bonus plan and a performance share plan.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In this connection the committee considered benchmarking data prepared by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also has regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The committee has the discretion to take account of environmental, social and corporate governance when setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
The charts below show the proportion of executive directors aggregate remuneration which is paid as salary or is performance-related pay based on maximum vesting under the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements mentioned above assuming reinvestment of half of annual bonus payments in the deferred bonus plan and excluding the impact of changes in share price.
This supports the committees policy that a significant proportion of remuneration should be performance related.
Maximum performance pay Maximum performance pay Maximum performance pay Chief Executive Finance Director Executive Director 23% Salary 26% Salary 29% Salary 77% 74% 71% Performance pay Performance pay Performance pay Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
Contractual retirement age for directors was changed from 60 to 65 in 2006 in response to the new age discrimination law.
These contracts do not include any specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minima, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
IMI plc Annual Report 2007 47 REMUNERATION REPORT remuneration report The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date joined Date of Date of service Notice period Period to normal Group appointment contract retirement age as to Board at 31 December 2007 M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 24.01.08 12 months 17 years 1 month D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 12 months 13 years 6 months D C Nicholas 08.03.04 08.03.04 01.10.06 12 months 7 years R M Twite 26.09.88 01.02.07 01.02.07 12 months 24 years 5 months W R Whitney 03.08.87 01.03.04 01.03.04 N A N A retired on 31 January 2007 Base salary Salary reviews for the executive directors are conducted annually with any increases effective from 1 January.
Salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account external benchmark data, the executives role, responsibilities and individual performance and pay conditions elsewhere in the Company.
The normal policy is to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges for each role.
The salaries for the executive directors effective from 1 January 2008 are: M J Lamb - 656,000.
Annual bonus Executive directors are awarded annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
The annual bonus targets for 2007 related to operating profit before restructuring, investigation costs, intangible amortisation and other income, organic revenue growth and working capital.
These measures also apply to the 2008 bonus, a proportion of which is discretionary.
50% of any bonus paid must be taken in the form of deferred shares deferred for three years.
The maximum annual bonus potential for 2007 was 100% of salary.
During 2007 operating profit increased by 10%, organic revenue growth was 6.7% but the working capital efficiency target was not met.
On this basis the Remuneration Committee determined that bonuses in respect of 2007 be 79.9% of salary 2006: 88%, of which half must be put into the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are non-pensionable in the case of all executive directors.
The changes to annual bonus policy that will apply in 2008 are: 1.
The annual bonus maximum for the Chief Executive will be 75% of salary in the form of a cash payment and 75% of salary in the form of deferred shares.
The Finance Directors annual bonus maximum will be 62.5% of salary cash bonus and 62.5% of salary deferred share bonus.
The on-target bonus levels will be set at 40% of the bonus maximum for the Chief Executive and at 48% for the Finance Director: this compares to 50% for both in 2007.
The 2008 targets required to achieve the higher bonus maxima have been made more stretching relative to the 2007 targets so as to ensure that the Company is not paying more for the same level of performance.
A committee power to reduce or to delay the payment of annual bonuses in exceptional circumstances has been introduced.
An element of the bonus is payable at the discretion of the committee reflecting other financial and non-financial performance.
48 Remuneration report Long term incentive arrangements Overview The Company operates two executive share plans: 1. the Deferred Bonus Plan which is a co-investment arrangement: and 2. the Performance Share Plan which is a conventional long term incentive plan.
Deferred Bonus Plan The Deferred Bonus Plan DBP runs in conjunction with the annual bonus plan for executive directors and was approved by shareholders at the 2005 annual general meeting.
Under the DBP, at least one half of each executive directors earned annual bonus is mandatorily deferred for three years and delivered in shares in the Company.
The executive may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remaining 50% of their annual bonus.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 100% of the deferred bonus at the entry share price level or 125% for the Chief Executive if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.
The awards are subject to economic profit, also known as economic value added EVA, based performance conditions.
EVA has been chosen as the performance measure because it combines profitability with return on capital in a single measure and is being used across the Group as a management decision-making tool.
The EVA performance conditions attached to the awards are tiered with linear progression within each band.
The calculation of EVA is based on operating profit after tax, with appropriate adjustment for restructuring costs, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reflecting IMIs cost of capital.
Further details of the performance conditions attaching to the awards are set out in the notes to the table on page 55.
No changes are being made to the DBP for 2008.
Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP was also introduced in 2005 with shareholder approval and allows for share-based awards worth up to the normal policy maximum of 100% of annual salary.
Details of the awards made under the PSP are contained in the table of directors awards on page 54.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
One half is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition and the other half to a comparative total shareholder return TSR target.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believes it works well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
Details of the performance conditions attached to awards granted under the PSP are shown in the notes to the table on page 54.
Changes which will apply to awards made in 2008 are: 1.
The TSR comparator group has been widened and includes more international companies.
This supports the committees policy to be competitive on an international basis.
A list of the proposed companies is given below.
There will be straight line vesting between median and upper quartile as the vesting schedule has been simplified by removing the previous mid-point.
The financial underpin to the TSR condition has been extended so that the Remuneration Committee can consider more financial indicators than just EPS.
Reflecting the international scope of the plan the EPS range will be set by using absolute growth figures rather than by reference to the UK retail prices index.
The threshold vesting level commences at 25% rather than 30%.
IMI plc Annual Report 2007 49 REMUNERATION REPORT remuneration report The new 2008 international comparator group for the relative TSR target is expected to comprise the following 42 companies: Name Country Name Country Amada Japan Invensys United Kingdom Atlas Copco A Sweden Johnson Matthey United Kingdom BBA Aviation United Kingdom Manitowoc United States Bodycote International United Kingdom Meggitt United Kingdom Borgwarner United States Metso Corporation Finland Charter United Kingdom NSK Japan Cobham United Kingdom Parker-Hannifin United States Cookson Group United Kingdom Pentair United States Eaton United States Rotork United Kingdom Emerson Electric United States Sandvik AB Sweden Enodis United Kingdom Seco Tools B Sweden Fanuc Japan SKF B Sweden FKI United Kingdom SMC Japan Flowserve Corp United States Spectris United Kingdom GKN United Kingdom Spirax-Sarco Engineering United Kingdom Halma United Kingdom Sulzer AG Switzerland Heidelberg Druck Germany THK Japan Honeywell United States Tomkins United Kingdom IDEX Corp United States Tyco International United States Illinois Tool Works United States Weir Group United Kingdom Ingersoll-Rand United States Yaskawa Electric Japan Country is shown as country of primary listing.
If, at the end of the three-year period, the Company is ranked median in the comparator group, then 25% of the TSRdependent awards will vest.
If the Company is ranked in the upper quartile top 25% of the comparator group, then the TSR-dependent awards will vest in full.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Companys TSR performance is between these two points.
If the Companys TSR performance is below the median, the TSR dependent awards will lapse without retesting.
To ensure that TSR reflects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the financial performance of the Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as calculated under the TSR condition.
50 Remuneration report The performance condition for the second 50% of the 2008 PSP awards is based on the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth over a three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
For the 2008 PSP awards, 25% will vest if compound earnings per share growth is 6% per annum during the three-year performance period: all will vest if the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth is 15% per annum or higher: and awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Companys EPS growth is between these points.
The EPS measure for PSP awards is based on IFRS earnings per share subject to certain adjustments including the elimination in whole or in part of restructuring costs, investigation costs, intangible amortisation, other income and the change in fair value of financial instruments and derivatives.
Share ownership guidelines Executive directors who are eligible to participate in the DBP and the PSP, are encouraged to acquire and maintain a shareholding in the Company with a value equal to 100% of their annual salary, within three years of appointment or June 2008 for those in office in 2005 when the guidelines were introduced.
During the year the committee reviewed this guideline and agreed some practical aspects on how it will be monitored.
Progress as at 31 December 2007 on meeting the guideline is as follows: Executive director Level of share ownership Date to meet guideline at 31.12.07 share price and 2007 salary.
M J Lamb 102.78% 30.06.08 D M Hurt 35.39% 01.07.09 D C Nicholas 105.74% 30.06.08 R M Twite 32.58% 01.02.10 SAYE plan The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20 per cent below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
All Employee Share Ownership Plan The UK-based executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
In May 2008 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 0.75% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2007.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Eligible employees are also able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan, although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
Pension entitlement UK-based executive directors except for Mr D M Hurt participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 65, although Mr M J Lamb and Mr D C Nicholas may elect to retire and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without any actuarial discount and Mr R M Twite may retire at any time after age 60 without actuarial discount.
On death after retirement a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension for Mr M J Lamb and Mr D C Nicholas, and 50% of the members pension for Mr R M Twite.
Should Mr M J Lamb or Mr D C Nicholas die within the first five years of retirement a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years' pension payments.
For Mr R M Twite the dependants pension is increased to 100% of the members pension for the remainder of the five year period.
IMI plc Annual Report 2007 51 REMUNERATION REPORT remuneration report Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5%, in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
Mr M J Lamb 'opted-out' of the IMI Pension Fund in April 2006 and receives a cash allowance equal to 35% of his basic salary instead of accrual for future service from that date, although accrued benefits generally continue to be linked to final salary inflation and Fund benefits were preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death-in-service and termination after age 50 including where twelve months termination notice is given by the Company after age 49 for redundancy or otherwise at the Companys instance.
Mr D M Hurt and Mr R M Twite each received a cash allowance equal to 35% of their basic salary instead of pension benefits Mr R M Twite having 'opted-out' of the IMI Pension Fund from 31 January 2007, retaining a deferred pension in respect of pensionable service to that date.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new appointments will be flexible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of defined benefits, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would not be to offer defined benefits to new executive directors.
Mr W R Whitney was a US-based executive director and during the year was a member of two pension arrangements in the US.
The first was a defined contribution arrangement, the IMI 401 k Plan and during the period 1 January 2007 to 31 January 2007 employer contributions of 893 were made to this plan 2006: 4,757.
The second arrangement was a defined benefit arrangement, the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
His pension is payable without actuarial reduction from age 60, there are no pension increases provided under the Plan and on death a dependants pension equal to the members pension is payable.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
Mr M J Lamb was appointed a non-executive director of Severn Trent Water plc on 29 February 2008.
2 Mr Hurt was employed from 1 May 2006 and appointed as a director on 1 July 2006.
3 Mr Twite was appointed as a director on 1 February 2007.
4 Mr Whitney retired as a director on 31 January 2007 and retired as an employee on 31 July 2007.
All of his remuneration was provided in US Dollars.
52 Remuneration report Half of the bonus and all of the LTIP payments shown above must be invested in the relevant share matching arrangement as described above in the case of all eligible executive directors.
Remuneration shown above as salaries for non-executive directors includes fees of 203,000 2006: 169,000.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by any director in 2007 and none was payable in respect of the retirement of Mr W R Whitney.
Benefits in kind provided to executive directors consist of the provision of private health care arrangements, life insurance and All Employee Share Ownership Plan awards.
A fully expensed motor car was provided for Mr W R Whitney.
All other executive directors elected for a cash alternative scheme, instead of a company car.
Sums paid by way of taxable allowances in the above table include cash allowances instead of company car and pension benefits and in the case of Mr D M Hurt, who joined the Company during 2006, a relocation allowance of 90,000 in the prior year.
Summary of directors pension arrangements Details of the pension benefits earned in the IMI Pension Fund or the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are summarised in the following table: Name Age at Pensionable Accrued Increase Increase Transfer Transfer Difference Value of 31.12.07 service pension in accrued in accrued value of value of between increase to 31.12.07 at pension pension accrued accrued transfer in accrued 31.12.07 over the over the pension pension values at pension at year year at at 31.12.06 31.12.07 net of 31.12.07 31.12.06 and net of inflation 31.12.07 inflation Years 000 pa 000 pa 000 pa 000 000 000 000 M J Lamb 47 20 259 19 10 3,316 2,949 367 128 D C Nicholas 58 4 31 10 9 657 466 191 192 R M Twite 40 18 53 - - 433 428 5 - W R Whitney 57 19 109 2 2 1,362 1,338 24 29 or as at earlier date of ceasing to be a director.

appointed 1 February 2007. ceased to be a director 31 January 2007.
All relevant benefits were provided in US Dollars.
The accrued pension benefits at the end of the year 31 January 2007 for Mr W R Whitney represent the annual deferred pension to which each executive director would have been entitled had he left service at the end of the year.
This is based on completed pensionable service and pensionable earnings at the relevant date.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year reflects the completion of further pensionable service and the increase in pensionable earnings, both before and after inflation.
The above figures exclude any benefits from the executive directors voluntary contributions.
Transfer values calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are also shown in the table.
A transfer value is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its defined benefit pension schemes see note 20 to the financial statements on pages 91 to 95, the aggregate value of the accrued benefits as at 31 December 2007 for the executive directors was 7.83million 2006: 8.65million.
Mr W R Whitney ceased to be a director in January 2007 and retired as an employee in July 2007.
His accrued pension benefits reflect his earnings and service at the date of leaving as described above and no additional pension entitlements will arise as a result.
b EPS growth of 6%, 12% and 24% above RPI, respectively, for awards worth one, two and three times salary at option price.
c 50% of award based on comparative TSR with an EPS underpin with vesting at median 30% vests to upper quartile full vesting and 50% based on real annual EPS growth of between 3% 30% vests to 12% full vesting per annum for 2007 and 2006 awards and 15% for 2005 awards.
For details of the TSR comparator group used for 2005 and 2006 awards please refer to the 2006 Remuneration Report.
The award price is the exercise price for awards structured as options and the price used to calculate the number of shares for PSP awards to UK participants in the PSP which are structured as deferred share awards or nil cost options and, in each case, is determined by reference to an average middle market quotation without discount.
Notional gains on share options exercised shown in the above are based on the mid-market price at the date of exercise.
The closing price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2007 was 393.75p per share and the price range during the year was 637p to 387.25p.
Mr W R Whitney retired from the Board in January 2007.
54 Remuneration report The first PSP awards were made in 2005 and based on performance for the period 2005-2007 will vest on 13 May 2008 at 50% of maximum nil vesting for the TSR element and full vesting for the EPS element.

a Performance of the Group in relation to economic profit will be measured over the years 2006-2008.
Vesting is tiered with linear progression in each band as follows: 0% to 20% of maximum maximum being a 125% match for the Chief Executive and a 100% match for other executive directors for positive economic profit up to 100 million, 20% to 50% for 100 million to 150 million, 50% to 85% for 150 million to 200 million and 85% to 100% for 200 million to 210 million economic profit.
b Performance of the Group in relation to economic value added will be measured over the years 2007-2009.
Vesting is tiered with linear progression in each band as follows: 0% to 20% of maximum maximum being a 125% match for the Chief Executive and a 100% match for other executive directors for positive economic value added up to 185 million, 20% to 50% for 185 million to 275 million, 50% to 85% for 275 million to 365 million and 85% to 100% for 365 million to 385 million economic value added.
Mr Whitney retired from the Board prior to the 2006 award being made and therefore received his payment in cash.
