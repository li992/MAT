As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the 2008 Annual General Meeting 2008 AGM.
Remuneration Committee During the year under review, the members of the Committee were Alex Walker Chairman, Ian Brindle, Gerard Eastman who stepped down on 1 October and Duncan Lewis with effect from 1 July.
The composition of the Committee became compliant with the Code in terms of independent non-executive directors from 1 October following a review of Committee membership.
The Committee met three times during the year under review and each meeting was fully attended by the Committees members.
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of the Board, all elements of the remuneration of the Chairman, executive directors and senior managers, reviewing remuneration policy and overseeing the operation of the Companys share incentive plans.
The Committees full terms of reference can be found on the Companys website www.
Remuneration policy Following the changes in Board and Committee composition in December 2006, the Companys remuneration policy was reviewed.
Following this exercise, the primary aim of the Committee during the year under review and for subsequent years is to ensure that remuneration aligns the interests of key executives with shareholders and reinforces behaviour which will lead to the continued long term development of the business.
This is achieved by ensuring the remuneration for key executives is competitive when compared with companies of similar size, type and complexity and is structured so that a substantial proportion of the total remuneration package is linked to growth and profitability targets.
Advisers to the Committee When the Committee considers it appropriate, it takes advice on remuneration matters from: Aon Consulting Inc - Radford executive remuneration data: Ernst & Young LLP - independent verification of Earnings per Share EPS to determine the vesting of share incentives they are also the Companys auditors : Kepler Associates Ltd - measurement of Total Shareholder Return TSR to determine the vesting of share incentives: and Linklaters LLP - advice on share incentive plans they are also one of the Companys general legal advisers.
During the period under review, the Committee also consulted with the Companys Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and the Company Secretary but not on matters relating to their own remuneration or contracts.
Executive directors remuneration The remuneration of executive directors during the year under review comprised the following elements: base salary, benefits and pension contribution or cash allowance in lieu of pension: annual performance bonus: and long term share incentive awards.
a Edward Bramson, Executive Chairman Mr Bramson has chosen to waive his right to any remuneration for his role as Executive Chairman.
As a consequence he receives no directors fees, salary or pension contributions.
He also does not participate in the Annual Performance Bonus Scheme or in any share incentive programmes.
32 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 33 Report on directors remuneration continued b Base salary, fees and benefits Salaries for executive directors are determined by the Committee and are reviewed annually, normally on 1 January, taking into account individual responsibilities, performance and prevailing market rates for executives of similar status in comparable companies.
Pension contributions and other benefits are also reviewed annually having regard to competitor practice.
Benefits normally include a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance cover.
During the year under review, Eric Hutchinson received an annual cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20 per cent of base salary, totalling 58,970 2006 24,571.
During 2006, Eric Hutchinson transferred the value of his accrued benefits from the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension and Life Assurance Plan the Staff Plan to a personal pension arrangement.
The transfer payment of 3,984,844 was made pursuant to an enhanced transfer value offer which was made to all active and deferred members of the Staff Plan.
Prior to the transfer, Eric Hutchinson participated in the non-contributory funded senior executive level of the Staff Plan, a defined benefit arrangement which would have provided him at normal retirement age of 60, and dependent on length of service, with a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, subject to HM Revenue & Customs limits and other statutory conditions.
It also provided for dependants pensions and a cash lump sum on death.
From 1 August 2006 to his termination of employment, Anders Gustafsson received an annual cash allowance in lieu of pension of 30 per cent of total base salary which was paid in the US and for 2007 totalled $51,682 25,841 2006 $114,263, 60,950.
Prior to 1 August 2006, Anders Gustafssons contract provided him with a pension contribution of 30 per cent of base salary.
Subject to statutory limits, and in accordance with his instruction, the Company made approved contributions into the Executive Section of the Spirent Retirement Cash and Life Assurance Plan the Cash Plan.
The Executive Section of the Cash Plan is non-contributory and provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.
Contributions to the Cash Plan are held in an individual account and invested in accordance with member elections.
The Company established an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB on a defined contribution basis to which the balance of contributions in excess of the statutory limits were credited together with interest on the UURB balance.
Following his relocation to the US, the accrued UURB balance of 263,955 was cashed out, 237,232 being paid in cash to Mr Gustafsson after deduction of tax and 26,723 being paid into the Cash Plan.
Further details of pension contributions and payments are given in paragraphs 8 a and 8 b. c Annual performance bonus The Committee reviewed the Annual Performance Bonus Scheme targets and performance conditions to incentivise key executives to meet the short term strategic objectives of the Company.
During 2007, Eric Hutchinson participated in the Annual Performance Bonus Scheme which, for him, was structured so that performance was measured against growth targets in the Companys EPS together with personal objectives.
The Committee reviewed his performance against the targets set and having exceeded the EPS target and attained his personal objectives, the Committee approved a cash bonus payable for 2007 of 100,000, equivalent to 34 per cent of base salary.
d Long term share incentive awards The Company operates a number of share incentive plans.
Currently, executive directors are able to participate in the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP, which is a discretionary share plan, and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is an all employee share plan.
There were no grants made to executive directors under either of these plans during the year under review.
During 2007, grants of options remained outstanding under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and the UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, in which executive directors have participated in the past.
These share schemes were both replaced in 2005 by the EIP and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme respectively and hence no grants have been made under either scheme since then.
34 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 35 Further details on all the Companys share plans are provided in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements and note 16 to the parent Company financial statements.
2005 Employee Incentive Plan Any awards made to executive directors are subject to prior satisfactory performance of the individual and award levels vary in accordance with the individuals potential to add value to the business over the medium to long term.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant options and share-settled stock appreciation rights SARs, the vesting of which would be subject to meeting an EPS growth target.
Performance shares may also be granted, the vesting of which would be subject to meeting a TSR performance target.
These performance criteria reflected UK market practice in long term incentive plans at the time the EIP was approved by shareholders in April 2005.
In normal circumstances, the maximum combined award under the EIP is limited to 250 per cent of salary face value in SARs options.
As explained above, grants would normally consist partly of SARs options and partly of performance shares, with the proviso that the performance share element does not exceed a face value of 100 per cent of salary ie using the ratio of two SARs options being equivalent to one performance share.
All EIP awards are tested once on or shortly following the third anniversary of grant.
Any part of an award which does not vest will lapse and there is no retesting.
Executive directors would normally receive a mix of SARs options and performance shares, utilising a ratio of two SARs options being equivalent to one performance share.
At least 25 per cent of each grant is delivered in SARs options and at least 25 per cent in performance shares, with the balance of the grant delivered through a mix of SARs options and performance shares as determined by the Committee.
In normal circumstances, SARs options under the EIP vest three years after being granted, provided the Companys EPS growth targets after excluding inflation have been met over a three year performance period.
The growth targets in respect of awards made to executive directors during 2005 and 2006 required that the Companys EPS increased within a range of 6 per cent per annum for 25 per cent vesting and 15 per cent per annum for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
In normal circumstances, performance shares under the EIP vest three years following grant provided the Companys TSR targets have been met over a three year performance period.
TSR is defined as the growth in the value of a share or index, assuming dividends and other distributions are reinvested.
This performance condition requires that Spirents relative TSR rating be between the median of a comparator group for 30 per cent vesting and in the upper quartile of a comparator group for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
The comparator group consists of the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those companies who were also constituents of the FTSE 100 Index at the commencement of the performance period.
The Committee considers the selected comparator group as providing a suitable benchmark for Spirents TSR rating.
In determining the TSR for the Company and its comparator group, share prices are taken at a fixed point immediately prior to, and at the end of, the performance period, and there is no averaging period.
e Service contracts The Companys policy is that, in normal circumstances, executive directors should have rolling service contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of 12 months notice from the Company to reflect market practice.
Eric Hutchinson entered into a rolling service contract on 13 December 1999 which is terminable by either party on 12 months notice.
All contracts contain provisions for the Company to make payment in lieu of notice and for removal of the director for poor performance or misconduct without compensation.
The Company will seek to apply practical mitigation measures to any payment of compensation on termination, taking into account all relevant circumstances.
All service contracts contain appropriate provisions to protect the legitimate interests of the Company with respect to preventing any terminated director from working in a business which competes against the Company.
Service contracts do not contain any compensation rights which could be increased on a change of control in the Company.
34 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2007 35 Report on directors remuneration continued f External appointments The Company recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company.
The individual director retains any related fees.
Eric Hutchinson serves as a non-executive director on the board of Trifast plc and received a fee of 32,500 during the year under review.
g Shareholder dilution and share plan approval sought at 2008 AGM The Committee is mindful of the need to manage shareholder dilution in a responsible manner.
At the 2007 AGM, shareholders granted the Company authority to make discretionary share awards up to a maximum of 0.3 per cent of the issued Ordinary share capital under either the EIP or the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP.
This authority is due to expire at the 2008 AGM.
Between the 2007 AGM and the date of this Report, the Committee approved share awards equating to just 0.13 per cent of the issued Ordinary share capital: less than half of the current authority.
In addition, SARs, which are more efficient in terms of actual dilution as only the appreciation value and not the full value of the award needs to be funded in shares when awards are exercised, are used in lieu of share options.
Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Companys share incentive plans on a rolling 10 year basis has fallen by 1.5 per cent when comparing the positions at 31 December 2007 15.0 per cent and 31 December 2006 16.5 per cent.
The overall number of share incentives outstanding at 31 December 2007 has fallen by 44.7 million when compared to the number outstanding at 31 December 2006 2007 67.1 million, 2006 111.8 million.
However, the Committees efforts to manage shareholder dilution have been significantly offset by the Companys share repurchase programme, as this has resulted in a large drop in the issued Ordinary share capital over the year 2007 792.4 million, 2006 885.6 million.
Ignoring the impact of the share repurchase programme the dilution position at the year end would have been 12.0 per cent, a drop of 4.5 per cent.
In accordance with its sustainable dilution strategy, and to give management flexibility while the Company continues through this transitional period in its development, the Company will seek shareholder authority at the 2008 AGM to award share incentives over new issue shares of no more than half of one per cent of the current issued Ordinary share capital excluding treasury shares up to the 2009 AGM.
At the 2007 AGM, the Company was also given authority by shareholders to continue to operate the SSIP until the 2008 AGM, at which time the Company would revert to shareholders on long term share incentive arrangements following a review of remuneration policy.
As the Company currently remains in a transitional stage of its development, it will seek shareholder authority to further extend the operation of the SSIP until the 2009 AGM at which time the Company will revert to shareholders with an update on long term share incentive arrangements.
Accordingly, a resolution is being placed before shareholders at the 2008 AGM to renew the authority to operate the SSIP and to grant share incentives using new issue shares.
Anders Gustafssons termination of employment Edward Bramson assumed responsibility for the management of the Group by becoming Executive Chairman on 7 March 2007, as a consequence of which the employment of the Chief Executive Officer, Anders Gustafsson, was terminated.
Anders Gustafsson had both a UK and a US service contract which were terminable by the Company on 12 months notice and by him on six months notice.
In agreeing the payments which were made to Anders Gustafsson on the termination of his employment, the Committee took advice in terms of the quantum of the payment having regard to his contractual entitlement.
Agreement was reached with Mr Gustafsson that he receive a total payment of 553,152 being equivalent to 12 months base salary and accrued holiday pay in accordance with his service contracts.
During 2007, Mr Gustafsson was paid 73,885 which was the remaining amount due to him in accordance with a letter agreement entered into in August 2006 relating to his relocation from the UK to the US.
Mr Gustafsson was not paid any of his annual performance bonus for the year under review.
Mr Gustafssons entitlements under the share incentive plans in which he had participated were in accordance with the rules of each plan.
Further details can be found in paragraphs 8 a, 8 b, 9 a and 9 b of this Report.

Executive Chairman and non-executive directors letters of appointment The Companys remuneration policy with regard to non-executive directors is to pay fees which are in line with market practice.
Fees are normally reviewed once every three years and having last been reviewed on 1 January 2005, were reviewed on 1 January 2008.
As a result of the 2008 review it was concluded that non-executive director fees were below market rates and should be brought up to median level for comparable companies.
It was also concluded that the additional responsibilities and time commitment required of the members and chairmen of the Boards Committees should be reflected in fee arrangements.
Accordingly, the Board resolved to increase the basic annual fee for non-executive directors with effect from 1 January 2008 from 33,000 to 36,000.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees would receive an additional fee of 11,000 and 9,000 respectively.
However, Edward Bramson, who was appointed Chairman on 22 December 2006 and Executive Chairman on 7 March 2007, and Gerard Eastman, who was appointed as a non-executive director on 22 December 2006 both partners of Sherborne Investors GP, LLC Sherborne, the Companys largest shareholder, continue to waive their rights to any fees while they manage an operational turnaround of the Company.
The Executive Chairman and non-executive directors each have a letter of appointment with the Company for not more than a three year period, subject to the Companys Articles of Association.
Each letter provides for retirement every three years, except Edward Bramson and Gerard Eastman who have stated that they will seek re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for a pension or other benefits.
No element of their fee is performance related.
