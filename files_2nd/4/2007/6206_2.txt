Foseco plc Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report sets out the membership of the Remuneration Committee and the names of the advisers who provided services to the Committee during the year, together with the policies that have been followed by the Remuneration Committee in determining the elements of executive remuneration.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 DRRR, which sets out statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration.
The DRRR requires the independent auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The Board keeps under review the terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee, which are based on current best practice contained in the model terms of reference set out in the Guidance Note produced by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.
The principal responsibility of the Committee is to determine the framework or broad policy for the Companys executive remuneration and the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, for approval by the Board.
The remuneration of nonexecutive directors is a matter for the Board itself.
Details of the emoluments, bonuses, benefits-in-kind, incentive arrangements, pensions and service contracts applicable to each director who served during the year are given in this report.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee and advisers unaudited information The Committee is made up of three independent non-executive directors.
The Board has determined that the independent non-executive directors were each found to be free from any material business or other relationship with the Company and therefore believes that there are no relationships that could interfere materially with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The members of the Committee during the year were: Mr Einar Lindh Chairman Mr Adrian Auer Dr Raj Rajagopal The Committee consults with the Chief Executive concerning matters of executive remuneration.
The Board has appointed the following external advisers from whom the Committee has received advice during the year: Ashurst Ltip Towers Perrin Executive remuneration Watson Wyatt Executive remuneration Wragge & Co Directors service contracts Statement of the Companys policy on directors remuneration unaudited information The policies operated by the Company during the year are set out below: Executive remuneration The Companys policy on executive remuneration is that the Remuneration Committee and the Board should each satisfy themselves that executives, including executive directors, are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Groups performance.
The Committee has adopted a remuneration policy with the following objectives: performance related remuneration should seek to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders: a significant proportion of remuneration should be based on financial performance in both the short and long term, as well as the individual contributions made by the executive directors: and executive directors should receive a level of remuneration that will attract, motivate and retain individuals of the necessary calibre.
8 Foseco plc Directors Remuneration Report continued The only pensionable element of executive directors remuneration is base salary.
Annual remuneration for executives The Board recognises that one of its key objectives is to grow the value of the business for the benefit of shareholders and that such growth is strongly related, amongst other things, to the degree of motivation and entrepreneurial spirit of senior executives.
Remuneration is provided through a combination of base salaries and annual bonuses that have a direct and proportionate link to total value created for shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that this more closely aligns the interests of shareholders and management whereby executives only receive substantial rewards when they have created high value in the business.
The Company has adopted a pay structure based on the Hay points system that is used to ensure that the remuneration of executives, including the executive directors, is fair and comparable across the Group, allowing for economic differences between countries.
The Hay system provides information about market practice in individual countries linked to job groups that are based on an evaluation of the contents of a specific job.
Salary and benefits are reviewed annually and in 2007 each executive director received an inflationary increase in line with the increases awarded to other UK based employees.
Prior to the acquisition by Cookson Group plc, the Company had a long term incentive plan Ltip.
The performance targets for the Ltip and the annual bonus scheme ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is directly related to actual measurable performance.
Further details of the annual bonus scheme and Ltip are set out on pages 10 and 11.
Non-executive directors fees and Chairmans remuneration During the year a benchmarking exercise was undertaken in respect of the fees paid to the non-executive directors including the Chairman.
As a consequence the Board approved an increase in the base fees and fee for chairmanship of a committee, but removed the entitlement to an additional fee for membership of a committee.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee and is approved by the Board.
The current fees are shown in the table below, and took effect from 1 May 2007.
Base fee Chairman Senior Total of independent Committee director A R Auer 37,000 7,000 5,000 49,000 E Lindh 37,000 7,000 44,000 K Rajagopal 37,000 37,000 F D Rosenkranz 135,000 135,000 Service contracts The Companys policy on directors service contracts is that service contracts and letters of appointment for executive directors normally provide for notice periods of no longer than twelve months.
Notwithstanding the provisions in an executive directors service contract or letter of appointment concerning termination payments, the Company will seek to reduce any compensation that may be payable to reflect the departing directors obligation to mitigate any loss.
External appointments The Companys policy on external appointments is that, with the approval of the Chairman of the Board, executive directors are normally permitted to hold appointments outside of the Company and retain any fees relating thereto.
Retirement benefits Each of the executive directors is a member of the Foseco UK retirement benefit scheme.

10 Foseco plc Directors Remuneration Report continued Long term incentive plan Prior to the acquisition by Cookson Group plc, under the Ltip, selected senior executives including the executive directors within the Group were awarded conditional entitlements to shares in the Company.
The awards under the Ltip were made by the Company on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee and it was intended that awards vesting will be satisfied using shares sourced by the Foseco Employee Benefit Trust.
Each Ltip award had a three year cycle.
The initial market value of the shares over which any such award was made would not exceed the amount of the participants annual base salary, except in exceptional circumstances.
The number or proportion of such award shares that vest and are released to the participant were determined by reference to the extent to which preset targets were met or exceeded.
The targets related to the performance of the Company over a fixed three year period beginning with that in which the award was made.
Performance targets were set by the Company on the advice of the Remuneration Committee at the time the award were made.
The targets were considered to be exacting and provided transparency for both the executives and shareholders.
Ltip awards At 1 Granted Vested Lapsed At 31 Market price on date January 24 April during during December of April 2007 award 2007 2007 period period 2007 Number of shares pence P D Dean 248,306 99,514 - - 347,820 205 D G Hussey 315,022 105,419 - - 420,441 205 J R P Pike 440,033 146,537 - - 586,570 205 L A Plutshack 177,456 91,859 - - 269,315 205 For the April 2007 award, a share value of 205.75p was used to calculate the number of shares to be awarded, being the average of the middle market quotation for the three dealing days prior to the date of grant.
Vesting of awards normally only occur in the event that the Companys total shareholder return TSR during the performance period is at least equivalent to that of the company at the median position in the FTSE AllShare index ignoring investment companies over the same period, and the Companys cumulative cash flow per share is equal to or greater than targets set at the time of each award.
For the grants made in April 2007, awards the following vesting scale was set: Cash flow per share Award vesting pence % 37.1 25 43.4 75 52.0 100 The Committee considers the use of two measures to be appropriate.
The TSR performance measure is dependent on the Companys relative long term share price performance and dividend policy and therefore aligns the interest of directors with that of shareholders.
This is balanced by a key internal measure, CPS, which is critical to the Companys long term success.
The Committee sets CPS targets after considering the Companys historic performance and future plans.
The Committee believes that the targets are reasonable and that the level of CPS required to achieve maximum vesting is suitably demanding.
The mid-market price of a Foseco share as at 31 December 2007 was 283 pence with a range during the year of 181.25 pence to 286.75 pence.
11 Foseco plc Directors Remuneration Report continued In view of the Cookson bid, the Remuneration Committee recommended that Ltip awards should vest in full on court sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement and so no comparison with other companies in the FTSE AllShare index ignoring investment companies has been undertaken for each Ltip award at 31 December 2007.
On a normal ongoing basis, taking into account the Companys view of CPS for the performance period and on the assumption that the Companys TSR would be above the median, it is estimated that the following levels of the awards would vest: Award % expected to vest 2005 100 2006 61 2007 81 The Groups income statement for 2007 includes charges in operating profit for the Ltip based on these vesting levels.
Additional charges reflecting full vesting on completion of the Cookson offer are included in exceptional items.
The Ltip awards vested in full on 1 April 2008 on Court sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement.
The total value for each director of the vested awards was as follows: Value based on share price of 295 pence P D Dean 1,026,069 D G Hussey 1,240,301 J R P Pike 1,730,381 L A Plutshack 794,479 Service contracts unaudited information Mr Paul Dean, Mr David Hussey and Mr Jamie Pike each have a service contract with the Company dated 6 May 2005 and Mr Lee Plutshack has a service contract with the Company dated 30 November 2005.
