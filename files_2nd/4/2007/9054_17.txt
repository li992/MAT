However, the committee felt that this outstanding performance was not being fairly reflected in the outturns from the current incentive arrangements, in particular the low percentage of awards vesting under the LTIP.
As the necessary discretions to correct the situation are outside the process of the committee, the committee will therefore seek shareholders approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting to amend the structure of the LTIP scheme for the future by proposing amendments which intend to make the allocations and performance conditions more appropriate.
Details of the proposed amendments are included with the separate notice of meeting.
