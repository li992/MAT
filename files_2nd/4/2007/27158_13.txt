Directors Remuneration Report The Board has prepared this report, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on page 40.
Remuneration Committee The Company has five non-executive Directors, whose details are set out on pages 4 to 6.
The whole Board fulfils the function of a Remuneration Committee.
The Board has not been provided with advice or services by any person in respect of its consideration of the Directors remuneration although the Directors expect, from time to time, to review the fees paid to the boards of directors of other investment trust companies.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of the Directors, all of whom are non-executive Directors, should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole, and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts in the same AIC UK Growth and Income Sector which also have a similar capital structure and investment objectives.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ending 30 June 2008 and subsequent years.
The Companys policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by him or her.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association, which limit the aggregate of the fees payable to the Directors to 150,000 per annum.
The Companys policy is that fees payable to the Directors should reflect the time spent by them on the Companys affairs and should be sufficient to enable candidates of a high quality to be recruited.
Nonexecutive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The policy of the Board is to review the level of Directors fees from time to time.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, the Remuneration Committee carried out a review of the level of Directors fees and decided that the fees should be increased from their present level of 22,000 for the Chairman, 18,500 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 16,000 for each Director, to 25,000 for the Chairman, 21,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 18,000 for each Director, with effect from 1 July 2007.
Directors and officers liability insurance cover is held by the Company in respect of the Directors.
This insurance is neither a benefit in kind, nor does it form part of the Directors Remuneration.
Directors Service Contracts None of the Directors has a contract of service or contract for services, and a Director may resign by notice in writing to the Board at any time: there are no set notice periods.
All Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years: this period may be varied by mutual consent.
The Articles of Association provide that, at the Annual General Meeting each year, one-third of the Directors for the time being or, if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to onethird shall be subject to retirement by rotation.
Directors, therefore, retire and are subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter are obliged to retire by rotation, and offer themselves for reelection, at least every three years.
Any Director who attains the age of 70 is subject to annual re-election.
No compensation is payable for loss of office, save any arrears of fees which may be due.
