48723 MG Annual Report - Mid 17 4 08 11:42 Page 51 Wellstream Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 | 51 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the Committee since Admission were Chairman Francisco Gros and Sir Graham Hearne: and Pat Murray who was appointed on 10 July 2007.
They are all independent non-executive directors.
Pre IPO, the Committee members were John Kennedy, Marek Gumienny, Nils Stoesser and Gordon Chapman.
They ceased to be members of the Committee on 19 March 2007.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Sir Graham Hearne was awarded share options pre IPO, details of which are given on page 55.
The Committee appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP executive remuneration consulting team to provide advice on market practice and current trends in directors remuneration and benchmarking data.
Deloitte & Touche LLP are the Companys auditors.
The Audit Committee has considered the independence of the auditors in relation to the provision of non-audit services to the Company and has concluded that there is no conflict with its policy set out further in the Audit Committee Report.
The Board approved the Committees Terms of Reference on 19 March 2007 and a revision approved on 14 September 2007.
The Terms of Reference are available to view on the Companys website www.
com Remuneration policy for the executive directors Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for achieving appropriate levels of performance and for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management:  basic annual salary  benefits-in-kind  annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% of basic salary  Performance Share Plan awards, and  pension arrangements.
Executive directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing that the Chairmans permission is sought.
48723 MG Annual Report - Mid 17 4 08 11:42 Page 52 52 | Directors Remuneration Report continued Basic salary An executive directors basic salary is reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information.
Benchmarking data was reviewed which included an all sector analysis of the FTSE 250, other published survey data and comparator groups within the Companys sector.
Executive directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Benefits-in-kind The executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee refers to market practice.
Bonus targets for 2007 were based on a combination of EBIT and Backlog targets.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary for the CEO and 80% of basic salary for the COO and FD.
Maximum bonus payments for the year ended 31 December 2007 were paid as all targets were exceeded.
Performance Share Plan Following approval at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 11 April 2007, the Company established a new Performance Share Plan PSP.
This plan was designed to align the interests of shareholders and directors by means of performance targets.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the scheme and the grant of awards subject to performance conditions under its terms.
The performance criterion that must be met requires the Companys earnings per share exceed certain targets set by the Remuneration Committee over a three year period.
Thereafter the option may be exercised for the remaining part of its five year life without further test.
The Performance Share Plan rules permit a maximum of 200% of salary to be available for an award in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
Save As You Earn Share Scheme SAYE The Company also operates an SAYE scheme where options may be granted at up to a 20% discount to market value at date of grant.
The executive directors are not eligible to participate in this scheme.
Pension arrangements A sum is paid to money purchase defined contribution arrangements for the executive directors and life cover is also provided.
