Persimmon Plc 42 Remuneration Report The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2007.
A resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2008.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for setting each executive Directors remuneration.
The Committees current terms of reference were adopted on 25 February 2004 and are available on the Companys website or from the Group Company Secretary.
The Committee is comprised of three non-executive Directors, Nicholas Wrigley Chairman, David Thompson and Neil Davidson, all of whom the Board considers to be independent.
Nicholas Wrigley was appointed to the Committee on 18 December 2007 following Adam Applegarths resignation from the Committee on 29 October 2007.
Remuneration policy A complete review of the executive Directors remuneration was carried out at the end of 2006 and the current policy, which was effective from 1 January 2007, was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in April 2007.
In preparing the remuneration policy, the Committee sought independent advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC, who are leading advisors on executive remuneration.
NBSC were appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other service to the Company.
In addition, the Committee consulted with the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, although neither participated in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The objective of the policy is to have a remuneration package which will retain the talented executive team and be performance orientated.
The executive Directors remuneration policy has a higher than typical emphasis on variable pay, which has helped to motivate the Directors to drive the excellent performance of the Company in the past.
The Committee considers that the policy ensures that the executive Directors remuneration is in line with market standards and best practice, closely aligning the Directors interests with those of shareholders in creating shareholder value.
The remuneration of the executive Directors consists of different elements of pay and benefits, which make up the whole remuneration package.
The components include basic salary, annual bonus, long term incentive awards and pensions.
Basic salaries were set on 1 January 2007 at broadly market median level, by reference to other FTSE 100 companies of a similar size.
Annual bonus is performance related and the performance conditions are set on profit before tax and earnings per share targets.
The targets are set to allow a potentially high proportion of performance related pay for exceptional performance.
The Committee considers it is importantthatthe executive Directors are appropriately rewarded for continuing to deliver exceptional value to shareholders and to retain their expertise.
Each Directors annual bonus is capped and if minimum targets are not reached, no annual bonus is payable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards are designed to align this longer term element of remuneration with the Companys financial performance and with the interests of shareholders.
The performance conditions attached to the vesting of LTIP Awards are based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return versus a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 100 and the Companys Return on Capital Employed.
The Committee still considers that it is important to remunerate John White and Mike Farley at similar levels.
Although Mike Farley has full CEO responsibility, the Committee is satisfied that these two very highly rated executives should be paid at market competitive rates for a company chief executive.
John White brings a wealth of experience of the sector and knowledge of the Company which the Board considers essential for the Company to retain.
This approach is recognised as being transitional, until such time as John White begins to step back from full time executive duties, when his remuneration would reduce commensurately.
Full details of both the quantum of the individual components of the packages and the structure of annual bonus, long term incentive awards and pension provision, are summarised below.
Basic salary Executive Directors basic salaries for 2007 were set at a broadly market median level, by reference to other FTSE 100 companies of a similar size.
Basic salaries will increase by 3% in 2008 and are set out below: 2008 2007 John White 633,450 615,000 Mike Farley 633,450 615,000 Mike Killoran 412,000 400,000 David Bryant 272,950 265,000 Annual bonus Annual bonuses are performance related and non-pensionable.
There are two performance targets for annual bonuses, Group profit before tax PBT and earnings per share EPS.
The Committee considers that these targets will incentivise the Directors in line with the Companys strategic aims set out on pages 8 and 9.
The Committee has determined an appropriate sliding scale around a target figure for both EPS and PBT.
Recognising the uncertain outlook for performance in 2008, compared to 2007, the Committee has increased the degree of stretch in the sliding scale around budget, for both the EPS and PBT parts.
In addition, the proportion of the maximum bonus payable at target performance has been reduced from two-thirds to 50% and the amount payable at threshold reduced from 25% to 20%.
The maximum bonus limits remain unchanged.
Persimmon Plc Remuneration Report 43 The Committee has determined that the total level of potential annual bonus payable to the executive Directors will be capped at a predetermined figure expressed as a percentage of basic salary, which varies by Director as follows: Maximum annual bonus potential for 2008 as a percentage of salary 2008 2007 John White 250% 250% Mike Farley 250% 250% Mike Killoran 250% 250% David Bryant 175% 175% The balance of any bonus earned in excess of 150% of basic salary is awarded in the Companys shares Bonus Shares, which may vest in two equal tranches over a two year period.
Bonus Shares are awarded at the same time as the cash bonus, with the first tranche vesting after the announcement of the Groups preliminary results in the following year and the second tranche vesting after the announcement of the Groups preliminary results the year after.
Each Director has the option to elect that the shares vest in a six month period from the date of the relevant announcement.
Any unvested Bonus Shares would be forfeited on termination of employment if the executive Director resigns or is dismissed summarily.
The number of Bonus Shares awarded for 2007 is calculated by dividing the balance of any bonus earned in excess of 150% of basic salary by the average shareprice in the period 1 January 2008 to 14 February 2008.
Long Term Incentive Plan The executive Directors are granted awards under the Companys LTIP, up to a maximum value of 250% of basic salary.
During 2007 John White and Mike Farley received an award of 200% of basic salary and Mike Killoran and David Bryant received an award equivalent to 150% of basic salary.
In 2008 the Committee will make the same level of awards to the executive Directors.
LTIP awards vest after a three year performance period.
The performance conditions are based on Total Shareholder Return TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE, with 50% of an award linked to TSR and 50% linked to ROCE.
The Committee considers this provides a good blend between rewarding long term financial performance and superior stock market performance.
The performance conditions for 2008 awards are unchanged from those that attached to the awards made in 2007.
The award based on TSR performance will measure the Companys TSR against the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index excluding Investment Trusts as at the date of grant.
The FTSE 100 is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark against which to compare Persimmons TSR, as there are an insufficient number of large housebuilders to provide a robust comparator group and the sector may consolidate further.
The vesting schedule for TSR is 25% of this part of the award for median performance, with sliding scale increases until full vesting at the upper quartile.
In respect of the part of the award based on ROCE targets, 25% of the shares linked to this condition will vest if ROCE over the performance period is 15%, with a sliding scale up to all of the shares if ROCE is 22% or above.
This range, in the view of the Committee, currently reflects the outlook for the house building sector.
For grants in future years, the Committee will review the ROCE range in the light of the outlook for the house building sector at that time.
Pension The executive Directors are members of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
The normal retirement age for executive Directors is 60.
The Committee has agreed that an executive Director who elected to cease accruing further service in the Groups defined benefit scheme from 6 April 2006 will instead receive a salary supplement of 30% of basic salary.
The Committee considers that the salary supplement is cost neutral to the Company.
John White, Mike Farley and David Bryant have elected not to accrue any further service in the scheme.
However their pension will continue to be based on their pensionable salary at the date of leaving the Group and they remain members of the scheme for life insurance purposes.
A salary cap for pension purposes was introduced last year to mitigate the impact of the executive Directors salary increases effective from 1 January 2007.
John White, Mike Farley and David Bryants pensionable salary caps are 473,000, 420,000 and 258,500 respectively, well below their basic salaries.
Mike Killoran elected to continue service in the Scheme and accrues benefit at 1 45th of his basic salary for service after 6 April 2006.
Mike Killorans service in the Scheme prior to this date was subject to the HMRC Earnings Cap and his current Scheme cap for service up to 5 April 2006 is 116,160.
The pensionable salary caps for the executive Directors will increase annually in accordance with their increase in basic salary, up to a maximum of 5% p. a. Persimmon Plc Remuneration Report 44 Benefits in kind Each of the executive Directors remuneration also includes fully financed cars or cash car allowance, membership of the Group private medical scheme and the Group income protection scheme, subscriptions and some telephone costs.
These benefits are not pensionable.
All employee share scheme The executive Directors may also participate in the Companys Save asYou Earn Scheme, which is open to all permanent employees who have more than six months service.
Service contracts All executive Directors have service contracts and in line with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, the notice period for each executive Director does not exceed 12 months.
The contracts expire on the Directors 60th birthday.
In circumstances following a change of control, or where dismissed in breach of contract, an executive Director is entitled to payments for termination of employment, but in no circumstances will such payments exceed 12 months remuneration.
The executive Directors contracts are all dated 24 April 2002 but are effective from 1 January 2002.
None of the non-executive Directors has service contracts.
Mike Killoran and Hamish Leslie Melville will retire at the 2008 Annual General Meeting and are offering themselves for re-election.
Share ownership guidelines The Committee has for some time encouraged significant long term share ownership of the Companys shares by the executive Directors.
In order to comply with best practice, formal share ownership guidelines were established in 2002.
As a result, the Committee now requires each executive Director to hold Persimmon shares.
John White and Mike Farley have to hold a minimum value of shares equivalent to three times their basic salary and the other executive Directors are required to maintain shareholdings equivalent in value to two times their basic salary.
In all cases the executive Directors shareholdings are significantly in excess of the shareholding guidelines.
The Committee recognises that executive Directors may be required to sell sufficient shares in the Company to satisfy any tax liability arising on the vesting of Bonus Shares or the exercise of options and vesting of awards granted under the Companys LTIP and Synergy Incentive Plans from time to time.
External appointments None of the executive Directors currently has an external appointment.
Should an executive wish to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Group Chairman and or the Group Chief Executive.
Performance graph Shown below is the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 100 Index over the last five financial years.
The Board has chosen this comparator as it is the benchmark for measuring the stock market performance of large UK listed companies.

The fees for 2008 are 48,000 p. a. plus an additional fee of 8,500 p. a. for additional responsibilities in chairing a committee.
Persimmon Plc Remuneration Report 45 The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
As a result the salary paid to Mike Killoran as a member accruing service in this scheme was reduced by 9% of his pensionable salary, which would have been the rate of contribution to the scheme.
Salary related benefits remain based on his salary published on page 42.
The performance-related bonus for 2007 cash and deferred shares has been earned as a result of the performance by reference to Group PBT and EPS.
Notwithstanding this excellent performance, maximum bonus levels have not been payable.
As set out in the policy section, annual bonus earned for 2007 in excess of 150% of basic salary is deferred in shares for up to two years.
