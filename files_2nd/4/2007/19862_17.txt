The first part of the report provides details of UK COALs Remuneration Policy.
The second part provides details of the remuneration, service contracts and share interests of all the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The Remuneration Report is unaudited except for those parts marked with an asterix.
The Directors confirm that this report has been drawn up in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Combined Code 2006 on Corporate Governance Combined Code.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Responsibility for reviewing Group remuneration strategy and policy, recommending any changes and approving individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee rests with the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
The Committee consists exclusively of non-executive Directors and meets on at least two occasions each year.
The members in 2007 were: Mike Toms Committee Chairman, Peter Hazell, David Jones and Kevin Whiteman member from 1 June 2007.
The Committee may seek any information it requires from any employee or Director, and all employees and Directors are required to cooperate with any request made by the Committee.
Richard Cole Company Secretary and Norman Haslam Human Resources and Communications Director provided information to the Committee during the year.
The Remuneration Committee also meets without management and receives information and independent executive remuneration advice from remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC.
NBSC does not provide any other services to the Group.
Neither the Chairman nor the executive Directors participate in discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has terms of reference, approved by the Board, which are available from the Company Secretary and via the Companys website.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The policy of the Committee recognises that the Company requires high quality and committed executive Directors and other senior executives in order to deliver appropriate levels of performance.
The Committee therefore conducts its work to determine the appropriate remuneration levels and structure consistent with the need to attract, motivate and retain executive Directors of the high quality required to further the Companys interests.
The executive Directors remuneration comprises a base salary, an annual performance bonus, participation in a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, a car or car allowance, pension contributions to a defined contribution pension scheme or pension allowance and health insurance.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
The Company is required to seek shareholder approval for this report, and to put forward any new incentive schemes for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
There are no changes proposed to the remuneration policy for 2008.
In order to allow the Company to pay the Chairman and non-executive Directors competitive fee levels with respect to FTSE 250 non-executives, and to provide sufficient headroom to review these fees annually, a resolution is being proposed to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to increase the aggregate limit of fees that may be paid in accordance with the Articles of Association from 300,000 to 500,000.
The following paragraphs explain the operation of the main constituents of the remuneration policy.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 55 CHAIRMAN The Chairman receives fees commensurate with his duties, which include: managing the business of the Board and its Committees, maximising long-term shareholder value by reviewing short-term performance, risk management and long-term development of the Group, ensuring that corporate governance is in line with best practice, ensuring a management succession process is in place and working, making recommendations on the remuneration of all other non-executive Directors and agreeing with the Chief Executive the most appropriate role of the Chairman vis--vis stakeholders including Government, shareholders, the financial community, customers, competitors, potential and actual partners, trade unions, employees, the media and the wider community.
Following a review of the time commitment, duties associated with this role and current market fee levels, the Chairmans fee has been reviewed by the Committee and, subject to approval of the resolution to increase the aggregate level of Directors fees, will increase to 150,000 per annum after the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Base Salaries Executive Directors salaries are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
In determining salary levels for executives, due regard is given to external market data in similarly sized companies across a range of sectors, personal and Group performance and pay and employment conditions within the Group.
Following a review of executive Directors salary levels, Messrs Lloyds and Brocksoms base salaries have been increased from 330,000 to 375,000 and from 225,000 to 234,675 respectively, with effect from 1 January 2008.
Annual Bonus The annual bonus provides an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 80% Chief Executive and 0% to 75% for other executive Directors of base salary.
At the start of the incentive year 1 January, the Remuneration Committee sets both the performance measures and targets based on the Groups business priorities.
These targets ensure that incentives at the higher end of the range are payable only for demonstrably superior Group and individual performance.
In respect of 2007, Jon Lloyd received a bonus of 168,327, David Brocksom received a bonus of 33,936, Garold Spindler received a bonus of 133,315 and Christopher Mawe received a bonus of 127,875.
The bonus for the period represented 63% of basic pay for Jon Lloyd, 52% of basic pay for David Brocksom, 43% of basic pay for Garold Spindler, and 52% of basic pay for Christopher Mawe.
The targets for 2007 were cash flow, profit, growth in property net asset value and personal performance.
In 2008 the following measures will be applied for each Director in the proportions shown: Growth in Property Net Asset Cash Flow Profit Value Safety Personal % % % % % Jon Lloyd 20 20 20 20 20 David Brocksom 25 25 10 20 20 55 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 56 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Long Term Incentive Plan Under the terms of the current LTIP, an award of shares up to a maximum value of 100% of base salary is conditionally allocated to each executive Director.
These shares are released to the executive three years from the date of grant of award, contingent upon continued service subject to exceptions as set out in the plan and the Group achieving predetermined levels of performance, with performance being measured as the percentage growth in the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three year period.
For all awards granted in 2005 and 2006, in order for any part of an award to vest, the Group must have achieved earnings per share growth at least equal to the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum.
If this test is not met then the award will lapse.
If the test is met then the proportion of the award vesting will be determined in accordance with the Companys TSR performance over the period, as set out below.
Growth in TSR % of Award vesting Below 75% Nil 75% or above 30 100% or above 50 150% or above 100 For TSR increases within these bands, shares are allocated on a straight-line basis.
The performance condition attached to awards granted in 2007 requires absolute TSR growth of between 25% and 75% for between 30% and 100% of an award to vest, with straight-line vesting in between.
The Committee will review this performance condition on a regular basis to ensure that it is sufficiently demanding.
The earnings per share growth underpin, where the Company must achieve earnings per share growth of at least equal to the increase in RPI plus 3% per annum in order for any part of an award to vest, continues to operate for awards granted in 2007.
In the event of a change of control, vesting of shares under the LTIP is not automatic and would depend upon the extent to which the performance conditions had been satisfied within the period six months prior to that date.

Other Terms and Conditions of Service The executive Directors service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Remuneration Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required to manage the Group.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a notice period of no more than one year is appropriate.
It is the Companys policy not to enter into service contracts that provide written notice of more than one year.
In respect of Jon Lloyd, employment will continue until terminated by the Company giving the executive not less than twelve months written notice, or by the executive giving the Company not less than six months written notice.
David Brocksoms contract shall continue until either party terminates it by not less than twelve months notice in writing.
Executive Directors service contracts do not contain provisions for compensation in the event of early termination.
When calculating termination payments, the Remuneration Committee takes into account a variety of factors including individual and Group performance, the obligation of the Director to mitigate his own loss for example by gaining new employment, his length of service and the best interests of the Group.
Although there is no specific provision for liquidated damages should the Company terminate the contract of a Director, compensation for loss of office is limited to the amounts payable under these notice periods.
There are no special provisions for payments to Directors on a change of control.
Any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made less any deductions the employer is required to make and shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights or statutory employment protection claims.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Board aims to recruit non-executive Directors of a high calibre with broad commercial and other relevant experience.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year period.
The terms of their engagement are set out in a letter of appointment.
The initial appointment and any subsequent re-appointment is subject to election or re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The letters of appointment contain threemonth notice periods.
Compensation for loss of office is limited to the amounts payable under these notice periods.
The Board considers these notice periods appropriate given the skills and expertise of the Directors.
Non-executive Directors are paid a basic fee.
Additional fees are payable for chairing a committee.
Following a review of time commitments, responsibility levels and current market fee levels it is proposed that subject to approval of the resolution to increase the aggregate level of Directors fees, the base fee for non-executive Directors will increase from 34,000 to 40,000 per annum after the 2008 Annual General meeting.
The additional fee for chairing a committee will also increase from 5,000 to 6,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
