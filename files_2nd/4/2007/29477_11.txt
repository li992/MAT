The Report will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
It also contains additional information required by the FSA Listing Rules and the Combined Code on corporate governance.
The sections marked with an asterisk are subject to audit by KPMG Audit Plc.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company, including the Chairman.
The Committee also monitors the remuneration of the senior management team and oversees the operation of the executive long term incentive schemes.
Members of the Committee during the year were Michael Sorkin as Chairman, Derek Netherton and Simon Gulliford, all of whom are independent non-executive Directors.
Simon Gulliford resigned as a non-executive Director of the Company in February 2008 and has been replaced on the Committee by Roger Walsom.
The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed at least annually and the terms of reference are available on request and on the Companys website.
Details of the number of meetings of the Committee during the year can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 38.
The Company Secretary, Hugh Gladman, acts as Secretary to the Committee, providing advice on corporate governance, legal and regulatory issues and the design and operation of the long term incentive schemes.
At the Committees request, Committee meetings are also attended by other executives, in particular the Chairman and Chief Executive, who may make recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the remuneration packages of individual Directors or policy generally.
Such recommendations are discussed by the Committee and adopted or amended as the Committee sees fit.
No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when his own remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
The Committee also has access, as required, to professional advice and market data and this was provided by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC in 2007.
NBSC was appointed by the Committee to provide advice and data on executive remuneration, long term incentives and other remuneration issues and they have not provided any other services to the Company.
Remuneration Policy The Committee applies the principles set out in the Combined Code when setting remuneration policy.
The remuneration policy, as approved by the Committee, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of sufficient calibre to enable the Group to achieve its business objectives.
The Committee aims to set fixed benefits salary, pension and fringe benefits at below the median position for companies of a similar size in the UK financial services market although a cross check is also made against companies 48 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2007 211729 SJP R&A 2007 txt:JR0530 Report & Accounts 2007 16 3 08 11:12 Page 49 Remuneration Report continued of a similar size in other sectors, with significant annual bonus and long term incentive awards enhancing an executives potential total remuneration to on or above the median, but only if stretching short term and long term performance targets are achieved.
In this way, the Committee aims to incentivise the Directors to achieve above average results compared with competitor organisations.
The incentive schemes are designed to be retentive in nature as well as linking the value of an award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
Based on data provided by NBSC, approximately 50-55% of the total remuneration of the executive Directors is performance related, except for Mike Wilson, the Chairman, where approximately 40% of his total remuneration is performance related.
The full-time executive Chairman, Mike Wilson, does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
He does however, participate in the long term incentive scheme the Performance Share Plan, as this plan focuses on long term value creation rather than the more operationally focussed annual bonus plan.
Any shares in the Company which vest to Mike Wilson will be retained by him until he ceases to be a Director of the Company, less any shares required to meet a tax liability on vesting.
The Committee also operates shareholding guidelines for the executive Directors, whereby as and when awards vest under the Performance Share Plan or other long term incentive schemes, the executive Directors are required to retain no fewer than 50% of the vested shares, less any shares required to pay any tax liability which arises on vesting, until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of base salary has been achieved.
The Committee has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code in designing schemes of performance-related remuneration.
Further details of all of the above elements of remuneration are set out below.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using comparative company data provided by NBSC.
As stated above, the Committee aims to set fixed benefits salary, pension and fringe benefits below the median position for companies of a similar size in the UK financial services market with a cross check with other sectors, with adjustments then being made to take into account the responsibility and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and any other relevant factors.
On this basis, the Committee approved the following salary increases for the executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2008: New Salary Previous Salary David Bellamy 425,000 400,000 Ian Gascoigne 320,000 300,000 Andrew Croft 320,000 300,000 David Lamb 250,000 200,000 Mike Wilson 525,000 500,000 In respect of David Bellamy, Ian Gascoigne and Andrew Croft, the above new salaries, when taken together with pension and other fringe benefits, are below the median, based on the comparator data provided by NSBC and the increases are considered appropriate after taking account of performance and increased experience of the individual.
For David Lamb, his new salary has been consciously positioned below the median in light of his recent appointment to the Board, although the Committee expects his salary to increase over time to a market level as he becomes more experienced in the role.
With respect to the Chairman, an increase was considered appropriate by the Committee after reviewing market data for comparable roles and recognising that his salary had not been changed for three years.
49 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2007 211729 SJP R&A 2007 txt:JR0530 Report & Accounts 2007 16 3 08 11:12 Page 50 Remuneration Report continued Annual Bonus For 2008, as in previous years, the Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus will be 120% of salary, with half of any bonus award payable in cash, the remainder being invested in the Companys shares and deferred for three years.
Taking the cash and shares element of the bonus together, up to 80% of salary will be awarded by reference to the performance of the Group, largely based on growth in European Embedded Value operating profit before tax, although the Committee retains the discretion to amend the bonus, up or down, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared with competitor organisations, regulatory issues, overall client satisfaction and completion of other business plan objectives.
Up to a further 40% of salary will be awarded by reference to the personal performance of the executive Director.
The operating profit target set by the Committee is based on a sliding scale, to progressively reward incremental performance.
The range of operating profit before tax for the 2008 bonus represents a significant increase from the actual level of operating profit before tax achieved in 2007, after excluding the benefit of the positive experience variance on 2007.
The Committee is also able to take into account the performance of the Group on environmental, social and governance ESG matters when assessing the bonus to be paid to the executive Directors.
The Committee believes that the Groups remuneration structure helps to alleviate ESG risks affecting the Group.
No executive Director has a contractual right to receive an annual bonus award.
The satisfaction of the targets is assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems verified by the Committee, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of the performance targets.
Mike Wilson does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
The Committee believes that the annual bonus scheme is an effective incentive for the executive Directors, whilst at the same time offering strong retentive characteristics through the deferred element which normally lapses if an executive leaves the Group, as well as being aligned with shareholder interests due to the value of the deferred element of the award on vesting being dependent on share price performance.
Long Term Incentive Schemes All UK employees of the Group, including the executive Directors, are eligible to enter into a Save As You Earn SAYE contract, under which they are able to save up to 250 per month, and at the end of a three year savings period acquire shares in the Company at a price not less than 80 per cent of the market price of SJP shares at the date of the invitation to participate.
The sole long term incentive plan operated by the Company is the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Under this Plan, the Committee may make awards of performance shares to the executive Directors, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of challenging performance conditions.
The PSP is also used to make awards to other senior managers within the Group.
50 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2007 211729 SJP R&A 2007 txt:JR0530 Report & Accounts 2007 16 3 08 11:13 Page 51 Remuneration Report continued The Committee reviewed the grant levels and the performance conditions in January 2008 and, after the higher grant level of 175% of salary in 2007, decided to revert to the ongoing policy of making annual PSP awards to the executive Directors with a value representing 150% of base salary, subject to the same mix of EPS and TSR performance conditions as in 2007.
For 2008 awards under the PSP, two-thirds of the shares are subject to an earnings growth condition and one-third of the shares are subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR condition, both measured over a single three-year period.
Awards vest after three years subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and continued employment.
The Committee believes that this provides an appropriate balance of targets that both incentivise the executives to achieve stretching long term financial performance targets, whilst also keeping their interests aligned with those of shareholders.
Earnings per share is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the European Embedded Value EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out the EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change.
Shareholders will appreciate that these factors are not within the control of management and produce wide variations in reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
For the awards made in 2008, the two-thirds of the shares based on earnings will vest if the following growth targets are achieved: Average annual earnings growth Proportion exercisable Below RPI 7% Zero RPI 7% 25% RPI 16% or more 100% Between the above points Pro rata between 25% and 100% The Committee assessed these thresholds and believe them to be suitably demanding in the context of the prospects of the Company and the current operating environment.
The Committee decided to reduce the earnings growth scale from RPI 8 to 18% in 2007 to RPI 7 to 16% for 2008 after taking account of the challenging trading environment caused by recent market instability and concerns over the availability of credit.
In addition, the 2007 year end earnings figure represented outstanding performance and results in a higher base from which to grow earnings in the future.
The Committee believes the new earnings growth scale to be no less demanding for the executives, in the circumstances, as the scales applicable in previous years.
For the one third of shares based on TSR, these will vest as for awards made in 2007 as follows: Companys ranking compared to comparator group # Proportion exercisable at end of performance period Below median Zero Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between the above points Pro rata Details of the awards made under the PSP are set out on page 56.
# The comparator group comprises: Aberdeen Asset Management, Aviva, Bradford & Bingley, Close Brothers, F&C Asset Management, Friends Provident, Henderson Group, Investec, Legal & General, New Star Asset Management, Old Mutual, Prudential, Hargreaves Lansdown, Rathbone Brothers, Schroders and Standard Life.
These companies were selected by the Committee as a result of having business interests reasonably comparable with those of the St. Jamess Place Group.

The costs of the pension and death in service arrangements for the executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2007 are shown on page 55.
Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benefits in lieu of any outstanding period of notice on a monthly basis so that, should the executive obtain alternative employment during the notice period, the monthly payments can be reduced to take into account any earnings received under the new employment.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
All of the executive Directors have entered into a service agreement with the Company.
Each service agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreements automatically terminate on the 65th birthday of the executive, except for Mike Wilson, whose agreement terminates on 31 December 2011, as explained in the Chief Executives Statement on page 7.
All the service agreements provide for benefits in kind, including life assurance, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
Mike Wilson and David Bellamy are also entitled to a chauffeur.
Further details of the service agreements of the executive Directors are provided below: Executive Date of contract Base salary Date contract automatically terminates Mike Wilson 27 May 2005 525,000 31 December 2011 David Bellamy 8 August 2006 425,000 15 April 2018 Ian Gascoigne 8 August 2006 320,000 7 July 2021 David Lamb 8 August 2006 250,000 31 January 2022 Andrew Croft 8 August 2006 320,000 11 June 2029 Currently, no executive Director acts as a non-executive Director on the Board of another listed company.

No other Directors had any such contributions made on their behalf.
Mike Wilsons contributions amounting to 100,000 were paid as additional salary due to the pensions cap.
iv For the annual discretionary bonus in 2007, executive Directors could earn up to 80% of salary by reference to Group performance based on growth in pre-tax operating profit and other business plan targets set at the start of the year, including growth in the net manpower of the Partnership, growth in the productivity of the Partnership and the successful launch of various initiatives such as new funds and other services to further develop the Groups unique approach to investment management.
A further payment of up to 40% of salary could be earned by reference to individual performance both individually and as a team, based on personal objectives set at the start of the year and the executives performance generally in 2007.
The Remuneration Committee met in January 2008 to review the performance of the Group and the executives against the objectives set at the start of the year.
