The maximum amount that an individual could receive under the profit element was 100% of salary.
In addition, cash flow targets were set for the Group as a whole and, where appropriate, divisional cash flow performance for each half of the year.
Cash flow targets were substantially achieved, resulting in payments of between 4% and 10% of salary.
In relation to profit performance, achievements resulted in payments of between 45% and 86% of salary.
In relation to divisional strategy performance, achievements resulted in payments of between 10% and 20% of salary.
Actual total payments to executive Directors under the 2007 short term variable remuneration scheme varied between 69% and 96% of salary.
