DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2007 D fide EA AR R S SH HA AR RE EH HO OL LD fide ER R FRANK DEE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITEE Chairman of the Remuneration N N Broadhurst I am pleased to introduce this report after succeeding David Committee D A Haxby Haxby as chairman of the Remuneration Committee in December F Dee 2007.
I would like to thank David Haxby for his leadership in A J McWalter M A Young chairing the Committee for the last six years.
The Remuneration Committee continues to review the Companys remuneration policy as it applies to executive directors and other senior executives to ensure that it remains appropriate for both the Company and shareholders.
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors and other senior executives of the high calibre necessary to maintain the Groups strong financial performance which should enhance value to shareholders.
The key principles of this policy are: To pay around median salaries, while taking account of individual performance and responsibilities: To ensure that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors and other senior executives is performance-related: and To encourage share ownership.
The executive directors have share ownership guidelines, participate in share-based long-term incentive plans and can be required to defer a portion of their annual bonus into shares.
In addition, every employee in the Group with at least 12 months service has the opportunity to become a shareholder in the Company through the Sharesave Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan.
Significant issues addressed during the year were: The remuneration package awarded to David Postings on his joining the Company to succeed Sen Mahon as Chief Executive: and The making of exceptional LTIP Performance Awards to the three continuing executive directors and of awards under the Management Share Plan to nine senior non-main Board executives after the announcement of David Postings appointment and following specific overtures being made to certain Cattles senior executives by a competitor organisation.
The Remuneration Committee is entirely comfortable that the approaches adopted were very much in the interests of shareholders as they ensure that the entire highly regarded Cattles executive team continues to remain fully committed to the generation of sustained long-term returns to shareholders.
I am keen to encourage an ongoing dialogue with shareholders.
Accordingly, please feel free to contact me, either by writing to me at the Companys head office or by email to frankdee@cattles.

62 Annual Report and Cattles plc Financial Statements 2007 OVERVIEW 0011 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 1240 GOVERNANCE 4168 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 69118 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 119120 The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G Collins is the amount that would be paid each year to the director in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of him having left service at the end of the year.
The accrued pension entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements earned as an employee, prior to becoming a director, as well as those earned for qualifying services after becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued pension entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year-end and that at the previous year-end.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the additional accrued benefits and of the accrued pension entitlement in respect of qualifying services represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits that he has earned in respect of qualifying services.
They do not represent sums payable to the director and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the additional accrued benefits earned in the year less directors contribution is the transfer value of the additional accrued benefits in respect of qualifying services earned in the year after deducting the directors personal contribution to the scheme during the year.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contribution is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits in respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
