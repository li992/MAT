ENTITLEMENTS i The DMGT Senior Executives Pension Fund, of which five executive Directors are members, has since 1st April, 2005 required a contribution from its members.
The normal retirement age under the Fund for this group is 60.
For each Director, the accrued entitlement at 30th September, 2007 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each Director at this date.
A spouses dependants pension equal to two-thirds of the Directors pension is incorporated and the Director can currently elect to receive the pension from age 50, subject to a discount if retirement takes place before 60.
The pension, when in payment, will receive annual increases in line with inflation, which may be limited when inflation exceeds 3% per annum.
ii All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
