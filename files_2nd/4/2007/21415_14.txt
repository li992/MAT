Directors remuneration report Consideration of matters relating to directors remuneration The remuneration policy is set by the board and is described below.
Individual remuneration packages of executive directors and the chairman are determined by the remuneration committee within the framework of this policy.
The remuneration committee consists of the non-executive directors and during the year the members included Dudley Fishburn as chairman, Andy Pomfret, Dan Jones and Gordon Hamilton.
The company views each of these directors as independent.
The committee met five times during the year.
The committee receives advice from a variety of sources on issues where it considers it appropriate.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP advised the committee on ongoing issues.
The committee also calls on specialist advice from a variety of additional sources including SBJ benefit Consultants Limited for pensions advice, Watson Wyatt publications for salary data, Equiniti, and internal advisers including the chief executive and the company secretary who present to the committee on specic issues.
Remuneration policy statement The directors believe that performance related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff, and this policy will form the basis for determining executive directors remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The companys policy is to remunerate the executive directors and other management fairly in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualied personnel.
The measurement of the executive directors performance and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the remuneration committee.
The main elements of the remuneration package payable under the service agreement of each executive director comprise basic salary, short-term incentive payments, pension contributions, share-based incentives and other benets.
Other benets include private medical insurance for the director and his immediate family, permanent health insurance, death in service benefit at four times annual salary, accident and travel insurance, healthclub membership, season ticket, car parking and the provision of either a company car or a monthly car allowance.
In line with Lloyds market practice there are no upper limits on the amounts payable to individuals under short-term incentives.
The committee has considered whether it is appropriate to set an upper limit and has agreed that such a limit would adversely affect the companys competitive position and would not be in the interests of shareholders.
The incentive payments, which comprise short-term incentive payments and share incentive plans, are awarded on a discretionary basis, and are determined by the committee in respect of performance of both the individual and the company.
As the profitability of the group has improved signicantly during the year, the committee was able to reect this improved performance in the incentive awards made to directors.
The policy is to ensure that a material proportion of each executive directors overall remuneration is performance based to align executive directors interests with those of shareholders.
The board, on a bi-annual basis, determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors with details set out below.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The directors believe that a key element of the remuneration strategy is the share incentive plans that further align the interests of participants in the plans with shareholders interests.
Entitlements under certain plans are subject to the achievement of performance conditions as described below under share incentive plans.
Also it is important that the incentive arrangements for directors include an element of downside risk by having shareholdings and through the deferral of future bonuses that will be at risk if the syndicate declares losses.
Section headings marked indicate the information in that section has been audited.
com Service contracts The company has service contracts with executive directors.
It is company policy that such contracts contain notice periods of not more than twelve months.
Details of the contracts currently in place for executive directors who have served during the year and their basic salary for 2008 are as follows: Annual salary Provision for Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period compensation A F Beazley 450,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil N H Furlonge 225,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil J G Gray 285,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil D A Horton 280,000 1 Jun 2003 n a 12 months Nil N P Maidment 260,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil J G Rowell 400,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil C A Washbourn 260,000 6 Dec 2006 n a 12 months Nil The unexpired term is not applicable as each of the executive directors contract is on a rolling basis.
Subject to the notice requirements described above, there is no provision in the service agreements for compensation to be payable on early termination of the contract.
The company will normally phase any payments of compensation which will also be subject to negotiation and mitigation.
Non-executive directors The fees of non-executive directors, other than the chairman, are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services.
No non-executive director participates in the companys incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for xed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Nonexecutive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that includes the candidate bringing the desired competence and skills to the group.
The board has identied several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies are as follows: Insurance sector expertise: Asset management skills: Public company and corporate governance experience: Risk management skills: and Finance skills.
A bi-annual review of the fees and other income payable was carried by the board in December 2006.
Details of the non-executive directors terms of appointment and their fees for 2008 are set out below: Current Other annual fees Term of income appointment Expires J G W Agnew 75,000 3 years 31 Dec 2008 J D Fishburn 42,000 3 years 31 Dec 2008 7,000 A D Pomfret 42,000 3 years 31 Dec 2008 14,000 D L Jones 42,000 3 years 30 June 2009 W M Becker 42,000 3 years 7 May 2009 A G K Hamilton 42,000 3 years 7 Sept 2009 Other income relates to the additional fee payable to A D Pomfret in respect of his chairmanship of the audit committee and as senior non-executive director and to J D Fishburn in respect of his chairmanship of the remuneration committee.

2 The benets comprise those detailed in the service contracts of the executive directors and relate to the standard benets such as private medical insurance, car allowance, etc.
3 The directors have deferred bonus entitlements to support their underwriting through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited.
com Salary The remuneration committee reviews salaries annually taking into account levels in comparable positions in other similar financial companies.
It also considers the performance of the group, individual and average salary increases for employees across the whole group.
The annual salary reviews take place in December of each year and the remuneration committee agreed that there should be no salary increases awarded for 2008 for the executive directors as a measure to increase awareness for cost management in the business.
Short-term incentives Enterprise bonus pool A scheme based on achieving stretching target returns on group equity with minimum hurdles to be met has been established that better aligns the interests of directors and staff with shareholders.
A proportion of this pool is allocated among executive directors at the discretion of the committee.
In determining the award levels, as the groups return on equity has improved, the level of awards made was increased.
In addition, a proportion of any award can be paid in deferred shares that will vest after three years dependent only on continued employment.
It has been agreed that dividends on shares paid prior to vesting will be rolled up and paid as an equivalent cash bonus at the time of the vesting of the shares.
Retention plan In addition to the enterprise bonus pool, senior executives will be eligible to receive conditional awards of ordinary shares under the retention plan.
The retention plan is operated on a discretionary basis based on performance to ensure key individuals have an adequate retention package and the first grant of awards was made in April 2005.
The remuneration committee has concluded that the award of retention shares should be targeted at key staff where retention is essential to the business.
During the year the remuneration committee reviewed rules of the scheme and concluded that the release of the shares that had been awarded should be accelerated from releasing 15% of the outstanding awards every year after the first three years so that the retention value was better recognised by the employees.
The rules were amended as follows: For awards made prior to November 2006, 33% of the shares will be released on the third anniversary and for the two years after that, a further 33% of the original award of shares will vest: and For awards made in or after November 2006, 25% of the shares will be released on the third anniversary and for the three years after that, a further 25% of the original award of shares will vest.
The total number of shares awarded to date has been 7,583,704 of which 5,941,820 ordinary shares are held by the employee benefit trust.
Special award of retention shares to Andrew Horton On 5 October 2007 the remuneration committee awarded 1 million retention shares to Andrew Horton which was in excess of the grants allowed under the existing scheme.
The committee felt it was necessary to provide this meaningful incentive to retain his services in the longer term as he has made a significant contribution to the group.
25% of the shares awarded shall become transferable to Andrew Horton on the third anniversary of the grant.
Thereafter, 25% of the original award under the scheme shall become transferable on the anniversary for each subsequent three financial years, subject to Andrew remaining a director or employee within the companys group.
Dividends on shares still subject to retention will be rolled up and paid from the third anniversary and thereafter whenever dividends are paid to shareholders.
The award will be forfeited if Andrew Horton ceases to be an employee or director of the companys group unless he ceases by reason of injury, ill-health or permanent disability, retirement, redundancy, the sale or transfer of his employing company or business out of the companys group, or any other reason permitted by the remuneration committee.
In these circumstances, the award will vest early to the extent and on such terms determined by the remuneration committee.
In the event of a takeover not being an internal corporate reorganisation or the voluntary winding-up of the company the award will vest early.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards may be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company.
No payment is required on the grant of the award.
The award is not transferable, except on death.
The award is not pensionable.
The award is over shares held by the companys employees benefit trust and does not confer any shareholder rights until shares are transferred.
In the event of any variation of the companys share capital the remuneration committee may make such adjustment as it considers fair and reasonable to the number of shares subject to the award.
The remuneration committee may, at any time, amend this special award in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of Andrew Horton in respect of the terms applying to the size of his award and the basis for determining his entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares and the adjustment of his award.
This prior approval will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to benefit the administration of the award, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment.
Beazley Annual Report 2007 47 Directors remuneration report continued Pensions All executive directors, except Andrew Horton, participated in the Beazley Furlonge Limited final salary pension scheme up to 31 March 2006 when it was decided that accruals for future service for all members of the scheme should cease.
Details of the entitlements for service accruals up to 31 March 2006 of those directors who participated in the final salary scheme during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Transfer value Increase in Accrued accrued benets Increase in of A less of accrued transfer value benefit at excluding accrued benets directors benets at less directors 31 Dec 2007 ination A including ination contributions 31 Dec 2007 contributions A F Beazley 222,321 4,218,994 278,451 N H Furlonge 139,243 2,917,985 52,773 J G Gray 26,623 1,132 536,673 113,261 N P Maidment 30,707 1,306 373,608 39,523 J G B Rowell 26,623 1,132 335,747 35,264 C A Washbourn 14,373 611 189,211 19,715 The increase in the transfer value for the past service entitlement of Andrew Beazley and Nicholas Furlonge reects the increase in pensionable salary and the change in discount rate used in the transfer value calculations.
The pension benets for directors and staff are now provided by way of a dened contribution scheme arranged through Fidelity, which is non-contributory.
The company contributes 15% of salary for directors.
Andrew Beazley and Nicholas Furlonge do not participate in this plan but, instead, receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension.
No other pension provisions are made.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.
Share incentive plans The company operates a variety of long-term, share-based incentives, including tax-approved and unapproved option plans, LTIP and a save-as-you-earn scheme SAYE, which are detailed below.
In 2005 it was agreed that in the future share option grants other than those under the Beazley SAYE scheme which have substantial tax advantages for participants are to be made only in exceptional circumstances, e. g. recruitment, when the terms of those share options will reect best practice prevailing at that time.
In particular, there will be no retesting of performance conditions on those grants.
Existing options will be honoured and allowed to run their full course.
The long-term incentive plan Participation in the LTIP is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley group.
Participants are selected on a discretionary basis, and receive awards of free shares in the form of a nil-cost option, thus, no exercise price is payable.
The options will normally be exercisable subject to meeting the performance conditions set out below and provided that the participant continues in the employment of the company at that date between the third and tenth anniversaries of grant.
The LTIP awards that were granted in March 2004 met the performance criteria established in part and 70% of the options vested.
The maximum normal levels of grants that may be made under the LTIP to one individual is one times salary in any financial year, measured by the value of ordinary shares put under award at the time of the award.
Dividends are not currently accrued on ordinary shares prior to vesting and the number of shares awarded is not therefore adjusted.
The committee will keep this issue under review for future awards.
Awards are measured by TSR and net asset value NAV performance.
The company decided upon these measures as TSR aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance and NAV is a key measure of the companys financial performance.
The LTIP performance conditions were originally set when the scheme was established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
The performance conditions were amended at an extraordinary general meeting on 14 March 2005 for grants made after that date.
com 2005 and Shares worth up to 50% of salary NAV future awards Basic Shares Regardless of the TSR performance, 50% of the Basic shares will be received if NAV growth is at least the risk free rate of return plus 5% per year.
TSR Regardless of the NAV growth, 25% of the Basic Shares will be received for median TSR performance and 50% of the Basic Shares will be received for upper quartile TSR performance.
For TSR performance between median and upper quartile the number of Basic Shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
Awards up Shares worth more than 50% NAV to 2004 of salary Regardless of TSR performance, 50% of the Additional Shares will be Additional Shares received if NAV growth is at least the risk-free rate of return plus 10% per year.
For out-performance of the risk-free rate of return of between 5% and 10%, the number of Additional Shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
TSR Regardless of NAV growth, 50% of the Additional Shares will be received if top decile TSR performance is achieved.
For TSR performance between upper quartile and top decile performance, the number of Additional Shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
The companys TSR growth is compared with that of members of a comparator group comprising 11 companies from the insurance sector the comparator group over a three-year period starting with the year in which the award is made.
The comparator group is dened as the Lloyds vehicles listed on the London Stock Exchange and includes the following companies for the 2007 awards: Alea Brit Insurance Hardy Kiln Amlin Catlin Group Highway Novae Group Atrium Chaucer Hiscox The comparator group has not changed from last year.
Details of entitlements under this plan, which are all subject to the above performance conditions, for directors who served during the period, are set out in the next table.
The pre-IPO plan Participation in the pre-IPO plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley group.
Participants were selected on a discretionary basis.
No payment is required for the grant of an option.
All options under the pre-IPO plan were granted on 6 November 2002 and no further grants are anticipated.
The performance conditions were met on 22 January 2007 and 75% of the awards vested.
Beazley Annual Report 2007 49 Directors remuneration report continued The unapproved share option plan Participation in the unapproved plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley group, although it is the committees intention to only make awards under this plan in exceptional circumstances.
Participants are selected on a discretionary basis.
No payment is required for the grant of an option and the limit on grants when aggregated with awards under the LTIP is shares with a face value of one times salary or twice salary in exceptional circumstances.
Under both the approved and unapproved share option plans, options are subject to performance conditions and typically vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided that the participant has remained in employment to that date.
The performance conditions require the companys NAV plus dividends per share growth to increase as follows over a three-year period: An option may be exercised over all ordinary shares under option if the cumulative growth in NAV plus dividends per share is equal to or exceeds the risk-free rate of return this being dened as the average yield of UK gilts with maturity dates within the next five years in the relevant period plus 10% per annum: An option may be exercised over half the ordinary shares under option if the cumulative growth in NAV plus dividends per share is equal to the risk-free rate of return plus 5% per annum: For performance where the cumulative growth in NAV plus dividends per share equals a number between the risk-free rate of return plus 5% and 10% per annum, the number of ordinary shares over which an option can be exercised will be calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points: For options granted before 2005, if the option is not fully exercisable at the end of the three-year period, it will be re-tested once, on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, from a xed base.
The option is exercisable over whichever is the higher number of options vesting.
No options have been granted since 2005: and The option will lapse if NAV plus dividends per share performance is below the risk-free rate of return plus 5% per annum in both periods.
The performance conditions above were set when these plans were established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
These performance conditions were considered to be appropriate as, they impose demanding performance requirements, while ensuring that shareholders also receive attractive returns over the performance period.
A proportion of the unapproved and approved options granted in 2003 vested following the announcement of the results for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the balance of the options lapsed.
The unapproved and approved options granted in 2004 vested in part following the announcement of the results for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the balance of the options are available to be re-tested following the announcement of the results for the year ended 31 December 2007 The approved share option plan Participation in the approved plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley group.
The terms and conditions are consistent with the unapproved plan, except that the plan has been approved by HMRC formerly known as the Inland Revenue.
 A SAYE scheme, administered by Yorkshire Bank plc, was launched in May 2003 for the benefit of staff.
The scheme rules were approved by HMRC.
The scheme offered a three-year savings contract period with options being offered at a price of 74p for grants in 2005, 93p for grants in 2006 and 114.5p for the grants in 2007 representing the maximum allowed discount of 20%.
Monthly contributions are made through payroll deduction directly to individual Yorkshire Bank accounts on behalf of participating employees.
All employees who had completed their probationary period prior to the closure of the invitation period were considered eligible to participate in the scheme.
Savings-related share option plan for US employees The Beazley Group plc savings-related share option plan for US employees the Plan permits all eligible US-based employees to purchase shares of Beazley group at a discount of up to 15% to the shares fair market value.
The plan is designed to comply with the terms of Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code.
A similar arrangement SAYE scheme is in place for UK-based Beazley group employees.
Approval is being sought from shareholders for the adoption of this Plan.
com Participants elect to participate by entering into a savings contract under which the participant agrees to have a portion of his or her compensation withheld in a savings plan for the purpose of exercising options granted under the Plan.
The maximum amount of compensation that may be withheld each month under all savings contracts for any participant may not exceed 250.
After a two-year period, participants may exercise their options to purchase Beazley shares at the exercise price.
The shares purchased are non-transferable for at least 12 months following exercise.
Unexercised options lapse 27 months after the date on which the options were granted.
Options may be exercised early in the event of an employees death or retirement, certain other cessations of employment and certain Beazley group change in control events.
The Plan, by its terms, will terminate on 5 May 2016, which is the tenth anniversary of its adoption.
The share plans permit 10% of the companys share capital to be issued pursuant to options LTIP awards in a 10-year period.
Since November 2002, 30% of this allowance 3.0% has been allocated for option and LTIP awards.
Directors share scheme interests Details of share options of those directors who served during the period are as follows: Ex.
As beneciaries of the employee benefit trust, the executive directors are deemed to be interested in the shares held by the trust which at 31 December 2007 amounted to 5,941,820 ordinary shares.
Underwriting interests on Syndicate 623 The incentive arrangements for directors and key decision makers in the busiiness include an element of downside risk through the deferment of future bonuses that will be at risk if the syndicate declares losses through the participation in Beazley Staff Underwriting.
To date over 100 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 5.4m of bonuses to the underwriting results of Syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 2.4m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.
The following directors participated in Syndicate 623 either directly through NameCos or indirectly through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited.
