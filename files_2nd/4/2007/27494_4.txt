14 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued SHARE MATCHING PLAN As a result of The Northern Rock plc Transfer Order 2008 all share schemes were extinguished on 22 February 2008.
This note therefore reflects the position of this share scheme as at 31 December 2007.

5 Mr Baker retired as an Executive Director on 16 November 2007.
6 Mr Bennett retired as an Executive Director on 31 January 2007.

Shares granted in January 2004 vested in January 2007 when the Companys share price was 11.98.
Executive Directors and certain other senior executives were entitled to elect for all or part of the after tax amount of their annual cash bonus to be used to acquire shares: alternatively they could elect to deposit their own shares.
The shares acquired or deposited were eligible under this scheme for additional Matching Shares at the end of a three-year period.
For 2004 and previous years, the release of Matching Shares was not dependent on satisfaction of a further performance condition.
For awards granted in 2005 and following years the release of Matching Shares would have been dependent on the Group achieving real EPS growth of 3% p. a. over the three years prior to their release.
As this growth target has not been met for the awards granted in 2005, these awards expired unexercised lapsed and will not become exercisable.
All remaining awards lapsed pursuant to the Transfer Order on 22 February 2008.

2007 awards were granted to Mr Applegarth, Mr Baker, Mr Jones, Mr Currie and Mr Kuipers under the new Share Matching Plan after the AGM based on a share price of 11.98 per share the share price prevailing on 26 January 2007 the normal date on which such awards would have been granted but for the requirement to obtain prior shareholder approval for the new scheme.
As explained on page 8, Mr Bennett received an award under the existing Bonus Matching Plan in January 2007.
Mr Applegarths rights under the scheme lapsed on 12 December 2007.
DEFERRED SHARE SCHEME As a result of The Northern Rock plc Transfer Order 2008 all share schemes were extinguished on 22 February 2008.
Following the approval of the new share scheme arrangements at the AGM in 2007, there were no further awards under the Deferred Share Scheme after the January 2007 awards to Mr Applegarth, Mr Baker, Mr Bennett, Mr Currie, Mr Jones and Mr Kuipers details of which are outlined below relating to the 2006 annual bonus.
10 Mr Applegarth retired on 12 December 2007.
11 Mr Baker retired as an Executive Director on 16 November 2007.
12 Mr Bennett retired as an Executive Director on 31 January 2007.
13 Mr Currie retired as an Executive Director on 16 November 2007.
14 Mr Jones was appointed as an Executive Director on 1 February 2007.
16 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Executive Directors and certain other senior executives who received a cash bonus were eligible under this scheme to receive deferred shares of an equivalent value.
Prior to 2005, the release of deferred share awards was not dependent on satisfaction of a further performance condition other than normally remaining in employment until the date of vesting because the value of deferred share awards was derived from annual bonus criteria and was therefore dependent on corporate performance.
For awards in 2005 and subsequent years the release of any deferred share awards became dependent on the Group achieving average real EPS growth of 3% p. a. over the three years prior to their release.
As this growth target has not been met for the awards granted in 2005, these awards have now expired unexercised lapsed and will not become exercisable.
The value, calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, of the awards is being charged to the income statement over the three-year period to which they relate.
In 2007 513,303 was credited to the income statement due to the lapsing of the awards granted in 2005 and a revision to the estimate of the number of rights that are expected to vest in future years 2006 charge of 1,367,302.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN As a result of The Northern Rock plc Transfer Order 2008 all share schemes were extinguished on 22 February 2008.
16 Mr Applegarth retired on 12 December 2007.
17 Mr Baker retired as an Executive Director on 16 November 2007.
18 Mr Bennett retired as an Executive Director on 31 January 2007.
19 Mr Currie retired as an Executive Director on 16 November 2007.
20 Mr Jones was appointed as an Executive Director on 1 February 2007.
17 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued The gross awards granted in 2004 shown above matured in January 2007 and led to the release of 43.3% of the shares originally awarded.
The remaining 56.7% of rights lapsed under the performance conditions of the scheme.
The Companys share price on the release date was 11.98.
There were no variations made in the terms and conditions of the plan interests during 2007.
Shares could only be released if strategic performance targets were achieved and if the participant remained in employment, except in certain good leaver circumstances.
In relation to awards granted in 2004 and previous years, performance was measured over a three year period on the basis of TSR, comparing the Companys performance with that of the other companies in the FTSE 350 Index at the date of the award.
For awards in 2005 and subsequent years, the Companys TSR would have been compared to that of other companies in the FTSE 100 Index at the date of the award.
See page 9 for further details.
As the performance criteria have not been met for the awards granted in January 2005, these awards have now lapsed.
A proportion of Mr Bennetts rights under the awards granted in 2006 and 2007 lapsed on his retirement in accordance with the terms of his retirement.
The value, calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, of these awards is being charged to the income statement over the three-year period to which they relate.
In 2007 1,281,053 was credited to the income statement due to the lapsing of the awards granted in 2005 and a revision to the estimate of the number of rights that are expected to vest in future years 2006 charge of 1,031,257.
PENSIONS Set out below are details of the pension benefits to which each of those individuals who were Executive Directors at some time during the financial year is entitled.

The increase in the accrued pension entitlement is the difference between the accrued pension entitlement at the year end and that at the previous year end.
The Listing Rules also require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent the sums payable to individual Directors or former Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
18 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued The increase in the transfer value less Directors or former Directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued pension entitlement during the year after deducting the Directors personal contributions to the scheme.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued pension entitlement, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued pension entitlement excluding inflation that the Director or former Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his transfer value, required by the Regulations, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in transfer values and thus includes the change in value of the accrued pension entitlement that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value over the year, as well as the value of the additional accrued pension entitlement earned in the year.
Including Mr Bennetts unfunded arrangement he has an estimated accrued annual pension entitlement at 31 December 2007 of 323,900.
As Mr Jones joined the Companys Pension Scheme after the cap on Pensionable Earnings and Final Pensionable Earnings was introduced by the Finance Act 1989, the Company provides him with arrangements to provide the difference between benefits based upon actual Final Pensionable Earnings and the scheme specific cap.
These benefits provided by the Company outside the Pension Scheme attract the same terms as those provided by the Scheme, save for the option to take a tax free lump sum at retirement.
This arrangement does not affect the level of contribution made to the scheme by Mr Jones, whose contributions are made by reference to full pensionable earnings.
As above, the pension benefits that are provided to Mr Jones, which accrue at the rate of 1 60th of pensionable salary for each year of service and pro rata for each part year are split between the Northern Rock Pension Scheme and an unfunded arrangement.
The pension scheme provides benefits up to an earnings cap, currently 108,600 for 2006 07 2005 06 105,600 per annum, whilst the unapproved arrangement provides benefits on earnings in excess of the cap.
Mr Jones contributes 5% of his basic salary to the pension scheme, including those earnings in excess of the earnings cap.
If, with the agreement of the Company, Mr Jones were to commute some of his unapproved pension for a lump sum at retirement, the Company would not reimburse Mr Jones for any taxes that are due on any such payment.
Mr Jones has also been awarded a pensionable service credit in the pension scheme in respect of a transfer payment that he brought into the scheme.
