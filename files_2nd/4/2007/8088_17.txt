Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The membership of the Remuneration Committee during 2007 was as follows: Period of membership 2007 P Kirby Chairman of Committee 1 Jan 31 Dec S Watson 1 Jan 31 Dec D Mapp 1 Jan 31 Dec R Hooper 1 Jan 15 May None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
In determining the Directors remuneration the Committee consulted the Chairman, about its proposals although no Director played a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee also engaged independent advisers New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBS to provide advice on the structure and operation of Directors remuneration packages and the Companys share incentive arrangements.
NBS do not provide any other services to the Group.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is prudently designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Groups performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
It rewards above-average performance and is designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as follows: basic annual salary: benefits: annual bonus: share incentives: and retirement and life assurance benefits.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salaries, together with the benefits of participation in performance-based share incentive schemes.
The Remuneration Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgment its remuneration policies do not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines that it is appropriate.
During 2006 Mr Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,000.
Mr Gilbertson served as Non-Executive Chairman of John Brown Holdings Limited, for which he received and retained fees of 30,000.
Mr Foye served as a Non-Executive Director of YouGov plc, for which he received and retained fees of 16,500.
60 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 Directors Remuneration Report continued Basic Salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective research which gives current information on appropriate comparator groups of companies.
A review at the end of 2007 was undertaken with the assistance of independent remuneration consultants NBS.
It included a comparison of benchmark data from three comparator groups of companies - one drawn from the FTSE All Share Media Index, of which the Company is a constituent member, a second drawn from the FTSE All Share Index which comprised companies of a broadly similar size to Informa in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and overseas operations and a third comprising the members of the old FTSE 350 Media & Entertainment Sector this group no longer exists following a reclassification by FTSE but is retained as a helpful third category for competitor purposes.
Following its review, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate to increase the annual basic salaries of the Chairman and Chief Executive with effect from 1 January 2008 to the following levels, which reflect the scale of the Groups business, their attendant responsibilities and their continued outstanding performance: 000 P Rigby, Chairman 630 D Gilbertson, Chief Executive 620 In addition, the salary of Mr Walker, the new Finance Director, was fixed at 425,000 p. a. for 2008.
Benefits Each of the Executive Directors receives a benefit allowance of 25,000 per annum together with private medical insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual Bonus Each of the Executive Directors has the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, subject to the achievement of challenging performance criteria set by the Committee.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2007, as in the previous year, a bonus of up to 80% of basic salary could be earned based on achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted earnings per share EPS targets and up to 20% based on achievement of personal objectives, covering strategic, financial and operational areas.
The Remuneration Committee determined that the EPS-related targets had been achieved in full and accordingly a bonus of 80% of basic salary was awarded to each of the Executive Directors.
In relation to the achievement of personal objectives, awards of 20% were made to Messrs Rigby and Foye and an award of 10% was paid to Mr Gilbertson in each case of their respective basic salaries.
The Remuneration Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement to determine performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders as this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors.
The Committee has determined for 2008 not to base any element of bonus on the achievement of personal objectives and instead has resolved that a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary be awarded.
The amount of the bonus will be dependent upon achievement of a sliding scale of diluted adjusted EPS for the year ending 31 December 2008 the targets of which are set at levels to encourage and reward the delivery of exceptional levels of performance.
Share Matching Plan In 2004 and 2005 the Company operated a Share Matching Plan in which the Executive Directors could participate.
Following approval at the 2004 Annual General Meeting, the Share Matching Plan was amended to introduce a requirement for the Executive Directors to invest at least 50% of their annual bonuses net of tax and any other deductions, where such bonus exceeded half of annual basic salary, in the Companys shares.
Corresponding awards of free matching shares were then made under the Share Matching Plan.
In addition, the requirement was introduced for performance criteria to be achieved in order for the free matching shares to vest.
Awards under the amended Share Matching Plan were made in April 2005, as set out on page 66.
No further grants will be made under this Plan.
Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 61 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long Term Incentive Plan As reported last year, following a review by the Remuneration Committee and after consultation with the Companys principal institutional shareholders undertaken at the beginning of 2006, the Committee concluded that the awards made to the Executive Directors in April 2005 should be the last made under the Share Matching Plan.
From 2006 the Executive Directors were invited to participate in the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which had been introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The first grant of awards to Executive Directors under the LTIP was made in March 2006 and they were given the alternative of: a maximum award of 100% of basic salary in the Companys shares, provided they are prepared to sacrifice 5% of that years basic salary: or a maximum award of 50% of basic salary in the Companys shares, with no salary sacrifice required.
The purpose of the higher award for a basic salary sacrifice is to encourage participants to share some of the risk for a greater level of potential benefit and also to help mitigate the cost to the Company of the LTIP.
All Executive Directors opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary.
A further grant of awards was made in April 2007 on the same basis and the Executive Directors again opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary.
The awards made to the Executive Directors under the LTIP vest subject to continued employment over a three-year performance period, including the year of award, and the satisfaction of performance conditions which require both that: the Companys Total Shareholder Return is at least at the median compared to the companies constituting, at grant, the FTSE All Share Media Index: and the Companys average adjusted diluted EPS grows by at least RPI plus 5% per annum for 20% of the award to vest increasing to RPI plus 12% per annum for 100% of the award to vest.
The Committee reviewed these performance conditions at the end of 2007, having taken advice from NBS.
As a result, it concluded that the structure and levels of these performance conditions continue to be appropriate, given i the Companys current circumstances, ii comparative market practice and iii as they encourage both the generation of above market returns to shareholders and the delivery of substantial EPS growth.
Share Incentive Plan From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The SIP is an Inland Revenue Approved All Employee Share Incentive Plan which offers UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per annum out of pre-tax salary.
Share Options Prior to their merger in May 2004, both Informa and Taylor & Francis operated discretionary share option schemes for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
In the light of changes to the accounting treatment for share options and changing market practice, the Remuneration Committee decided not to grant options to Executive Directors during 2005 and 2006 and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future.
Details of subsisting options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 66.
Share Ownership Guidelines During early 2006 the Remuneration Committee introduced formal share ownership guidelines requiring the Executive Directors to build up, over a three-year period and with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account, a holding in the Companys shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary.
62 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 Directors Remuneration Report continued Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
Mr Gilbertson is a deferred member of the Informa Final Salary Scheme, a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary at the age of 60.
Dependants are eligible for dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of the members death in service.
Further details of the benefits accrued under the scheme are shown on page 67.
Mr Foye ceased to be an active member of the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme in April 2006.
This is a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary at the age of 63.
Since 1 none of the Executive Directors is an active member of any Group pension scheme and 2 none is eligible to make further tax efficient pension contributions, instead the Company now pays each of them a monthly payment in lieu of pension contributions equal to 25% of basic salary after deducting any incremental National Insurance costs to the Company.
Performance Graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by total shareholder return, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2007.
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of that index.

In the event of early termination, the contracts for Mr Rigby and Mr Gilbertson provide for compensation equal to basic salary, bonus, benefits allowance and retirement benefit for the notice period.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required to reflect changes to, for example, salary or fee levels.
