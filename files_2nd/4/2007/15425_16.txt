With effect from 1 September 2004, a restriction Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 51 Governance Remuneration Report continued Directors contracts It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts of employment providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Service contracts for all Executive Directors and letters of appointment for all Non Executive Directors are available for inspection as described in the Notice of 2008 Annual General Meeting.
Details of the Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Notice periods Notice periods Normal Date of Unexpired term by Company by Director retirement Current Name contract months months months age age Pete Redfern 13 October 2004 12 12 12 60 37 Peter Johnson 1 November 2002 12 12 12 60 53 Ian Sutcliffe 23 January 2006 12 12 12 60 48 Proposed for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
Following the Merger, the service agreements in place between George Wimpey Plc and Messrs Redfern and Sutcliffe were amended so that each agreement is now between the Company and the Executive.
It is the Companys policy that liquidated damages should not automatically apply on the termination of an Executive Directors contract.
In accordance with this approach, payment for early termination of contract without cause by the Company is, in the case of each of the Executive Directors, to be determined having regard to normal principles of English law, which requires mitigation of liability on a case-by-case basis.
Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main elements of a Directors remuneration, namely: salary: bonus entitlement: benets-in-kind: and pension entitlements.
The service agreement of Ian Sutcliffe contains a provision which allows him to terminate the agreement within 6 months of a change of ownership of the Company by 3 months notice.
In such a case, Ian Sutcliffe would be entitled to receive a payment of 12 months notice and benets.
Treatment of awards under any long term incentive plan would be subject to the rules of the applicable plan which are compliant with guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies with regard to their treatment in the event of a change of control.
Since the Merger, the Company has re-confirmed its policy that service agreements for Executive Directors who join the Board will not contain any change of control provisions.
Non Executive Directors No Non Executive Director has a service contract, as their terms of engagement are regulated by letters of appointment as follows: Notice period by Notice period by Date of appointment Date of initial letter Term of Company Director as a director of appointment appointment months months Norman Askew 29 July 2003 25 July 2003 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 Mike Davies 13 October 2003 29 September 2003 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 Brenda Dean 3 July 2007 21 November 2007 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 Andrew Dougal 18 November 2002 31 October 2002 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 Katherine Innes Ker 1 July 2001 21 May 2001 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 Anthony Reading 3 July 2007 21 November 2007 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 David Williams 3 July 2007 21 November 2007 3 year, reviewed annually 6 6 Proposed for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
Brenda Dean, Anthony Reading and David Williams were appointed to the Board upon completion of the Merger and each entered into a new contract for service.
All three Directors were formerly Directors of George Wimpey Plc.
Following the Merger the notice periods of the Chairman and the Non Executive Directors were standardised at 6 months either way.
The fees of Non Executive Directors were determined by the Board in their absence taking into account the research carried out by Mercer of fees paid to Non Executive Directors of similar sized companies and the Sector Based Peer Group.
Non Executive Director fees are subject to the aggregate annual limit of 1,000,000 imposed by the Articles of Association and will be reviewed annually.
The basic fees of each Non Executive Director were reviewed following the Merger and were standardised at 50,000 per annum from 45,000.

The performance criteria relating to the Deferred Bonus Plan appear earlier in this Directors Remuneration Report.
These plans replaced the Executive Bonus Plan and Executive Share Option Plan, which were subject to EPSrelated performance conditions.
Awards vesting under the Executive Bonus Plan in 2007 achieved the EPS-related performance conditions and were consequently able to be exercised in full.

Awards made pursuant to the George Wimpey LTIP are conditional and do not vest in whole or part unless predetermined performance conditions are satisfied over a three year period.
The performance conditions are explained in detail on page 49.
The number of awards made to each participant is calculated with reference to a formula based on a maximum of 2 x salary as at 1 January in each year and the average closing share price for each dealing day within a 90 day period ending on the day before the award is made.
