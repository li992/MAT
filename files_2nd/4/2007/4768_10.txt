MAC RF63322 A 8 4 08 08:18 Page 23 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 23 Report on Directors remuneration for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together with disclosures on all Directors remuneration.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the 2006 Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period except that, the annual bonus awarded to the Chief Executive is pensionable.
He is however not a member of the Group pension scheme and maintains his own personal pension scheme.
As a consequence there is no impact on the Groups pension scheme.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are James Newman and the NonExecutive Chairman, Richard Connell.
The Code requires that a Group of this size has a Remuneration Committee with a minimum of two members.
The Chairman is specifically excluded from discussions regarding his remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no daytoday involvement in running the business.
The Chief Executive attended Remuneration Committee meetings when required and Richard Portman attended meetings as Company Secretary and hence Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference.
A copy of the terms of reference is available for inspection on the Groups investor website www.
The Committee met five times during 2007.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for directors were also agreed as were options granted under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2006 performance related bonus and the vesting of the options granted under the LTIP scheme in 2004.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees policy has been to progressively set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration at the following quartiles in comparison to a comparable group of companies the Comparator Group : Basic salary median.
Annual bonus potential median to upper quartile.
Share incentives median to upper quartile.
Total compensation median to upper quartile.
The Comparator Group is a group of 20 companies with similar corporate attributes to the Group such as market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees.
However, since the Group was promoted to the FTSE 250 in December 2007 and given the lack of any clear peer group, it is the intention of the Committee to, in the future, set the elements of the remuneration package by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Align rewards with the interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance, which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on the measurable delivery of strong financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that performance.
Only 31 per cent of each Executive Directors total remuneration package ignoring benefits and pension contributions is accounted for by basic salary assuming a full annual related bonus is achieved and a maximum conditional award under the LTIP is made.
MAC RF63322 A 8 4 08 08:18 Page 24 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 24 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Groups objectives and shareholders interests.
Basic salary No significant changes were made to the Executive Directors basic salaries during the period.
Available market information and Comparator Group information was reviewed during the period to ensure that basic salaries remained appropriate and competitive given the roles and responsibilities of each individual Director.
When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity: The performance of the individual Executive Director: The individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and Pay and conditions throughout the Group.
Annual performance related bonus The Committees policy during the period was to set the maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors between the median and the upper quartile in relation to the Comparator Group.
The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board.
The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2007 by Executive Directors was 100 per cent of basic salary.
A bonus of 70 per cent is attainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of 30 per cent may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target.
The increase in underlying earnings per share during the period was 26 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive Directors in the period was 100 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
Share incentives Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP on 31 March 2004 prior to admission to the London Stock Exchange on 8 April 2004.
If existing LTIPs were to be amended or if there was a new LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee reviews awards each year to Executive Directors at the median to upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards under the LTIP.
Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of salary.
All four Executive Directors, serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during 2007 equivalent to the maximum award.
The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years, mindful of the need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant proportion of their total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group.
This award is in addition to those granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Richard Portman, prior to his appointment to the Board, received a conditional share award in 2006 equal to 100 per cent of his salary.
Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the scheme are shown on page 28.
Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR as the performance condition for LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperform the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value, before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The constituent companies of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, were selected as a benchmark as there are no directly comparable quoted companies in the UK and the enterprise value of the Group debt plus equity gives it a comparative value to FTSE 350 companies.
The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the scheme and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award.
Performance conditions under the LTIP are not subject to re testing.
MAC RF63322 A 8 4 08 08:18 Page 25 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 25 The percentage of the conditional share award exercisable or vesting is calculated as follows: Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award.
Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award.
Ranked between median and top quintile: straightline apportionment.
The Remuneration Committee has set the percentage of conditional awards exercisable at 40 per cent for median performance.
This is based on the Committees assessment of an appropriate and necessary award for achieving such a performance after considering all elements of the total remuneration package.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the measurement period.
The graph shows the Groups TSR compared to the FTSE 350.
This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any conditional award vesting.
Total Shareholder Return 250% 225% 200% 175% 150% 125% 100% 75% 50% 25% 0% Dignity plc FTSE 350 Index On 8 April 2007 the conditional share awards made in 2004 under the LTIP became capable of vesting.
The TSR of the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the time the awards were made.
The performance of the Group was found to be in the top quintile.
On that basis the Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that the entire 2004 share award vest and be issued to the relevant Directors.
The shares were issued to the Directors on 11 April 2007 and sold in their entirety the following day by the Groups brokers.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on page 28 in the section of the Remuneration Committees Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans.
In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only issue 5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
At the period end, conditional awards under the LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.28 per cent of the current issued share capital.
If the awards made in 2004, that have just vested, are included that percentage is 1.87 per cent.
The total including SAYE options granted in both the 2004 and 2007 Schemes is 3.36 per cent.
Pensions The Group provides Peter Hindley with a contribution to his personal pension plan of 10 per cent of his salary and any bonus payable.
As this is a personal pension plan any pension contributions paid on a bonus do not affect the Groups pension scheme.
Mike McCollum and Richard Portman are members of the Groups pension scheme into which the Group contributed 10.5 per cent of salary details are set out within the audited section of this report on page 27.
The Group makes no pension contributions for Andrew Davies.
No NonExecutive Directors receive any pension contributions.
Benefits in kind Benefits included the following elements: provision of a company car or allowance, fuel, landline telephone at each Executive Directors home residence and a mobile telephone together with a prearranged funeral plan in accordance with any scheme established by the Group in respect of the funeral of the Executive Director or his wife.
All Executive Directors received all of their benefits in kind.

The Board determines the fees of the NonExecutive Directors.
It is based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive.
The level of fees of the NonExecutive Directors reflects the time commitment and responsibility of their respective roles.
In future, their fees will be set by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
No Executive Directors hold a NonExecutive position with any other company.
However, the Group encourages one such appointment per Executive Director.
