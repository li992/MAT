Statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee - an overview The remuneration report was prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the board.
The board believes that a properly constituted and effective remuneration committee is key to improving the link between directors' pay and performance, with the ultimate aim of enhancing our competitiveness.
The primary purpose of the committee is to determine our policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the remuneration package for each executive director.
The committee is made up of non-executive directors, and executive directors are not involved in determining their own remuneration packages.
This report describes our remuneration policy which has remained unchanged and directors' remuneration for the 2007 financial year.
During the period, in addition to its regular business, the committee continued to focus specifically on: Talent management and the retention of senior management and executives.
The appropriateness of the quantum of, and balance between, fixed and variable remuneration for executive directors.
The appropriateness of the various share option and long-term incentive plans currently in place, including inter alia, grant levels, dilution limits, performance criteria and vesting schedules.
Key points to note for the period under review include: Our total shareholder return was 15.4% for Investec plc in Pounds Sterling and 53.3% for Investec Limited in Rands.
This compares to a return of 20.5% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
Since listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, Investec plc has significantly outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index see graph on page 130.
Investec has performed strongly in the current financial year with adjusted earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders before goodwill and non-operating items increasing by 30.7% to 300.7 million 2006: 230.0 million.
This performance has been recognised in the remuneration decisions at all levels.
121 Executive directors hold 1.9% and 3.3% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively.
Non-executive directors hold 0.9% and 5.1% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively see table on page 133.
The report complies with the provisions of the 2006 London Combined Code, Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985, the UK Financial Services Authority Listing Rules, the South African King II Code of Corporate Practice and Conduct and the JSE Limited Listing Rules.
Additional information has also been included to reflect the most common enquiries received.
Furthermore, the auditors are of the opinion that the auditable part of this report on pages 131 to 138 was properly prepared, in accordance with Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985.
The committee unanimously recommends that you vote to approve this report at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
Signed on behalf of the board George Alford Chairman, Remuneration Committee 15 June 2007 Remuneration report Composition and role of the committee The members of the Remuneration Committee throughout the year were George Alford Chairman, Geoffrey Howe and Sir Chips Keswick.
The members are independent non-executive directors and are free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The committee's principal responsibilities and objectives are to: Determine and agree with the board, the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of executive directors and executive management comprising individuals discharging managerial responsibilities who are the global heads of our core areas of activity and are members of our global operations forum.
Ensure that qualified and experienced management and executives will be provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and will be, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their contribution to our performance.
Determine targets and objectives for any performance related pay schemes for directors and executive management.
Determine, within the terms of the agreed policy, the total individual remuneration packages of executive directors and executive management including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share scheme awards.
Oversee any major changes in our employee benefit structures.
Ensure that the comments, recommendations and rules within the UK and South Africa pertaining to director's remuneration are given due regard, in determining the packages of executive directors.
The committee is authorised by the board to seek any information it requires from any employee in order to perform its duties.
The committee's terms of reference are available on our website.
Meetings The committee met six times during the financial year with full attendance other than for two meetings which Sir Chips Keswick was unable to attend.
The Company Secretary of Investec plc acts as Secretary to the committee.
Executive directors do not attend these 122 meetings, although the Chairman of the board has attended on one occasion.
The Chairman of the committee reports on the activities of the committee at each meeting of the full board.
Advisers to the committee Where appropriate, the committee has access to independent executive remuneration consultants.
The selection of the advisers is at the discretion of the committee Chairman, and Investec funds any expenses relating to the appointment of external consultants.
During the financial year, the committee continued to use the services of its advisers, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, which: Benchmarked, reviewed and provided advice on competitive levels and forms of pay salaries and bonuses for the executive directors.
Benchmarked, reviewed and provided advice on competitive levels of pay for the non-executive directors.
Furthermore, we have used the services of Linklaters, which have advised on a number of issues pertaining to our incentive plans.
Linklaters is one of Investec plc's legal advisers.
Certain specialist divisions within the group, for example, Human Resources and the Staff Shares division, provide supporting information and documentation relating to matters that are presented to the committee.
This includes, for example, comparative data and motivations for proposed salary, bonus and share awards.
The employees within these specialist divisions, which provide support to the committee, are not board directors and are not appointed by the committee.
While executive directors have the right to address any meeting of the committee, they play no role in the determination of their remuneration package or that of any other executive director.
Remuneration report Policy on executive directors' and employees' remuneration Our philosophy is to employ the highest calibre individuals, who are characterised by integrity, intellect and innovation and who adhere and subscribe to our culture, values and philosophies.
We strive to inspire entrepreneurship by providing a working environment that stimulates extraordinary performance, so that executive directors and employees may be positive contributors to our clients, their communities and us.
We reward executive directors and employees for their contribution through payment of an industry competitive annual package, a variable performance reward and ownership in the form of share incentive scheme participation.
Overall rewards are considered as important as our core values of work content greater responsibility, variety of work and high level of challenge and work affiliation entrepreneurial feel to the company and unique culture in the attraction, retention and motivation of employees.
We have a strong entrepreneurial, merit and values-based culture, characterised by passion, energy and stamina.
The ability to live and perpetuate our values, culture and philosophies in the pursuit of excellence is considered paramount in determining overall reward levels.
Both the type of people the organisation attracts, and the culture and environment within which they work, remain crucial in determining our success and long-term progress.
The key principles of our remuneration policy for executive directors and employees, which were consistently applied during the financial year, are as follows: Reward programmes are designed and administered to align directors' and employees' interests with those of stakeholders.
Reward programmes are clear and transparent, in order to retain individual interest in, and identification with, our short and longterm success.
Total rewards comprise a fixed and variable component.
Total compensation base salary, pension, benefits and incentives is targeted to the relevant competitive market see below at upper quartile levels for superior performance.
123 A significant proportion of rewards, including annual and long-term incentive components, are explicitly linked to the performance of the business and the individual business units.
We recognise the performance of the business and the individual.
As indicated above, qualitative and quantitative issues form an integral part of the determination of reward levels.
Reward levels are targeted to be commercially competitive, on the following basis: - The most relevant competitive reference points for reward levels are based on the scope of responsibility and individual contributions made.
- Appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations' remuneration practices are reviewed regularly.
- For executive directors, the FTSE 350 General Finance firms provide the most appropriate benchmark.
- For employees, a combination of firms from the JSE Financial 15 and the FTSE 350 General Finance sector offer the most appropriate benchmark.
- The committee also reviews on an individual basis data on other international banks with whom we compete.
- The committee recognises that we operate an international business and compete with both local and international competitors in each of our markets.
- In order to avoid disproportionate packages across areas of the group and between executives, adjustments are made at any extremes to ensure broad internal consistency.
Adjustments may also be made to the competitive positioning of pay components for individuals, in cases where a higher level of investment is needed in order to build or grow either a business unit or our capability in a geography.
Remuneration report Policy on non-executive directors' remuneration The board agrees and determines the fees of non-executive directors and the fees are reviewed annually.
The board's policy is that fees should reflect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees.
The fee structure covers the dual roles that the directors perform for the UK listed Investec plc and the South African listed Investec Limited boards.
The fee structure for nonexecutive directors except the Chairman for the 2007 and 2008 financial years is shown below: Non-executive directors' remuneration 2007 financial year As approved by the board for the 2008 financial year Basic fee 45 000 per year 50 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Audit Committee 35 000 per year 40 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Remuneration Committee 30 000 per year 30 000 per year Member of the DLC Audit Committee 12 000 per year 12 500 per year Member of the DLC Remuneration Committee 12 000 per year 12 000 per year Member of Investec Bank UK Limited board 8 000 per year 8 500 per year Member of the Investec Bank Limited board R20 000 per meeting R22 500 per meeting Fees are also payable for any additional time committed to the group including attendance at certain other meetings During the 2007 financial year, the Chairman received a total fee of 340 000 for his services as a director and it is intended that he will receive 340 000 for the 2008 financial year.
Non-executive directors may not participate in our share option plans or our long-term share incentive and pension plans.
Prior to 124 the implementation of our Dual Listed Companies DLC structure in July 2002, certain non-executive directors did participate in Investec Group Limited's now Investec Limited's leveraged equity plans.
There is no requirement for non-executive directors to hold shares in the company.
The company has left this choice to the discretion of the non-executive director.
Service contracts and terms of employment Our executive directors have indefinite contracts of employment, terminable by either party giving six months' written notice to the other.
Each executive director is entitled to receive a basic salary and is also eligible for an annual bonus, the amount of which will be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Furthermore, the executive directors may elect to sacrifice a portion of their annual salary to receive company benefits such as a travel allowance and medical aid.
The full costs of these benefits will be deducted from their annual salary.
The contracts of employment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Executive directors are permitted to accept outside appointments on external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the Company.
Any fees earned by executives in this regard are not retained and are given back to the respective companies.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and letters of appointment confirm the terms and conditions of their service.
The letters of appointment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Unless the non-executive directors resign earlier or are removed from their positions, they will remain appointed as directors until the close of our annual general meeting in 2008 subject to rotational re-election as directors at the 2007 meeting and in terms of the provision of the Articles of Association.
All non-executive directors who have been members of the board for longer than nine years are subject to annual reelection and a resolution will be proposed at the 2007 Annual General Meeting to incorporate this commitment into our Articles of Association.
Those directors seeking rotational re-election at the 2007 Annual General Meeting are shown on page 109.
Biographical details of the directors of the board These details can be found on pages 145 to 148.
Remuneration report Dates of appointment to the board The boards of Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate and subject to separate legal obligations for each company.
In terms of the DLC arrangements, they comprise the same persons who are authorised, as boards, to manage Investec as if it were a unified economic enterprise.
Details on the dates the directors were appointed to the board can be found on page 109.
Policies on the components of remuneration and employment The reward package for executive directors and employees comprises: Base salary and benefits.
The committee reviews the elements of the reward package relative to appropriate benchmarks and other comparable organisations, the contribution by the individual and the business as a whole, the value of individuals in perpetuating our values and culture, and the possible replacement cost of such individuals.
The elements of the reward package, as listed above, are discussed below and the components for each director are detailed in tables accompanying this report.
Base salary and benefits Salaries are reviewed annually and reflect the relative skills and experience of, and contribution made by, the individual.
Benefits are targeted at competitive levels and are delivered through flexible and tailored packages.
Benefits include pension schemes: 125 life, disability and personal accident insurance: medical cover: and other benefits, as dictated by competitive local market practices.
Only salaries are pensionable, the annual bonuses paid are not pensionable.
Our disclosure of executive directors' salaries on page 131 has been done on a gross basis i. e. inclusive of pension fund contributions from the company.
It is the company's policy to seek to set base salaries including benefits at median market levels.
However, base salaries have in many instances dropped below this level as annual increases in the recent past have largely been in line with prevailing inflation rates and have not been increased to median market levels due to a desire, in current circumstances, to maintain a low level of fixed costs.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are closely linked to business performance, based on target business unit performance goals determined in the main by Economic Value Added EVA profit performance against pre-determined targets.
These targets have been in force, and unchanged, for the past few years and are subject to periodic review, with varying levels of return required for each business unit reflecting the state of market maturity, country of operation, risk, capital invested capital intensive businesses or expected expense base fee based businesses.
Individual annual incentive levels are allocated from the EVA pool, based on individual performance, as determined by the committee.
Furthermore, as discussed previously, qualitative issues are integral in the determination of annual bonuses.
In this regard, if business and individual performance goals are achieved or bettered, the variable element of the total reward package is likely to be substantially higher than the relevant target market given that base salaries are currently below median market levels.
This is to ensure that overall reward levels are positioned at the upper quartile level for superior performance, in line with our overriding remuneration policy.
Executive remuneration structure - assessing the balance between fixed and variable remuneration As explained in the prior year's report, the committee undertook a thorough assessment of the executive remuneration structure which resulted in the removal of the annual bonus limit.
This practice was maintained during the 2007 financial year.
The following points are worth noting in this regard: Based on input from the committee's external advisors during the financial year it is evident that base salaries of executive director have remained below the median external market levels.
The committee remains reluctant to significantly increase the fixed component of the executives' remuneration package, due to a desire to maintain a low level of fixed costs and to ensure that fixed cost increases for executives remain in line with other employees across the group.
Remuneration report In conjunction with this view, and based on the committee's belief of delivering a significant proportion of rewards linked to the performance of the business, the objective of upper quartile levels of total compensation for superior performance will still be achieved through higher performance linked variable pay.
The committee thus still believes that an upper limit on the bonus award is inappropriate given the remuneration practices within the group and in similar financial services businesses.
The remuneration packages of the executive directors for the 2007 financial year have been determined in accordance with this philosophy.
Our policy remains to target at median salaries and upper quartile for total compensation in order to limit the increase in fixed costs.
Share option and long-term share incentive plans We have a number of share option and long-term share incentive plans that are designed to link the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders and long-term organisational interests, through performance and risk-based equity grants.
Prior to the implementation of our DLC structure and our listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002, we had a number of share option, share purchase and leveraged share schemes in place that were appropriate for a South African listed company.
However, at the time of the London listing it was necessary for us to consider implementing a more internationally recognised share scheme structure and philosophy.
As a result, a number of share option plans were introduced to cater for regulatory, tax and other considerations pertaining to the various jurisdictions in which we operated.
At the same time, however, a decision was taken to maintain the schemes that were in place prior to the London listing until the allocations made in terms of those schemes matured.
While this gives rise to what appears to be a multitude of schemes, the philosophy and practical implications are fairly simple - the appropriate level of equity allocation is determined for each employee and then awards are made out of the scheme that is considered most appropriate for that individual given his her location, tax and regulatory environment.
The share option and long-term share incentive plans in operation, and in which the directors are eligible to participate, are summarised in the table below and further details are provided on our website.
126 During the 2006 financial year the committee implemented the Share Matching Plan 2005 which was approved by shareholders in November 2005.
As a result, the committee does not currently intend to grant further options to executive directors under the other existing share option plans.
Executive directors collectively hold approximately 2.4% of our issued share capital.
Leveraged equity plans A group of senior and executive managers, including certain Investec plc Investec Limited directors, who have or can have a significant impact on the business, were granted participation prior to the implementation of the DLC structure in a leveraged equity plan known as Fintique II, which was established in 1996.
Further details on Fintique II are provided in tables accompanying this report and on our website.

2 These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share EPS over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI, plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the committee considered the merits of EPS-based targets against other possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in return on average shareholders' funds ROE against a basket of other companies.
The committee determined that EPSbased targets are most appropriate as they measure our underlying growth.
The committee intends to continue to apply this during the 2008 financial year but keeps the whole matter of the suitability of target-linked share based remuneration under periodic review.
This note does not apply to the Share Matching Plan 2005 which has different performance conditions as approved by shareholders further information is available on our website.
3 This represents the number of options issued to all participants.
For further details, see the Directors' Report on page 155.
More details on the directors' shareholdings are also provided in tables accompanying this report.
4 Dilution limits: Investec is committed to following the Association of British Insurers' ABI guidelines and accordingly, as from the date of the implementation of our DLC structure 29 July 2002, the maximum number of new shares which may be issued by the company under all of the share plans in respect of grants made after July 2002 may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the company over a rolling ten year period.
The committee regularly monitors the utilisation of dilution limits and available headroom to ensure that these guidelines are complied with.
The issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited at 31 March 2007 was 381.6 million shares and 227.7 million shares, respectively.
As announced on the stock exchange news services, 8.4 million Investec plc and 7.7 million Investec Limited shares were issued to the staff share schemes during the year.
5 The market price of an Investec plc share as at 31 March 2007 was 6.58 2006: 5.88, ranging from a low of 4.95 to a high of 6.76 during the financial year.
6 The market price of an Investec Limited share as at 31 March 2007 was R93.30 2006: R62.60, ranging from a low of R59.06 to a high of R94.60 during the financial year.
7 The rules of these long-term incentive plans do not allow Investec to issue new shares to the plan to satisfy any awards made to participants, nor may awards be made to executive directors.
Remuneration report Performance graph total shareholder return We have implemented a DLC structure, in terms of which we have primary listings in London and Johannesburg.
The listing on the London Stock Exchange LSE took place on 29 July 2002, although we have been listed in South Africa since 1986.
Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985 requires this report to include a performance graph of Investec plc's total shareholder return TSR performance against that of a broad market index.
We found it difficult to locate an appropriate group of companies to benchmark ourselves against because of our specialist activities.
A number of companies within the FTSE 350 General Finance Index conduct similar activities to us, although they do not necessarily have the same geographical profile.
Nevertheless, we believe that this is the most appropriate index against which to measure our performance on the LSE.
The graph below shows the cumulative shareholder return for a holding of our shares in blue in Pounds Sterling on the LSE, compared to the average total shareholder return of other members of the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
It shows that, at 31 March 2007, a hypothetical 100 invested in Investec plc at the time of its listing on the LSE in July 2002 would have generated a total return of 549, compared with a return of 208 if invested in the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
Investec plc has therefore outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index over the period.
During the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007, the return to shareholders of Investec plc measured in Pounds Sterling and Investec Limited measured in Rands was 15.4% and 53.3%, respectively.
The market price of our shares on the LSE was 6.58 as at 31 March 2007, ranging from a low of 4.95 to a high of 6.76 during the financial year.
Furthermore, the market price of our shares on the JSE Limited was R93.30 as at 31 March 2007, ranging from a low of R59.06 to a high of R94.60 during the financial year.

The information for Investec plc, is however, only available since its listing on the LSE in July 2002.
2 Gross remuneration of S Koseff, B Kantor and A Tapnack has increased on average by approximately 5.0%.
The gross remuneration of GR Burger is determined in Rands and converted into Pounds Sterling, thus the decline in his gross remuneration as reflected in Pounds Sterling is as a result of Rand depreciation.
In Rand terms GR Burger's gross remuneration increased by 6.8% from R2 458 000 to R2 625 000.
Gross remuneration increases for other employees across the group have generally been in the range of 4% to 10%, and the increases awarded to executive directors are consistent with this.
3 The executive directors receive other benefits which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
4 Executive directors' bonuses reflect the significant improvement in adjusted earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders before goodwill and non-operating items of 30.7% to 300.7 million, the improvement in the return to shareholders of Investec plc and Investec Limited of 15.4% Pounds Sterling and 53.3% Rands, respectively, and individual contribution to the group's performance.
