Remuneration report UNAUDITED INFORMATION Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee The Company complies with the relevant conditions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance relating to Directors remuneration as published by the London Stock Exchange and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Andrew Walker is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the other members are Christopher Bailey and Ian Griffiths.
All three members are independent non-executive Directors.
David Jeffcoat is secretary to the Committee.
Julian Blogh and Douglas Caster also normally attend Committee meetings, although they are formally not Committee members.
The remit of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of senior executive remuneration and to determine annually the individual salaries, annual bonuses payable if any, Long Term Incentive Plan awards and other terms and conditions of employment of the executive Directors.
Subject to shareholder approval, the Committee also agrees the terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive Directors and senior executives may be invited to participate, and the terms of the Companys Savings Related Share Option Scheme and All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP.
They are appointed by the Company and provided no other services to the Company during the year, save for ongoing advice in connection with the operation of the Companys share schemes.
In addition the Committee consults Douglas Caster, Chief Executive, with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages offered to executive Directors and senior executives during the year, except in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package which is determined by the Committee in his absence.
Remuneration policy The Companys remuneration policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling the Company to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre, whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments.
Further details of the remuneration policy applied by the Committee are set out below.
The remuneration practices adopted by a group of equivalent companies that, in the opinion of the Committee, face similar remuneration issues to the Company, are considered with guidance from New Bridge Street Consultants.
The size and nature of each key element of the remuneration package of the executive Directors is determined following this assessment.
It is the aim of the remuneration policy to encourage and reward high performance.
The Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by setting a moderate level of fixed pay, while providing competitive potential levels of total remuneration through short and longer term incentive arrangements that require the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions.
Therefore, a significant proportion of the executive Directors remuneration is performance-linked.
Salaries The executive Directors salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee.
In addition to the analysis presented by New Bridge Street Consultants, the Committee uses published salary surveys and information available in the annual reports of similar companies as sources of salary information.
Specific factors taken into account by the Committee when determining each executive Directors base salary are: the median level of base salary for a similar position within a like group of companies: the individual Directors performance: and his responsibilities.
The Chairmans remuneration is set by the Committee, which meets without him for this purpose.
The remaining non-executive Directors fees are set by a Committee comprising the executive Directors.
In all cases the remuneration awards are based upon published salary surveys, taking account of individual responsibilities.
Andrew Walker is Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and receives additional remuneration as a result.
Annual bonus scheme Bonus payments are based upon the achievement of operating profit and cash flow targets.
The maximum bonus for executive Directors is 75% of base salary.
In 2007, a maximum of 15% of salary could have been paid subject to the achievement of a 63.1m profit before tax and profit or loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition and a maximum of 60% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 61.4m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure and purchase of long-term incentive plan shares.
The actual results for the year led to a bonus pay-out of 31%.
The pay-out was below the maximum because both profit and cash performance were below the defined target levels.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 37 Corporate governance Remuneration report continued Annual bonus scheme continued The Committee will continue to ensure that the targets set under the annual bonus plan remain sufficiently stretching.
In 2008, the parameters used to assess payment will be based once again on a combination of a profit target, which will account for up to 15% of salary, and a cash flow objective for the remaining 60%.
Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan and Employee Share Option Plans Due to the expiry of a number of the Companys existing share incentive plans, Ultra sought and gained shareholder approval for the establishment of the following new discretionary share plans at the 2007 Annual General Meeting: the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP : the 2007 Company Share Option Plan 2007 CSOP : and the 2007 Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS.
2007 LTIP The sole form of equity-based long-term incentive for Executive Directors is the 2007 LTIP.
They do not receive awards under the 2007 CSOP or 2007 ESOS schemes, which provide incentives for less senior employees.
Most of the key features of the previous scheme were reflected in the new 2007 LTIP as approved by the shareholders.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the LTIP scheme has helped to motivate senior executives to drive sustained above-market long-term growth in Ultras profits and to generate excellent returns for shareholders as a result.
In designing the new 2007 LTIP, account was taken of changes in best market practice since the previous plan was approved by shareholders.
Proposed change to performance condition for outstanding LTIP awards Under the 2007 LTIP, conditional awards of shares are made annually to Executive Directors and selected other senior executives that normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the extent to which a performance condition has been met.
The performance condition originally approved by shareholders was the growth in Ultras adjusted EPS relative to a group of comparator companies over a fixed three-year period.
The intention was that, at the end of the performance period, each companys growth in EPS would be calculated over that period, with the companies ranked in descending order according to the growth in their adjusted EPS.
However, after careful consideration, the Remuneration Committee intends, subject to shareholder approval, which will be sought at the forthcoming AGM, to change this methodology for all awards made under the new 2007 LTIP including the award which was granted in 2007.
The intention is to replace the relative EPS-based performance condition with a relative TSR condition.
The main reason for this change is that assessing the relative EPS performance of the company has become much more complicated and difficult than in the past.
This problem has been exacerbated by the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS with effect from 2004, the first year of the award that vested at the end of 2006.
As a result the calculation of relative EPS now involves a very detailed review of the Annual Report & Accounts for all of the peer group companies in order to determine the necessary adjustments for factors such as the amortisation of intangibles, gains and losses on financial instruments, pension financing costs and corporate tax rates.
Under IFRS this process is proving to be highly complex, with the result that the determination of LTIP vesting levels is in danger of becoming opaque.
With more than 30 companies in the current comparator group, the Committee believes that to repeat this process annually would be an inappropriate use of time and resources.
The Committee therefore proposes to move to the use of relative TSR as the performance condition that will apply to all awards made under the new 2007 LTIP going forward.
This approach would be also used for the 2007 awards, the first to be made under the new LTIP using the comparator group of Companies.
The Committee is satisfied that a TSR target would not be materially easier to achieve than one that is based upon relative EPS.
The Committee believes that the use of relative TSR has a number of advantages.
These include: aligning the performance objectives of the Directors more closely with the interests of the shareholders: being an entirely objective measure of relative performance reflecting the practice most commonly used by other quoted companies: and reducing the complexity and cost of calculating the vesting out-turn.
Ultras larger shareholders have already been consulted regarding the intention to make this change and the feedback has been fully supportive.
38 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Retrospective amendment of targets for 2005 and 2006 awards There are two awards still pending under the old 2002-2007 LTIP, dating from 2005 and 2006, that were originally made on the assumption that vesting would be determined using Ultras relative EPS performance between the years 2005-2007 and 2006-2008 respectively.
The difficulties described above would be similar in evaluating Ultras relative EPS performance in 2008 and 2009.
Therefore the Committee also proposes to move to a relative TSR basis for these awards, comparing the Companys performance with that of the remaining comparator companies that would have been used for each award.
A list of these companies was provided in the 2005 Annual Report and can be found on the Companys website.
As with the change in approach for the 2007 LTIP awards, this change to the 2005 and 2006 awards is also subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Committee considers this change to the awards necessary and appropriate for the following reasons: the practical difficulties previously explained that are associated with the continued use of a relative EPS measure: the alteration will not involve a change to the group of companies against which Ultras performance was originally to be compared: and the use of relative TSR reflects current market practice as well as being the approach that will be adopted for all awards under the new LTIP.
Detailed structure of TSR performance condition The vesting rules under the revised 2007 LTIP scheme and for the 2005 and 2006 awards that would have been applied will remain unchanged.
Accordingly, vesting will be as follows: Ultras rank within the comparator group Percentage of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 20% and 100% TSR will be based upon a comparison of the Companys average share price plus reinvested dividends during the quarter immediately prior to commencement of the measurement period and its average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of the three year measurement period.
The resulting TSR will be compared with that achieved by a representative comparator group of companies.
The comparator group for measuring relative TSR for the awards made in 2007 is: Alba plc Renishaw plc Amstrad plc Rolls-Royce plc BAE Systems plc Rotork plc Charter plc Senior plc Chemring Group plc Smiths Group plc Chloride Group plc Spectris plc Cobham plc Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Dialight plc Telent plc Domino Printing Sciences plc TT Electronics plc Filtronic plc UMECO plc Halma plc Vitec Group plc Hampson Industries plc Volex Group plc Laird Group plc VT Group plc Meggitt plc Whatman plc Oxford Instruments plc Zetex plc Psion plc The Committee will review the comparator group annually and make such amendments as it sees fit for example, to take account of Companies which delist during the year.
In addition to the main TSR condition an underpin will apply to these awards requiring average annual growth in headline EPS of 7% over the relevant performance period.
In the event that this underpin is not met over a specific three-year LTIP measurement period, then the level of vesting will automatically fall to zero.
Headline EPS will be defined as earnings per share after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
The extent to which awards vest will be verified independently by a third party.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 39 Corporate governance Remuneration report continued Other features of 2007 LTIP It is the Committees normal policy to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 100% of salary.
However, in exceptional circumstances the Committee may make awards of up to 150% of salary.
The remaining features of the 2007 LTIP as outlined in detail last year, will remain unchanged.
All-Employee Share Plans The executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Inland Revenue approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Company.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, reintroduced during 2007, employees are entitled to save up to 1,200 per annum from net pay towards the purchase of options to buy Ultra shares after a period of either three or five years, depending upon the employees choice.
Senior Executive Share Ownership Guidelines To increase the alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders, the Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline under which all executive Directors will be encouraged to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they acquire on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding equivalent to 100% of base salary is achieved.
Pre-existing shareholdings will be taken into account.
At this time all Executive Directors are in compliance with this guideline.
Total Shareholder Return performance graphs The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Company in comparison with the FTSE 250 Index over the past five years.
The graph shows the value at the end of 2007 of 100 invested at the start of the evaluation period, in the Company and in the Index.
The Committee considers the FTSE 250 a relevant index for TSR comparison as the Company is a member of this and its index members represent a broad range of UK quoted Companies.

This graph has been prepared using a similar methodology to the FTSE 250 comparison, but is based upon the average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of 2007 compared to the average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of 2004.
This is consistent with the basis on which the LTIP vesting will be determined.

The non-executive Directors have fixed twelve-month contracts with no notice period.
There are no provisions in their contracts for compensation on early termination.
Directors pension entitlements The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme for current executive Directors.
A pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service.
With the Companys consent, executive Directors may retire from age 50.
After age 58, Company consent to early retirement is not required.
Pensions are reduced in the event of early retirement.
Death-in-service cover is a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings.
In addition, a spouses pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Director, a spouses pension of 50% of the Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5%, above which increases are at the Trustees discretion.
