Further details of the performance targets can be found on page 42.
The companys TSR performance relative to the comparator group was below the 50th percentile, which qualified for a nil release of half the allocated shares.
The company achieved absolute TSR growth of 66.9% during the performance period.
This qualified for a full release of the other half of the allocated shares and resulted in the following gains: Number of Share price when Gain shares released released pence N A P Carson 16,968 1,291.5 219,142 P N Hawker 10,747 1,291.5 138,798 D W Morgan 13,575 1,291.5 175,321 L C Pentz 11,269 1,291.5 145,539 J N Sheldrick 18,382 1,291.5 237,404 Pensions Pensions and life assurance benefits for the executive directors are provided through the companys final salary occupational pension scheme for UK employees the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS which is constituted under a separate Trust Deed.
JMEPS is an exempt approved scheme under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is a registered scheme for the purposes of the Finance Act 2004.
On 6th April 2006 the Finance Act 2004 introduced changes to the taxation of benefits payable from registered UK pension schemes.
Unless protected under transitional arrangements, retirement benefits that exceed a capital value called the Life Time Allowance will be subject to an additional tax charge.
Any such tax charge arising out of membership of JMEPS will be paid by the trustees at the point of retirement and the members benefits will be reduced accordingly.
Executive directors whose retirement benefits are valued in excess of the Life Time Allowance may withdraw from service in JMEPS and receive instead a supplemental payment of 25% of basic salary each year, which is taxable.
Messrs Carson and Hawker withdrew from JMEPS and ceased paying member contributions on 31st March 2006.
No pensionable service in JMEPS has been accrued by either director since that date.
The increase in accrued pension in the tables below is attributable to the increase in basic salary.
The Finance Act 2004 also enables authorised schemes to remove the restriction imposed by the earnings cap under the Finance Act No.
As a result, the accrued pensions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick for service from 6th April 2006 are calculated by reference to normal JMEPS rules and actual basic salary.
Accrued pensions in respect of service prior to that date remain restricted by reference to the earnings cap see note 6 below.
From 1st April 2007, member contributions paid by executive directors to JMEPS will increase from 4% to 5% of pensionable pay i. e. basic salary.
There will be further increases to 6% and 7% on 1st April 2008 and 1st April 2009 respectively.
Disclosure of directors pension benefits has been made under the requirements of the United Kingdom Listing Authority Listing Rules and in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The information below sets out the disclosures under the two sets of requirements.

This general rate will increase to 5% on 1st April 2007, with further increases to 6% and 7% on 1st April 2008 and 1st April 2009 respectively.
2 The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
3 The entitlement shown under Total accrued pension at 31st March 2007 is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to 31st March 2007, although pensionable service for Messrs Carson and Hawker ceased on 31st March 2006.
The pension would, however, be subject to an actuarial reduction of 0.3% per month for each month that retirement precedes age 60.
4 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note 11.
No allowance has been made in the transfer values for any discretionary benefits that have been or may be awarded under JMEPS.
The transfer values in the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 have been calculated at the start and the end of the year and, therefore, also take account of market movements.
5 Mr Carson and Dr Hawker ceased to accrue pensionable service in JMEPS with effect from 31st March 2006.
A cash payment in lieu of pension equal to 25% of basic salary has been made.
This is taxable under the PAYE system and is included in the emoluments table on page 43.
6 The JMEPS benefits and contributions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick in respect of pensionable service up to 5th April 2006 are restricted by reference to the earnings cap imposed by the Finance Act No.
Between 1st April 2000 and 31st March 2006, contributions were paid to Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS to provide retirement and death benefits in relation to basic salary in excess of the earnings cap.
FURBS were not exempt approved under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and so payments were also made to meet the tax liabilities in respect of these contributions.
No FURBS payments have been made after 31st March 2006.
Benefits and contributions in respect of service from 6th April 2006 have been provided by JMEPS in accordance with the normal scheme rules.
7 Mr Pentz is a US citizen but became a member of JMEPS on 1st January 2006.
Prior to that he was a member of the Johnson Matthey Inc.
Salaried Employees Pension Plan a non-contributory defined benefit arrangement and a US savings plan 401k.
He also has benefits in a Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
The pension values reported above are the aggregate for his separate membership of the UK and US pension schemes and the Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
US entitlements have been converted to sterling by reference to exchange rates on 31st March 2006 and 31st March 2007.
Mr Pentzs US pension was fixed on 31st December 2005.
The sterling equivalent of it has fallen over the year as a result of exchange rate movements and this reduction is reflected in the Increase in accrued pension during the year.
The Transfer value of increase is the full value of the increase in his UK pension.
