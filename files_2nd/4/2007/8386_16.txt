Mr Hare was appointed as a director of the Company on 21 July 2006 and therefore his emoluments for 2007 relate to the period from 21 July 2006 to 31 March 2007.
The other payments figure of 50,000 paid to Mr Hare relates to a one-off payment on joining the Company to cover transitional costs and relocation.
In addition to the annual cash bonus amount for the year, Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare will be awarded 648,294 and 269,252 respectively in the form of shares under the TBOP in respect of the bonus due to them for 2006 07.
The TBOP awards will not be made until 1 June 2007 and therefore the number of shares to which Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare will be entitled will not be known until that date.
Under the TBOP 50% of the shares under award will, subject to continued employment, be released after the first anniversary of the date of grant with the other 50% being released after the second anniversary.

These amounts are included in the above emoluments table.
These purchases are normally made on a quarterly basis or in the case of Mr Farmer and Mr Macfarlane a pro rata amount was purchased for them for the period since the last quarter end to 3 August 2006.
During the year the following purchases were made for non-executive directors: Mr Farmer 783 shares, Mr Green 2,317 shares, Mr Guez 2,600 shares, Mr Macfarlane 589 shares and Mr Parker 1,639 shares.
Each non-executive director has committed to retain these shares for the period of their directorship.
Mr Parker was appointed to the Board of directors on 24 May 2006 and therefore his fees for 2007 relate to the period from 24 May 2006 to 31 March 2007.
Mr Farmer and Mr Macfarlane retired as directors of the Company on 3 August 2006 and therefore their remuneration relates to the period 1 April 2006 to 3 August 2006.
Mr Hennah resigned as a director of the Company on 16 June 2006 and therefore his emoluments relate to the period from 1 April 2006 to 16 June 2006.
No compensation was paid to Mr Hennah on termination.
However, as disclosed in the 2006 Remuneration report the Committee exercised its discretion and agreed to make a bonus of 75,000 to Mr Hennah in June 2007 subject to the successful completion of personal objectives during the period of his 2006 07 employment.

As a consequence of the 2006 Rights issue and Share consolidation the above options and awards have, in accordance with the rules of the respective schemes, been adjusted.
For the Rights issue adjustment effective 15 June 2006 the number of shares comprised in each option award was multiplied by a factor of 1.07058: option exercise prices were multiplied by a factor of 0.93406: and fractions of ordinary shares were disregarded.
For the Share consolidation adjustment effective 7 August 2006 the number of shares comprised in each option award was divided by 10: option exercise prices were multiplied by 10: and fractions of ordinary shares were disregarded.
No options were exercised by or shares released under any share schemes to directors during the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2007, except the release of 2,000,000 shares under the restricted share award granted to Mr Henriksson which vested on 25 May 2006.
There have been no changes in the interests of directors over share options or awards between 31 March 2007 and 23 May 2007.
The details of the share schemes, including performance conditions which apply if any, are set out in the following notes.
The exercise of the option and release of the restricted shares granted to Mr Henriksson is contingent on continued employment until the relevant date or, at the discretion of the Committee, leaving in certain compassionate circumstances.
The restricted shares must be retained until the second anniversary of their vesting except as necessary to meet tax liabilities.
Like the awards they replaced at his former employer, the option and restricted shares are not subject to performance conditions.
Under the terms on which the restricted share award was made, the first two million shares were expressed to vest on 21 November 2005, subject to an obligation to retain the shares except any necessary sale to meet tax liabilities until 20 November 2007.
Following a delay in effecting the vesting and a subsequent dealing prohibition which prevented the vesting of these shares, the award vested on 25 May 2006 but remains subject to the original retention obligation stated above and the shares were delivered to him on 9 June 2006.
The market price of an Invensys plc share on the date of grant of 1 June 2004 was 149.45p adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation and the price on the vesting date of 25 May 2006 was 200.82p adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation.
Also under the terms on which the restricted share award was made, the second tranche was expressed to vest on 21 May 2007: as the Company was prohibited from satisfying the award on that date it is anticipated that the award will vest on 24 May 2007 and Mr Henriksson will remain subject to an obligation to retain the shares except any necessary sale to meet tax liabilities until 20 May 2009.
The executive share option granted to Mr Hennah on 4 December 2002 was granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme.
This option would normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant provided that the relevant performance condition was met.
The performance condition which applied was TSR calculated as the percentage variance in the price of shares and the value of reinvested net dividend payments over the performance period compared to that of a group of comparator companies Peer Group comprising the FTSE100 Index on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.
The performance period was the period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant, 4 December 2002.
Mr Hennahs option lapsed with effect from cessation of employment on 16 June 2006.
The Sharesave options were granted under the Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
These options are not subject to a performance condition as this is an all-employee share scheme governed by specific tax legislation.
The LTIP awards granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period.
For awards granted prior to 2005 the retention period was two years: for awards made on or after 22 July 2005 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with release of the other 50% being deferred for one year.
The following performance requirements apply: TSR test: TSR ranked against a Peer Group, selected at the discretion of the Committee with no re-testing opportunities.
TSR must rank at the median position when the Peer Group is ranked in descending order of TSR in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be available subject to the retention period, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved.
Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
If at least median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse.
The Peer Groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: awards granted on 20 June 2003 and 24 June 2004: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant: and awards granted on 22 July 2005, 1 June 2006 and 11 August 2006: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test: a awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness: b for awards granted on 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: i achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets: and ii efficient management of legacy liability items: and c for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met i relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company and ii efficient management of legacy liability items.
The mid-market price of an ordinary share on 1 June 2006 and 11 August 2006, the date of grant of the LTIP awards granted to Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare during the year respectively, was 217.17p adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation and 166.75p.
The awards were granted on the basis of 2 x salary at the date of grant divided by an average of the Invensys plc mid-market share price for the four business days preceeding the date of grant, being 208.14p adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation and 173.31p respectively.
As reported last year, the LTIP award granted to Mr Haythornthwaite on 20 June 2003, who retired from the Board of directors on 21 July 2005, did not lapse on cessation of employment but was preserved pro rata, and was subject to performance requirements measured over the entire three year performance period.
The performance condition attaching to the LTIP award granted on 20 June 2003 was not met and accordingly these awards lapsed on 20 June 2006.
The TBOP award was granted to Mr Henriksson on 1 June 2006 in respect of his 2005 06 bonus based on an average share price over the four days prior to the date of grant of 208.41p adjusted for the Rights issue and Share consolidation and 50% of the shares will, subject to continued employment, be released after the first anniversary of the date of grant with the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.
Mr Henriksson and Mr Hare will also be granted TBOP awards of 648,294 and 269,252 respectively in the form of shares under the TBOP on 1 June 2007.
These awards will be granted in respect of Mr Henrikssons and Mr Hares 2006 07 bonus.
