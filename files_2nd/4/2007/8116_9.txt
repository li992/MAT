He will remain in the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive officer for a period of not less than two years and it is expected that he will subsequently transition to the Chairman role.
The award incentivises performance over a period of three years and if he leaves the Company other than as a good leaver at any time before the third anniversary, the award will lapse.
Additional provisions manage the transition to the Chairman role within the award period.
A move to the sole role of Chairman within two years would result in a pro rated award for the proportion of the three-year period served in the executive role.
Additional shares will accrue representing the value of dividends paid during the performance period on the number of shares that ultimately vest.
Good leaver provisions would result in a scaled award pro rata for time and performance.
In the event of a change of control of Inmarsat, the award would be reduced taking account of time and performance against the original share price targets.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Senior Independent, Non-Executive Director who is also the Deputy Chairman consulted carefully with major shareholders in considering the structure of this award, and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the arrangement provides for competitive levels of reward for Mr Sukawaty but only in circumstances where substantial additional value is created for all shareholders.
The Inmarsat Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust resident in Guernsey purchased 1 million shares on 26 November 2007 to hold against the satisfaction of the award.
This has been funded through a loan from Inmarsat plc to the Trust.
Mr Sukawaty will continue to participate in the other executive share plans the BSP and PSP and the level of the special one-off award was determined after deciding that his ongoing participation in those other share plans would continue.
