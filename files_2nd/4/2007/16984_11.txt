Directors have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The figures allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap.
Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted formerly known as unapproved pension from the Group.
Payment of actual transfer values from the defined benefit scheme are currently reduced below 100% of their value.
The figures above do not reflect this reduction.
