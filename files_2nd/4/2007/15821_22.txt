based on applying the estimated weighted average cost of capital Tomkins Annual Report 2007 65 Remuneration Committee report continued The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan the PSP is a long-term incentive plan.
The purpose of the PSP is two-fold.
First, to provide a share-based long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives that more closely aligns the interests of executives with shareholders.
Secondly, the PSP is in substitution of the Companys legal obligation to the Chief Executive to provide annual grants of options, which had previously been satisfied by the Executive Share Option Scheme that lapsed in May 2005.
The Remuneration Committee considered the alternatives and, with the agreement of the Chief Executive and the assistance of PA Consulting Group, devised a plan that achieves those aims.
The PSP will provide rewards in future years only if shareholders have seen value created over the preceding three years.
The Remuneration Committee and Board believe that this creates a better alignment between executive reward and the creation of shareholder value than a standard executive share option scheme.
The PSP has four key features: i the performance baseline is established which is equal to the cost of equity and if the total shareholder return comprising dividends and increase in the share price over three years does not exceed the cost of equity over the same three-year period, no award of shares will be made: ii the award of shares will be proportional to the degree of performance over the baseline: iii there is a cap on the quantum of share awards: and iv subject to performance, awards will be made at the end of each three-year performance period.

ESOS 3 was an HM Revenue & Customs-approved scheme.
ESOS 4 was not approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
The options under both schemes mature after three years.
All outstanding ESOS 4 options were granted to participants within the limit of four times their annual earnings.
The performance condition for all outstanding options under ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 required that the growth in Tomkins earnings per share must exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index by an average of 2% per annum over a three-year period before an option can be exercised, which was in accordance with contemporary practice when the schemes were introduced in 1995.
The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No.

The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme SMS Awards which had been made under a now expired scheme known as The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan and which had vested, were eligible for matching awards for the same number of shares under the SMS.
Such awards could be for up to two conditional share matching awards vesting a further two years and four years respectively after the end of the original restricted period.
The final grant of SMS awards vested during the year and the SMS has therefore now expired.
With shareholder approval, this share scheme was introduced in 1996 with no performance conditions attached and, accordingly, it did not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.

The options have all vested and will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
Ongoing option This is an option specically and solely granted to James Nicol on 11 February 2002 as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 1,522,842 shares at 197p per share, which became exercisable on 18 February 2005 provided the rate of increase of earnings per share over any three-year period was equal to or greater than the rate of increase of the Retail Prices Index plus 9%.
This performance condition was met and the option has been exercised in respect of 972,842 shares.
The option will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company, the Remuneration Committee may adjust the number of shares in either the Tomkins Premium Priced Option or the Ongoing Option as it reasonably deems appropriate to take account of the variation.
