44% of the Enhancement Shares would vest if EPS growth was RPI 9%, and 100% would vest if EPS growth was RPI 15%.
As the EPS growth achieved was RPI 147% over the period, full vesting of the Enhancement Shares occurred.
2 Where permitted by Finance legislation, awards of Bonus Shares under the BSP are granted as forfeitable shares, which would be forfeited in the event that an executive director leaves service before the shares are released.
As a result of the share consolidation following the demerger of Mondi, a portion of any forfeitable Bonus Shares lapsed as indicated above details of the share consolidation were disclosed in the demerger prospectus.

Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2007 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 72 and 73.
The market price of the shares at the date of award was 24.63.
2 T he performance period applicable to each award is three years.
The performance period relating to the two LTIP awards in 2004 which were granted on 25 March 2004 and 26 April 2004 ended on 31 December 2006.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Companys ROCE in the medium term.
Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.
The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period.
The entry level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long-term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects e. g. translation windfalls, capital in progress to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return, relevant changes in the composition of the Group e. g. significant acquisitions and disposals and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target i. e. the target on existing and new capital for the performance period for the 2004 LTIP was 14.4% and the upper blended target 15.99%.
The ROCE achieved was 17.5% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%.
On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three-year performance period of 155%, which generated a nil vesting in terms of the 2004 Comparator Group.
The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore 50%.
