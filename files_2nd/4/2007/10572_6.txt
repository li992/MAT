The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information that is, information needed by the Companys auditors in connection with preparing their report of which the Companys auditors are not aware.

This report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the Company to be held on 22 April 2008.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee the committee during 2007 were Gill Barr chair, Bernard Asher, Jon Walden and Geraldine Gallacher, who joined on her appointment to the Board on 16 August 2007.
All members are independent nonexecutive directors.
The committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the executive directors, including the executive chairman.
It sets the salaries and remuneration packages for the executive directors and monitors the structure and level of remuneration for other senior executives.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the Companys website and on request from the company secretary.
During the year the committee consulted the chief executive, the chairman and the finance director, but in each case not in relation to their own remuneration.
The committee did not receive significant assistance from external consultants during the year.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The committee seeks to develop remuneration packages which satisfy the following principles: to attract, retain and motivate the best possible person for each position to be perceived as simple and fair and, therefore, valued by participants to ensure that the fixed element of remuneration salary, pension and other benefits is determined in line with market rates and that a significant proportion of the total remuneration package is determined by the Companys performance to recognise the importance of rewarding over-performance but not under-performance in both the short and long-term to reward directors fairly for their contributions whilst remaining within the range of benefits offered by similar companies in the sector to align the interests of executives with those of the shareholders.
During 2007 the committee reviewed the executive directors remuneration structure, which has been in place since 2005, to ensure that it continued to reflect the principles established as outlined above.
The committee considered that the total remuneration packages and specifically the current annual cash bonus potential for executive directors of 75% of base salary had fallen behind that of its peers and that the annual cash bonus element should therefore be increased to a maximum bonus of 100% of base salary from 2008, whilst retaining the existing principle of setting challenging profit-related targets for the financial year.
The committee considers that these short term rewards, together with the existing fixed element of remuneration and the existing long-term incentive arrangements will provide a balanced mix of long-term and short-term rewards to ensure that executives focus on sustained performance rather than just short-term performance, whilst ensuring an appropriate combination of fixed and performance-related remuneration.
Base salary The base salary of individual executive directors is determined by the committee prior to the beginning of each year and, if appropriate, in the event of a change in an individuals position or responsibilities.
A formal benchmarking exercise of executive directors remuneration is carried out periodically on behalf of the committee to ensure that the committee remains aware of relevant market data.
Whilst the committee has no wish to chase the median, it is also aware of the importance of maintaining competitive levels of fixed remuneration to retain key individuals.
In setting salaries for the executive directors for 2007, the committee took into account the need to ensure that the level of fixed remuneration remained competitive in order to retain and motivate key individuals.
The committee considers that the increases in salaries for 2007, when taken with relatively low pension contributions and other benefits, achieved this objective in line with the principles outlined above.
qxd 28 2 08 20:48 Page 35 Directors remuneration report Other benefits The executive directors receive certain other benefits, principally a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus At the end of each financial year the committee establishes the targets to be met for the executive directors to earn a cash bonus in respect of the following year.
For the 2007 financial year, the performance criteria were Group profit-based targets, taking into account the likely outturn profit for the 2006 financial year and growth expectations based on the Groups budget for 2007.
The maximum bonus represented 75% per cent of base salary and this was achieved.
As noted above, for the 2008 financial year, the committee has decided to increase the bonus potential for executive directors from 75% of base salary to 100% of base salary.
The bonus will continue to be based on a range of challenging profit-based targets set by reference to the Group budget.
The maximum bonus has been similarly increased for other senior executives, with performance criteria aligned primarily to the performance of the divisions over which they have a direct management influence.
Long-term incentives The Groups long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives is the Morgan Sindall Executive Remuneration Plan 2005 the 2005 Plan.
The 2005 Plan was approved by shareholders in April 2005 and gives the Company the ability to offer senior executives performance shares and or share options by way of long-term incentive.
The committee considers that the flexibility to grant both types of award provides a suitable balance of performance-related incentives with options rewarding share price growth, performance shares encouraging executive retention and both types of incentive rewarding sustained growth in earnings.
A summary of the 2005 Plan is set out below.
Award levels In normal circumstances the maximum annual award, which is subject to the achievement of testing performance targets, will be performance shares worth 75% of base salary 100% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
For the grant of awards made in 2007, in accordance with the Plan rules, executives were given the choice at the time of grant of receiving their awards either in the form of performance shares or by electing to receive share options to replace some or all of their performance shares at a rate of 4 share options for every 1 performance share.
It is anticipated that future awards will give executives a similar choice, with the awards to be granted in 2008 being offered on the same ratio.
Performance conditions The committee believes that long-term incentives should be structured so as to incentivise growth in the Groups earnings by use of a normalised earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the committees opinion, an EPS performance condition will provide a clear linkage between performance and reward for senior executives and will also only reward executives for significant improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group, which should be reflected over time in enhanced shareholder value.
The vesting of share options and performance shares awarded will be determined by the Groups EPS performance against the Retail Prices Index RPI over a single three year period with no opportunity to re-test performance.
The committee has determined that the vesting schedule for performance shares and share options should be as follows for the awards to be made in 2008, based on a three year performance period to 31 December 2010.
Average annual EPS performance in excess of RPI Performance shares Share options Vesting percentage Less than 4% pa Less than 5% pa 0% 4% pa 5% pa 25% 10% pa 10% pa 100% Between 4% and 10% pa Between 5% and 10% pa Pro rata on a straight-line basis Performance shares and options in respect of 495,450 shares, representing 1% of the issued share capital of the Company, were granted in total to employees under share plans of the Company during 2007.
These will be settled primarily by shares purchased in the market and held in the Morgan Sindall Employee Benefit Trust.
Any use by the Company of newly issued shares will be within the constraints of the Association of British Insurers compliant dilution limits contained in its scheme rules.
Pension arrangements The Company makes contributions equivalent to 10% of base salary, in the case of Paul Smith and David Mulligan, to The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefit Plan and, in the case of the other executive directors, to their individual personal pension plans.

This is considered by the committee to be the most suitable comparable broad index against which the Companys performance should be measured for this purpose.
1000 900 800 700 Cumulative TSR for the five years to 600 31 December 2007 based on original notional value of 100 500 400 Morgan Sindall 300 200 FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts 100 0 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Service contracts It is the Companys policy that executive directors service contracts should be terminable on one years notice.
In circumstances of termination by notice except in cases of removal for misconduct, compensation will be determined by the committee having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.
The committees guidelines will be to determine an equitable compensation package while avoiding rewarding poor performance and having regard to the departing directors obligations to mitigate his loss.
In ordinary circumstances, base salary and employer pension contributions for the full period of notice of one year would be paid together with accrued bonus entitlements and shares or share options granted under long-term incentive schemes where the relevant performance criteria had been satisfied.
Other employee benefits would also be maintained for the notice period subject to the rules of the appropriate Group scheme.
