74574 PRE 1 11 12 07 21:31 Page 25 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This remuneration report sets out the group's policy and structure for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors' remuneration packages and service contracts.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting on January 30 2008.
The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is chaired by JC Botts.
Its other members are The Viscount Rothermere and CJF Sinclair.
All members of the committee are non-executive directors of the company.
The Viscount Rothermere and CJF Sinclair are also directors of Daily Mail and General Trust plc but have no personal financial interests in the company other than as shareholders, and no day-today involvement in running the business.
The executive chairman normally attends meetings of the remuneration committee, but is not present at any discussion concerning his own remuneration.
For the year under review, the committee also sought advice and information from the company's managing director and finance director.
The committee's terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional external advice on any matter, at the company's expense, although none did so in 2007.
The group itself can take external advice and information from many sources in preparing proposals for the remuneration committee, but no material assistance from a single source was received in relation to remuneration decisions for 2007.
Remuneration policy The group believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.
The two consistent objectives in its remuneration policy since the companys inception in 1969 have been the maximization of earnings per share and the creation of shareholder value.
The first objective is achieved through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors and key managers to the profits and growth in profits of the group or relevant parts of the group.
This scheme is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling.
To support the implementation of the policy of profit sharing, the group is divided into a number of profit centres.
The manager of each profit centre is paid a profit share related to the profit centres profits and profit growth.
Each profit centre is part of a larger business group.
Each business group manager has an incentive based on the business groups profits and profit growth.
Profit sharing encourages directors and managers to grow their businesses, to launch new ventures and to search for acquisitions that would fit well with their businesses.
All executives on profit shares are aware that if profits rise, so does their pay.
Similarly if profits fall, so do their profit shares.
The profit shares of executive directors and senior managers make up much of their total pay.
For example, of the total remuneration of the 13 executive directors who served in the year, 86% was derived from profit shares.
The creation of shareholder value is also encouraged through an executive share option scheme and, from October 2003, the Capital Appreciation Plan CAP.
The current executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders in January 1996.
The performance criteria under which options granted under this scheme may be exercised are set out on page 27.
This scheme expired and closed in 2006, but no share options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options previously granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
The CAP was approved by shareholders in February 2005, and is a highly geared performance-based share option scheme which not only directly rewards growth in profits of each executive's businesses but also links more robustly equity reward with the delivery of economic shareholder value.
The CAP profit target was achieved this year, a year ahead of expectations.
A more detailed explanation of the CAP is given on page 27.
The directors believe that these profit sharing and share option arrangements are responsible for much of the companys success since 1969.
These arrangements serve shareholders by aligning the interests of the directors and managers with those of shareholders and are considered an important driver of the company's growth strategy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board.
Remuneration structure Executive directors It is the group's policy to construct executive remuneration packages such that a significant part of a director's compensation is based on the growth in the group's profits contributed by that director.
The details of the remuneration packages of individual directors are set out below.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salary and benefits are generally not the most significant part of a director's overall compensation package.
Each executive director receives a salary which is reviewed annually by the committee.
Certain non-cash benefits are also provided including private health care, and life assurance through the membership of one of the pension schemes.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 25 74574 PRE 1 11 12 07 21:31 Page 26 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration structure continued Pension schemes Each UK-based director is entitled to participate in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme, closed to new directors, the Euromoney Pension Plan a money purchase plan or their own private pension scheme.
Directors based overseas are entitled to participate in the pension scheme arrangements applicable to the country where they work.
Currently, NF Osborn, CR Brown, RT Lamont, D Alfano, G Mueller and MJ Carroll participate in the group's US 401 k plan.
Details of pension scheme contributions can be found on page 31 of this report.
There are no other post-retirement benefits.
Profit share scheme The group believes in aligning the economic interests of management with those of shareholders and achieves this through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of each executive director to the profits and growth in profits of the businesses that the executive director manages.
The executive directors who manage business divisions are set profit thresholds for the businesses for which they are responsible.
The profit thresholds are set at the time the director takes on responsibility for the businesses concerned, usually based on the profits of the previous 12 months, and are adjusted if such responsibilities change.
The normal profit share arrangement pays 1% of profits from zero up to a threshold and then 5% of profits achieved in excess of this threshold.
Some of the directors have schemes which have been in place for a number of years and pay profit shares at slightly higher rates or which are subject to additional thresholds.
The profit shares of the chairman and managing director are based on an adjusted pre-tax post-minority profits of the group, thereby matching their profit share with the pre-tax return the group generates for its shareholders.
The chairman is entitled to 5.62% 2006: 6.49% of an adjusted pre-tax profit.
The managing director is entitled to 3.32% 2006: 3.84% of an adjusted pre-tax profit up to a threshold of 30,450,138 and an additional 1.25% 2006: 1.44% of adjusted pre-tax profits in excess of this threshold.
The finance director receives a profit share linked to a pre-tax adjusted earnings per share of the group EPS.
A fixed sum is payable for every percentage point the EPS is above 11.00p and an additional fixed sum is payable for every percentage point that EPS is above 20.00p.
CHC Fordham, in addition to his profit share, has a second incentive linked to the performance of acquisitions.
JL Wilkinson, who is responsible for all the group's marketing activities, receives an incentive based on the growth in the group's subscription and delegate revenues.
All of the profit share schemes are completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling and are designed to be the most significant part of the executive director's remuneration package.
Each director's profit share scheme is subject to remuneration committee approval, and can be revised at any time if the director's responsibilities are changed.
The table below shows the 2007 percentage split of the fixed and variable elements of each director's remuneration package.

Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 250 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The executive directors who are currently participating in this scheme are PM Fallon, PR Ensor, NF Osborn, CR Jones, SM Brady and CHC Fordham, details of which can be found on pages 32 and 33 of this report.
Share option schemes The directors consider that share option schemes are an important part of overall compensation and align the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders.
Capital Appreciation Plan CAP The CAP was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005 and replaced the 1996 executive share option scheme.
Each CAP award comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
In accordance with the terms of CAP, no consideration was paid for the grant of the awards.
The awards vest in three equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards become exercisable on satisfaction of a primary performance condition and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The two future tranches of awards become exercisable one year and two years, respectively, following the financial year in which the primary performance target was achieved.
The second and third tranches only vest on satisfaction of the primary and a secondary performance condition.
The scheme is potentially available to all employees.
The primary performance condition, broadly, requires that the company achieve pre-tax profits before goodwill amortisation or impairment, exceptional items and before the cost of the CAP of 57 million by no later than the financial year ending September 30 2008 and remain at at least this level for the future vesting periods of the following two tranches.
This target was increased from 50 million following the acquisition of Metal Bulletin.
The secondary performance condition requires that the profits of the respective participants' businesses in the subsequent two vesting periods remain at at least 75% of that achieved in the year the primary performance condition was met.
The CAP profit target was achieved in financial year 2007 and the option pool of a maximum of 7.5 million shares will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the primary performance condition, subject to conditions that no individual may have an option over more than 10% of the option pool.
One third of the awards will vest immediately, with the other two thirds vesting in equal tranches in the following two years, but only if the primary and secondary performance conditions are met.
Otherwise vesting is deferred until both the profit target of 57 million achieved in 2007 is achieved again, and the profits of the individual participants businesses are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
Thus the CAP is designed so that profit growth must be sustained if awards are to vest in full.
Accordingly, and subject as described above, the award to each director comprises an option to subscribe for up to 750,000 shares.
The actual value of the CAP award to each director will depend on the relative profit contribution of his her businesses to the achievement of the performance condition.
The provisional number of options anticipated to be received by the directors for the first tranche is given in the directors share option table on pages 32 and 33.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to calculate its value are set out in note 23.
1996 executive share option scheme All executive directors have options from a previous executive share option scheme approved by shareholders in 1996 in which potentially all employees could receive options.
This scheme expired in 2006 and no share options have been issued under this scheme since February 2004 although options granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
Options were issued to a selection of individual employees, including directors, on a merit basis.
These options are exercisable at least three years after their grant and are subject to certain performance conditions.
For options that expired on February 7 2007, and those expiring on January 29 2009, February 11 2009, June 25 2009 and January 5 2010 the performance test set by the remuneration committee requires the growth in the company's earnings per share for the three consecutive financial years commencing from the year of grant to exceed the growth in the retail prices index by an average of 4% a year.
For the options expiring on June 25 2009 only, there is an additional performance condition which requires that Internet Securities, Inc. must have achieved an operating profit for three consecutive months and a cumulative operating profit over a period of six months.
For all other options expiring after 2005, the performance test set by the remuneration committee requires that the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the company exceeds that of the average TSR for the FTSE 250 index for the same period.
For the performance condition to be satisfied, the TSR of the company must exceed that of the FTSE 250 on a cumulative basis, measured from the date of grant of the option, in any four out of six consecutive months starting 30 months after the option grant date.

There are no performance conditions attached to these options.
Their options, all of which are fully vested and exercisable, are set out on page 34.
The market price at the date of exercise is determined by an independent financial valuation of Internet Securities, Inc.
Details of directors' share options can be found on pages 32 to 34.
Put options G Mueller has a put option whereby he is able to sell his 5% holding of shares in Internet Securities, Inc. ISI, a subsidiary of the group, to Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC at a fair market value as determined by an independent external valuation of the company.
G Mueller retains the rights granted under this put option should his employment contract terminate.
In addition G Mueller has an IPO registration right over ISI that he may exercise every six months subject to the agreement of the other shareholders.
If an agreement cannot be reached the company has the right to purchase his shares at a fair market value as determined by the average valuation from three investment banks.
If G Mueller has not exercised his option by 2011 the company has the right to purchase his shares at a pre-determined premium to an independent external valuation of the company.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the chairman and executive board with the aid of external professional advice if necessary.
Non-executive directors receive a fee and are re-imbursed for expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provisions, share options or other forms of benefits apart from Sir Patrick Sergeant, who receives an expense allowance, and JC Botts who is a participant in the Internet Securities, Inc. option scheme.

This index has been presented as it comprises the comparator group for the performance conditions attached to the share option scheme referred to above.
The TSR calculations assume the re-investment of dividends.

All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of each director's pension benefits.
They do not represent a sum paid or payable to individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The normal retirement age for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme is 62 years.
PM Fallon's pension benefits relate to a deferred pension in the Mail Newspapers Pension Scheme for pensionable service between April 1 1978 and April 1 1986.
No further contributions have been made to this scheme by the group or PM Fallon.
CR Jones' options were exercised on February 1 2007 when the market price per share was 5.75 resulting in a gain of 18,586.
He retained 4,224 of the shares.
SM Brady's options were exercised on February 15 2007 when the market price per share was 5.945 resulting in a gain of 7,701.
Options granted relate to those that are likely to be issued under the first tranche of the CAP which vest on February 14 2008, three months following the announcement of the company's results.
The number of options granted to each director is provisional and will primarily require adjustment for the allocation of options belonging to future leavers and adjustments to profits of the respective directors' individual businesses from true-up adjustments during the period to December 31 2007 as required by the remuneration committee.
As such the actual number of options granted will vary from that disclosed.
