the role of the Committee is to determine on behalf of the Board, the salary and benefits received by the Chairman and the executive Directors and for overseeing the remuneration of other Senior executives.
the Committees terms of Reference are set out on the Companys website www.
Its key responsibilities are: to determine the remuneration policy for executive Directors and such other members of the executive management as it is designated to consider: to design specific remuneration packages which include salaries, bonuses, equity incentives, pension rights and benefits: to review the executive Directors service contracts: to ensure that failure is not rewarded and that steps are always taken to mitigate loss on termination, within contractual obligations: to review remuneration trends across the Group: and to approve the terms of and recommend grants under the Groups incentive plans.

During the year the Committee met four times and all members of the Committee attended each meeting.
the Committee also takes independent professional advice, on an ad hoc basis, as required.
the Committee reviews its own performance annually and considers where improvements can be made.
During the year the Committee conducted its annual review of remuneration to ensure that the overall remuneration structure continues to promote the Companys business strategy.
the Committee also reviewed the share scheme performance criteria to ensure its continued appropriateness prior to the grant of Awards under the Long term Incentive plans the LtIp and options under the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS.
For the LtIp Awards made in 2007 the Committee decided that the threshold at which 30% of the Award vests should be increased requiring 5% real annual compound growth in epS over the three year performance period.
In January 2006, the Remuneration Committee appointed  LLp pwC, a leading consultancy firm with substantial expertise in executive remuneration to assist the Committee in refining its strategy on rewarding and compensating its Senior executives and in so doing have regard to market comparability and the remuneration policies of the Groups peers and competitors.
pwC advised the Committee during the 2007 financial year particularly in relation to the continued implementation of the Groups remuneration strategy and the provision of relevant market information.
pwC also provides the Company with taxation advice and consultancy services.
POLICy ON REMUNERATION OF ExECUTIVE DIRECTORS the Companys policy for 2007 and subsequent years is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the executive Directors for the contribution they make to the business and are competitive enough to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right calibre.
the policy is designed to incentivise the Directors to meet the Companys financial and strategic objectives such that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related.
the Companys financial and strategic objectives are set out in the Business Review on pages 13 to 15. the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to consider corporate performance of environmental, social and governance issues when determining the overall reward for the executive Directors.
the bar chart on page 53 explains the relevant importance of the elements of the remuneration package that are performancerelated and those that are not.

LtIp and DABS awards are included at their face value.
In reviewing executive Directors salaries due consideration is given to the levels of increase granted to other employees within the Group and the Committee reviews and notes the total individual remuneration packages of each of the other Senior executives.
the Committee also considers the information from the Companys comparator group, which comprises 24 companies of broadly similar market capitalisation to the Companys excluding finance and real estate companies and 20 companies having broadly similar levels of turnover.
Basic salaries are reviewed annually or when a change of responsibility occurs.
the Committee considers that the targets set for the different elements of performance related remuneration including the share option schemes are appropriate and demanding in the context of the Companys trading environment and the business challenges it faces.
the Committee believes that the earnings per Share epS condition is appropriate for its share incentive schemes i. e. LtIp and DABS as it requires substantial improvements in the underlying financial performance of the Company in order for the options to become exercisable.
Deloitte & touche LLp, in their capacity as Auditors, are required to review the calculations as to whether the performance targets for all relevant share schemes have been achieved before any exercise is permitted.
the main components of executive Directors remuneration are given below: BASE SALARy AND BENEFITS Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee based upon the recommendations of the Chief executive and after a review of the individuals performance, experience and market trends.
the Chief executive does not make recommendations to the Committee in respect of his own remuneration.
the Committee takes into account published remuneration information on comparable companies and salary policy within the rest of the Group.
Benefits comprise a company car, medical and permanent health insurance.
the value of benefits is not pensionable.

Mr. C. J. Davies predetermined performance targets, which relate to profit performance of those businesses under his direct control and to the SIG Group as a whole, were achieved in full resulting in the maximum amount of 72% of base salary being payable.
Mr. M. J. Chivers predetermined performance targets, which relate to profit performance of those businesses under his direct control and to the SIG Group as a whole, were substantially achieved resulting in an amount of 67% of base salary being payable.
For the 2008 financial year the Committee has agreed that following the review carried out in 2007 the maximum bonus that can be earned should be 100% of base salary for each executive Director.
the performance targets were increased as a result of this change.
In the case of Mr. D. Williams his bonus will be based on his base salary at 1 January 2008 up to the date of his intended retirement on 30 June 2008.
In the case of Mr. C. J. Davies it has been agreed that his bonus will be based on his salary as at 1 July 2008 when he becomes Chief executive.
However, the maximum bonus will only be paid on the achievement of very stretching targets and personal objectives.
PENSION SCHEMES All executive Directors are members of the Groups contributory defined benefit pension scheme, which enables members to retire at age 60 with a maximum pension after 40 years pensionable service equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
pensionable salary is basic salary, excluding bonuses.
Final pensionable salary is the average of the highest three consecutive pensionable salaries in the last ten years before retirement.
For service up to 31 July 2002, pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum compound.
Following consultation with the active membership of the scheme certain changes were made to the contribution levels and benefits in order to limit future liabilities and, consequently, for service from 1 August 2002, pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by the lower of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail price Index.
on death before retirement, a lump sum equal to four times current salary is paid, together with a spouses pension of 50% of pensionable salary.
As part of this scheme, all executive Directors are covered by permanent health insurance.
In March 2006 the Board agreed that the rules of the Groups contributory defined benefit pension scheme should be amended to permit continued accrual in the Scheme to age 65.
All Members will be permitted to take their benefits at age 60 without abatement if they so wish.
SHARE OPTION SCHEMES LonG teRM InCentIve pLAnS LtIp All executive Directors are eligible to participate in the LtIp.
Under the LtIp participating Directors and other designated Senior Managers are granted nil cost share options up to a maximum of 70% of base salary.
In 2004 Shareholders approved the adoption of a new LtIp.
options were granted in each of the five years ended 31 December 2003 under the old plan and in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 under the new plan.
As set out on page 59 in the Directors share options table under the heading Long term Incentive plan, none of the executive Directors have awards which had not vested at 31 December 2007 under the old plan.
Awards under the LtIp are not pensionable.
Awards under both of the LtIps are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Under the Rules of the LtIp outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement and redundancy or on a change of control, on a time related, prorata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria.
If, however, the termination of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the Rules an individuals full award lapses, unless in exceptional circumstances the Committee decides otherwise.
there were no exercises of discretion by the Committee during the year.

the performance targets attaching to LtIp Awards that are still subject to performance are set out below.
In the case of the Awards made in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the performance condition is based on real in excess of RpI annual compound growth in epS as shown below.
the three year performance period for Awards starts at the beginning of the financial year in which the Award is made.
there is no facility for retesting the performance condition after the end of the three year performance period.
Real annual compound growth in Group epS over three years percentage of Award vesting threshold 3% 30% Maximum 10% 100% Between threshold and Maximum 3% 10% prorata between 30% and 100% In the case of the 2007 Award, the performance condition is based on real in excess of RpI annual compound growth in epS as shown below.
Real annual compound growth in Group epS over three years percentage of Award vesting threshold 5% 30% Maximum 10% 100% Between threshold and Maximum 5% 10% prorata between 30% and 100% For 2008 the Remuneration Committee has decided that the level of Award to be made under the LtIp will be increased to 100% of base salary for Mr. C. J. Davies as a result of his appointment as Chief executive on 1 July 2008 and 75% of base salary for the Mr. M. J. Chivers and Mr. G. W. Davies.
As a result of his intended retirement of 30 June 2008 no Award will be made to Mr. D. Williams in 2008.
For the Awards to be granted in 2008 the Committee has decided that the requirement at which 100% of the Award vests will be increased requiring 12% real annual compound growth in epS over the three year performance period.
the above performance conditions were chosen because they were believed to be challenging and not only take account of the need for long term performance and commitment but also are an important means of aligning the interests of the employees and Shareholders.
At the end of the relevant period the Remuneration Committee assesses whether the performance conditions have been satisfied.
In 2007 Awards were made under the LtIp to Mr. D. Williams with a value of 70% of his base salary and to Mr. M. J. Chivers, Mr. C. J. Davies and Mr. G. W. Davies with a value of 50% of their base salary as shown in the table on page 59.

participants including executive Directors are invited to use up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after income tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year to purchase shares in the Company.
the purchased shares must be retained for three years.
participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive up to a maximum of one additional free matching share for every share purchased, providing certain preset real in excess of RpI annual compound epS growth targets are met over a three year period.
For 2007 the performance targets for the DABS are shown below: Real annual compound growth in Group epS over three years percentage of Award vesting threshold 3% 50% Maximum 5% 100% Between threshold and Maximum 3% 5% prorata between 50% and 100% the above performance conditions were chosen because they were believed to be challenging and not only take account of the need for long term performance and commitment but also are an important means of aligning the interests of employees and Shareholders.
Awards made under the DABS are not pensionable and are set out in the table on page 59.
Under the Rules of the DABS outstanding awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement and redundancy or on a change of control, on a time related, prorata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria.
If, however, the termination of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the Rules an individuals full award lapses.

SHARE OwNERSHIP GUIDELINES to better align executive Director interests with those of Shareholders the Company has established the principle of requiring executive Directors to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of one times basic salary.
Under normal circumstances it is expected that this should be achieved within five years of 31 December 2004, or within five years of appointment, whichever is the later.
It is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Companys share schemes.
