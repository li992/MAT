Unaudited Information Compliance The Board considers that the Company has complied throughout the year with the requirements of the Combined Code in relation to Directors remuneration with the exception of the provision relating to the formation and constitution of a remuneration committee see page 15.
In determining remuneration policy, the Board has given full consideration to the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Policy The remuneration policy adopted by the Board is designed to ensure that the Directors interests are allied to the long-term growth of the Group and therefore to the interests of the shareholders as a whole.
The Group does not operate any form of bonus scheme or share option scheme since the Executive Directors salaries for the year are determined by the Board once the results for the year are known with any salary increase calculated and paid with effect from the beginning of the financial year.
