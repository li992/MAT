2 The transfer value of net increase in accrued pension represents the incremental value to the director of his service to 31 March 2007.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contribution.
3 The GN11 transfer values of accrued pension at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of Guidance Note GN11 adopted by the Board of Actuarial Standards.
4 The change in GN11 transfer value includes the effect of uctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company, such as stockmarket movements.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contributions.
5 The increase in the accrued pension excluding ination for the year ended 30 June 2007, and the GN11 transfer value of this increase, for Mr Nelson, is negative because the increase in Final Pensionable Salary over the year, used to calculate the accrued pension at 30 June 2007, has been lower than ination over the same period and he has only accrued 9 months of pension during the year.
6 The GN11 transfer value of the increase in the accrued pension for Mr Fitzgerald, is negative because his contributions for the year ended 30 June 2007 were greater than the GN11 transfer value of the increase in the accrued pension.
7 Members of the Scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither any contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above table.
