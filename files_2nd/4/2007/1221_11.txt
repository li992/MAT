Remuneration report UK reporting Remuneration committee The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Groups policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for each executive director.
This includes basic salary, annual bonus, the level and terms of conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the terms of performance conditions that apply to such benets, pension rights and any compensation payments.
Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee will make recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management.
The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the preparation of the boards annual report to shareholders on the Groups policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985, the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The committees terms of reference are published on the companys website at www.
The committee is chaired by Jeremy Scudamore and the other members are Kathleen ODonovan and Young Sohn, who was appointed in place of Peter Cawdron on 15 May 2007.
The committee met four times during 2007.
Given their diverse experience, these three independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced view and international expertise in relation to remuneration issues for the Group.
The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers generally appointed by the Executive Vice President, Human Resources in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice.
During 2007, KPMG provided general advice on remuneration and benets, Linklaters provided legal services, Deloitte and Monks both provided salary survey data, Kepler Associates provided independent verication of TSR calculations for the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, also provided advice to the committee and to the Group.
Monks is an associate of the Groups external auditor and these services were approved by the audit committee as in accordance with the procedure described in the corporate governance report.
The Chief Executive officer and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of remuneration committee meetings.
No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan for executive directors and senior managers and the Employee Equity Plan for all other employees were approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM.
These plans brought the Groups remuneration structure more closely in line with UK market norms, increased alignment between remuneration and financial performance and strengthened the retention aspect of the deferred bonus.
Cessation of option grants to executive directors other than in exceptional circumstances and the reduction from three plans to two for executive directors and senior managers, together with the move away from options to shares for all employees, reduces potential dilution and simplies remuneration arrangements.
Remuneration policy The remuneration committee, in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Groups executive directors, seeks to give full consideration to the principles set out in the Combined Code.
The committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors.
The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the high quality management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with the best interests of shareholders.
This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reect their performance and align with the objectives of the Group.
These comprise a mix of performance-related and  remuneration.
The committee believes that a directors total remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates a policy of paying base salaries which are in line with the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile.
The committee believes that this is justied, recognising that more than 50% of total potential remuneration is performance-related.
The committee obtains information about the external market from various independently published remuneration surveys and is committed to benchmarking the total remuneration package.
The nature of the Groups development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of shortterm objectives with a high level of variable remuneration.
From 2007 onwards, variable remuneration consists of two performance-related elements: annual bonus and a conditional award under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers who are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years.
The shareholdings may be built up of shares received through earlier grants under the Companys share option schemes and or the Long Term Incentive Plan and or the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, in the case of executive directors, the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group.
The various incentive schemes that comprise the remuneration packages of executive directors and senior managers are described later in this report: 38 ARM Holdings plc Deferred Annual Bonus Plan There is a strong variable element to executive directors remuneration and a bonus of up to 125% of base salary after application of a personal performance multiplier which exes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25 can be earned through the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB if all targets are met.
The personal performance multiplier depends on the achievement of pre-determined objectives which are reviewed and approved by the committee each year.
These include key strategic objectives related to each directors role and responsibilities including compliance with the Management Charter which is designed to foster employee development, understanding of the overall vision and strategy of the Group and good governance.
There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 2:1, subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition.
Deferred shares and any matching shares earned will normally be transferred three years from the date of award.
Payment of bonus for 2007 was subject to the achievement of US dollar revenue and EPS targets set by the remuneration committee, which were directly related to the Groups financial results.
The bonuses payable to executive directors in respect of performance during 2007 are shown in the table on page 46 and are in the range 37.0% to 38.6% of base salary, 50% of which was compulsorily deferred into shares.
At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum.
The deferred shares can be forfeited in the event of gross misconduct and the matching shares are subject to forfeiture for bad leavers.
For 2008, 50% of bonus is dependent on achieving a US dollar revenue target and 50% on achieving a normalised operating profit target, which the committee believes have been set at challenging but motivational levels.
These targets are directly related to the Groups financial results and encourage achievement of the Groups short-term financial goals, while the deferral and matching elements encourage a longer term view of the success of the Group.
Maximum bonus is 125% of base salary depending on the personal performance multiplier described above.
Existing option schemes The grant of options under the existing share option schemes ceased in 2006 when the DAB and the Employee Equity Plan were approved by shareholders.
The Employee Equity Plan has the facility for option grants to be made, but this will be done only in exceptional circumstances.
The existing option grants to executive directors remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
In line with practice among the Groups peers in the technology sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options under the existing schemes, except for those issued to executive directors where performance conditions based on real EPS growth apply.
Share options issued to executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions attached to them.
However, discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group do have performance conditions attached to them.
These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest after three years from grant to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on TSR rather than EPS, providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against which it competes to attract and retain high calibre employees.
The committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For executive directors, the rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executives basic salary.
Service agreements Executive directors have rolling service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one years notice.
These agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services to the Group on a full-time basis and contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, nonsolicitation of the Groups customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the Groups suppliers and employees.
In addition, each service contract contains an express obligation of condentiality in respect of the Groups trade secrets and condential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
ARM Holdings plc 39 Remuneration report UK reporting continued The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows: Director Date Warren East 29 January 2001 Tim Score 1 March 2002 Tudor Brown 3 April 1996 Mike Inglis 17 July 2002 Mike Muller 31 January 1996 Simon Segars 4 January 2005 Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion is entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors During 2007, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees and the senior independent director each received a total fee of 41,000 per annum and the other non-executive directors each received a total fee of 36,000 per annum.
These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity, and reected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Groups activities during the year, which is between 10 and 15 working days a year.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the executive directors and the term of appointment is three years.
Fees paid to non-executive directors are reviewed annually.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benets.
No element of their fees is performance-related.
Share options held by Lucio Lanza were granted prior to the Groups acquisition of Artisan.
