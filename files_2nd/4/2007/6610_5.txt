Under the terms of the PSP the number of shares actually vesting is determined following the end of the relevant three-year measurement period and is dependent on GSKs performance during that period as described on pages 74 to 76.
The performance share awards were previously granted annually in November or December prior to the start of the performance period but, since the 2006 grant, they are granted in February of the first year of the performance period.
The measurement period commences on 1st January ending after three years on 31st December.
For awards with a performance period commencing on 1st January 2005 and subsequent awards, dividends are reinvested on the performance shares awarded to Executives, throughout the performance period and up to the date of the final award.
The dividend reinvestment is calculated as of the ex-dividend date.
Under the terms of the PSP, US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
The total gain on vesting of PSP awards made by Executive Directors is 74,400 2006 1,285,677.
The PSP awards granted to Executive Directors excluding Dr Slaoui in December 2004, with the performance period starting on 1st January 2005 and ending on 31st December 2007 vested in part because of GSKs relative TSR performance placed the company above the median of the comparator group.
The awards made to other senior executives in 2004, including Dr Slaoui were dependent in part on TSR performance and in part on EPS performance.
The TSR portion vested in part and the EPS portion vested in full.
The following vesting schedules apply to awards made in 2004 and 2006.
