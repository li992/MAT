Report on Directors remuneration Opening statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The Committees role is to govern Executive Directors remuneration, and to ensure that the Companys reward strategy helps to drive business performance and shareholder value.
All the Committee members are independent Non-executive Directors, or, in the case of Peter Cawdron, was independent on his appointment as Chairman of Punch Taverns plc.
The Committee is committed to clear disclosure of Directors remuneration to shareholders: this report details the individual remuneration of Board Directors and explains the principles and policies that the Committee has applied.
The following points provide important context for the Report on Directors remuneration: x the Group has performed strongly during 2006 2007, with both profit before tax and earnings per share EPS up by 13% pre exceptional items over the previous year: x total shareholder return TSR for the five years to August 2007 has been 458% compared with 156% for the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index, and 66% for the FTSE 100: and x the Company has entered the FTSE 100 during the last financial year.
During 2007, the Committee has undertaken a review of reward strategy.
The conclusions of this review were: x that the Company should continue to apply a policy of limiting the fixed elements of remuneration base salary and pension, whilst using the performance-related elements annual bonus and long term incentive to drive performance and maintain market competitiveness: x that base salaries should be positioned in a range between lower quartile and median, but that the performance-related elements should have sufficient scope to deliver upper quartile total remuneration relative to the market, for upper quartile performance: x for upper quartile total remuneration to be achieved, this would require an increase to the annual bonus payable for outstanding Company and personal performance from 100% to 150% of base salary.
One third of bonus is to be delivered in Company shares.
There will be no matching opportunity on these shares unlike the previous scheme whereby free matching shares were provided subject to a performance condition on 25% of the bonus earned in the year: x that the maximum Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP award should remain at the existing level of 200% of base salary face value : and x that the LTIP should be linked to total shareholder return and growth in EPS, to focus on both of these important performance measures.
The Committee is submitting a resolution to shareholders for approval of the LTIP at the January 2008 AGM.
The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote to approve the Report on Directors remuneration, and to support the proposed LTIP.
On behalf of the Board Fritz Ternofsky Remuneration Committee Chairman 2 32 www.
com Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code the Code relating to remuneration matters.
The report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains the commentary of remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The Committee members are: Fritz Ternofsky Chairman Mike Foster Peter Cawdron They are all independent Non-executive Directors, or, in the case of Peter Cawdron, was independent on his appointment as Chairman of Punch Taverns plc.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and any changes to their service contracts, as well as the remuneration of other senior executives.
The Committee also governs any annual bonus plans, long term incentives and employee share plans.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
Advisers to the Committee In respect of the 2006 review, the Committee received independent remuneration advice from Halliwell Consulting Halliwell and in respect of the 2007 review, the Committee received independent remuneration advice from Hewitt Associates Hewitt.
These advisers were appointed by the Committee and are accountable to it.
Halliwell continue to provide administration services connected to the Companys Executive and all employee share plans and Hewitt provide consulting advice to the Company in respect of its Spirit pension schemes and actuarial, investment and other advice to the trustee of the two Spirit pension schemes.
The Committee does not believe that the independence of its advisers are compromised by these appointments.
The Committee also consulted with the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary and the Group Director of Human Resources.
However, no executive was permitted to participate in discussions about their personal remuneration.
The Committee met five times during the course of the year.
Remuneration policy The Committees reward policy is designed to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value.
It is based on the following principles: x that remuneration should be viewed holistically Total Reward, taking account of all reward elements: x that Total Reward should be set at a market competitive level to retain and recruit people of the required talent and experience: x that the package should be structured to allow the majority of Total Reward to be dependent on performance: x that Total Reward liabilities and costs should be monitored and controlled: and x that Total Reward should support the creation of shareholder value.
Remuneration is benchmarked against two relevant comparator groups: Comparator group 1 Comparator group 2 UK pub, restaurant and hotel sector companies UK companies of similar size and complexity examples provided below to Punch Taverns in other relevant sectors Enterprise Inns plc Marstons plc Mitchells & Butlers plc Restaurant Group plc J D Wetherspoon plc Luminar plc Whitbread plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Greene King plc 33 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 3 Report on Directors remuneration continued The table below summarises, for 2007 2008, each element of the Punch Taverns Total Reward package for Executive Directors and its key features: Component Size Market posture Purpose Delivery Other key features Base salary Varies by role and In a range from To recognise the x Cash.

The Committee has given careful consideration to the level of base salaries for Executive Directors, and the comparison of these with the market.
The increases in base salary for the 2007 2008 year were required to reflect the Committees policy of positioning base salary in a range between market lower quartile and median.
Despite these increases, the base salaries for these positions remain below the relevant market median.
The Committee also took the view that increases should be immediate rather than phased over number of years to enable the retention of key talent and to reward people appropriately against comparator companies.
com Annual bonus Policy: maximum bonus to be upper quartile 2006 2007 bonus year The table below explains the structure of annual bonus for the 2006 2007 performance year.
The maximum annual bonus available was 100% of base salary, with amount paid being split part cash 75% and part Punch Taverns plc shares 25%, with further matching shares released after three years for further information see section under Long term incentives.
The performance conditions for the Executive Directors were structured as follows: Key performance area Weighting Company financial results 60% Performance of individuals own business area or function for Chief Executive this is Company as a whole 30% Other personal contribution 10% The bonuses earned for 2006 2007 for each current Executive Director are shown in the table below: Name Position Annual bonus paid % of base salary Giles Thorley Chief Executive 335,700 74.6% Phil Dutton Finance Director Nil N A Jonathan Paveley Commercial Director 162,240 67.6% Andrew Knight Managing Director Spirit 126,240 52.6% 2007 2008 bonus year For the 2007 2008 financial year, the Committee has implemented the following changes to the annual bonus plan: x the maximum annual bonus available has increased from 100% to 150% of base salary.
This was necessary to maintain annual bonus at an upper quartile level, whilst the base salary continues to be contained in a range of lower quartile to median and pension is limited to the lower quartile: x the maximum bonus of 150% of base salary will only be payable if both individual and Company performance is outstanding: and x one third of the annual bonus will be delivered in shares that must be retained for at least two years and there will be no matching opportunity on these shares.
35 Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 3 Report on Directors remuneration continued Long term incentives Policy: maximum long term incentives should be upper quartile for upper quartile performance Punch Taverns plc LTIP Awards made during the 2006 2007 financial year under this LTIP have the following features: x performance shares: x three year vesting period: x three year performance period measured from November 2006 to November 2009 : x a relative TSR performance condition: and x maximum award size of 200% of base salary face value.
Relative TSR is measured against the following companies: Carnival plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Enterprise Inns plc Mitchells & Butlers plc Gondola Holdings plc MyTravel Group plc Greene King plc Rank Group plc Intercontinental Hotels Group plc Restaurant Group plc J D Wetherspoon plc Whitbread plc Marstons plc William Hill plc The vesting scale is as follows: Ranking in the peer group % of award that vests Upper quartile or above 100% Between median and upper quartile Straight line pro-ration Median 25% Below median 0% with no re-testing of performance Relative TSR was selected as an appropriate performance metric as it is a direct measure of shareholder value creation, relative to the shareholder value generated by other companies.
Vesting is also subject to the Committee being satisfied that the TSR achieved is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance.
The table below shows the levels of LTIP award made to the current Executive Directors during the 2006 2007 year, the fair value of those awards taking account of the performance condition and the face value at median and upper quartiles: Face value Face value % of salary at median at upper quartile Name Position awarded Number of shares Fair value performance performance Giles Thorley Chief Executive 200% 79,787 493,140 225,000 900,000 Phil Dutton Finance Director N A N A N A N A N A Jonathan Paveley Commercial Director 200% 39,007 251,091 110,000 440,000 Andrew Knight Managing Director Spirit 200% 42,553 263,007 120,000 480,000 2007 2008 financial year The Committee has proposed a new LTIP to replace the existing Plan.
The proposed LTIP will have the same maximum award size of 200% of base salary.
The proposed performance conditions are relative TSR and EPS growth, with half of each award related to each of the two metrics.
Full details of the proposed LTIP will be included in the AGM circular to shareholders.
com Punch Taverns plc Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB In addition to the LTIP, Executive Directors also participated in the DSB.
As described in the section of this report relating to annual bonus, 25% of annual bonus was delivered in shares.
Provided these shares net of tax are retained for at least three years, the individual remains in employment with Punch Taverns plc for the three years, and a performance condition is met, the gross value of the amount of bonus that was originally delivered in shares is matched one-for-one.
The performance condition is that the Companys EPS growth must be at least equal to RPI Retail Price Index inflation 5% p. a.

Of this 10%, only 5% can be issued to satisfy awards under discretionary plans that apply to executives and senior managers only.
The current position against these limits is shown below.
It should be noted that the figures below exclude 3.21% of dilution relating to options granted prior to the Companys flotation in May 2002 and therefore not subject to the ABI guidelines.
