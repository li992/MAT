Babcock International Group PLC 32 Annual report and accounts 2007 Remuneration report This report sets out: the companys remuneration policy for its Directors for the 2006 07 financial year and which it currently intends to follow for the present and subsequent financial years: details of the Directors remuneration packages and contracts.
The report will be submitted for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the company in July 2007.
Remuneration Committee Responsibility for determining and approving the remuneration packages of the Chairman, executive Directors and certain other senior group executives is delegated by the Board to a Remuneration Committee the Committee consisting solely of independent non-executive Directors of the company.
Those Directors who served on the Committee did so for the entire year under review, and were: D Shah Committee Chairman J Rennocks Sir Nigel Essenhigh J Crookenden The Committee met formally three times in the year and each committee member attended all the meetings.
Biographical details of the members of the Committee are set out on page 24.
Other than the Company Secretary who attends meetings as Secretary to the Committee, no other director or executive attends meetings unless by invitation.
Mr Campbell, Group Chairman and Mr Rogers, Chief Executive officer have attended meetings at such invitation, but neither is present when his own remuneration is under discussion.
Lord Hesketh attends some meetings of the Committee as an observer.
The Committee receives independent, market-based advice on the Chairmans, executive Directors and senior management remuneration from The Inbucon Group Limited Inbucon, remuneration consultants.
Inbucon was appointed, with the Committees approval, by the company acting through the Group Company Secretary.
Inbucon does not provide other services to group companies.
During the year, Mr Shah Committee Chairman directly commissioned Inbucon to update the full review of the Chairmans and senior executive remuneration carried out by Inbucon in the previous financial year.
Remuneration policy The companys management team has a proven track-record of successfully implementing strategy, see graph overleaf.
There is a highly competitive market for such talent.
Reecting this competition, the companys remuneration policy is based on the following principles: retaining and facilitating the recruitment of talent with such proven record: and providing a fair sharing of rewards between management, employees and shareholders.
These principles are reected in the remuneration packages adopted for the executives, which comprise a combination of basic pay, benets, annual bonus and long-term incentive programmes.
Performance graphs The first graph below left, compiled by Inbucon, shows the total shareholder return for a holding in the companys shares for the period from 31 March 2002 to 31 March 2007 relative to a holding of shares representing the FTSE All-Share Index excluding investment trusts.
This is the same index as used for this purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, being a broad index that allows comparison of the companys performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole.
Over the five year period, the company has substantially out-performed both the All-Share Index excluding Investment Trusts and the Support Services index.
An investment of 100 in the company on 1 April 2002 would have delivered a return of 327.
The second graph below right also prepared by Inbucon shows comparative TSR performance over the same period against the FTSE Support Services Sector, the sector in which the Companys share price is reported.

In reviewing base pay and remuneration the company considers both companies of a similar size generally as well as pay levels specically in the support service sector.
Balance of remuneration The balance of remuneration for executive Directors is set so that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to performance, either short or long term.
The balance for the Chief Executive officer and the Group Finance Director is shown in the graphs below, L-TIP awards are valued on a projected value basis and the graph assumes full achievement of bonus potential.
Chief Executive Officer Group Finance Director 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Key: Fixed Elements Variable element n Base pay n Annual bonus n Benefits n L-TIPS Mr Campbell as part-time Chairman has a remuneration package where the performance related element is just over 50% of potential remuneration.
Other non-executive Directors only receive xed fees.
Internal relativity The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the group as a whole and is satisfied that the approach taken by the company is fair and reasonable in the light of current market practice and in the best interests of shareholders.
Shareholding requirements The Board encourages executive Directors to use company shares acquired under option or L-TIP schemes to build and maintain, over time, a personal holding of shares equivalent in value to around a years basic pay.
Basic pay Basic pay is considered against other companies in terms of size, comparing revenues, number of employees and market capitalisation, and companies in the support services sector.
Against these data sources taken as a whole, the companys basic pay is normally about the median.
Basic pay is reviewed annually against the market.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors fees are reviewed against market practice at least every three years by the Chairman and the executive Directors, to whom the task has been delegated by the Board.
Performance-related rewards: Annual bonus schemes: The Remuneration Committee determines a performance-related annual bonus scheme for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame at the beginning of each financial year.
Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
For the year ended 31 March 2007, the annual bonuses payable to Mr Rogers and Mr Tame were dependent on a combination of the profit before tax and operating cash ow achieved by the group as against budget and growth in profit before tax over the prior financial year, because these are key indicators of group performance.
In addition, the Committee has discretion to reduce or extinguish the bonus achieved if they consider health, safety and now environmental performance warrants it.
Maximum bonus potential was 100% of qualifying salary for Mr Rogers which for the year was 400,000 and 80% of basic salary excluding car allowance and other supplements for Mr Tame.
Maximum bonuses were earned, as profit growth was at least 20%.
The Committee has adopted similar schemes for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame for the current financial year.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives: During the financial year, L-TIP awards were made to each of Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr Tame of 100% of their qualifying basic salaries.
The vesting of the awards is based on the achievement of performance criteria, half being comparative TSR performance against a specic comparator list and half based upon EPS growth.
Further details of the performance criteria are set out on pages 36 and 37.
Details of options and L-TIP awards held by the Directors are set out on pages 35 and 36.
To aid recruitment and retention, for certain divisional senior managers, but not the companys Directors, there is a cash-based long-term incentive scheme.
This scheme has a performance period of four years and the performance targets are set by reference to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash ow, as most appropriate to the divisions business.
A similar scheme is in place for senior group employees but not the companys Directors based on eps growth over the period.
Target bonuses under this scheme vary between participants but will not normally exceed a years basic salary.
Directors pensions Only Mr Tame currently participates in a group pension scheme.
A summary of Mr Tames pension entitlements is set out at page 34.
Neither Mr Campbell nor Mr Rogers receives pension benets from the company: their salaries take this into account.
The companys policy is to remain competitive in the market place to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.
Subject to that, it is not the companys policy to compensate Directors for tax changes or changes to the taxation of pensions.

For Mr Tame, benets comprised home to work travel expenses, medical insurance and accommodation expenses.
For Mr Rogers they comprised medical insurance.
For Sir Nigel Essenhigh they comprised home to work travel expenses.
The fees for Lord Hesketh reect his additional duties as Deputy Chairman.
Mr Rennocks and Mr Shahs fees reect their additional duties as Chairmen of, respectively, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
Bonus payments and benets in kind are not pensionable.
Directors pensions audited Babcock International Group Pension Scheme the scheme Mr Tame is a member of the upper tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme.
No other Directors are members of the scheme or receive pension benets from the group.
The accrual rate for Mr Tame under the scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his base salary up to the schemes earnings cap in the 12 months prior to attaining age 60.
Membership of the scheme also entitles him to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap.
For these purposes the earnings cap means the statutory earnings cap that applied up to 5 April 2006 and, thereafter, the earnings cap adopted by the scheme as part of its rules which is the same as the former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way.
The company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four times his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Mr Tames pension entitlements under the scheme dened benefit are set out in the following table: Increase in accrued benets Transfer value excluding Change in of increase in ination accrued accrued Increase in Accrued during the benets Transfer Transfer benets transfer value pension at year ended after value at value at less less 31 March 31 March allowing 1 April 31 March Directors Directors 2007 2007 for ination 2006 2007 contributions contributions Director pa pa W Tame 19,141 4,048 3,505 211,482 312,238 30,170 89,006 1 Ination has been taken as 3.6% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned.
2 The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting members contributions.
3 The gures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benets under the Scheme.
4 The gures in the above table make no allowance for any benets in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
5 In calculating the above gures for Mr W Tame no account has been taken of any retained benets which he may have from previous employments.
6 No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benets first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997.
Babcock International Group PLC 35 Annual report and accounts 2007 Other pension arrangements audited Before 1 April 2006, in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap, the company had established a Funded Unapproved Retirement benefit Scheme FURBS for Mr Tame.
The company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with Mr Tame making contributions into the companys pension scheme on his full uncapped salary.
As from April 2006 this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with Mr Tame contributing into the companys pension scheme only on capped salary.
The cost to the company of the salary supplement arrangement is the same as was the case for the FURBS arrangement.
The amount of contributions made to Mr Tames own pension plans or arrangements, including the cost of providing any additional life assurance cover, are set out in the table below: 2007 2006 Director 000 000 W Tame 2 12 Life insurance benefit only: no pension contributions.
Directors share options audited Details of Directors share options all of which are now vested and exercisable are set out in the table below and the notes beneath it: Number Number of shares of shares subject to subject to options at Granted Exercised Lapsed options at Exercise Option 1 April during during during 31 March price Exercisable Director scheme 2006 the year the year the year 2007 pence from Expiry date G A Campbell a 560,975 560,975 123.00 Nov 2003 Nov 2010 c 209,104 209,104 99.33 Jun 2004 Jun 2011 c 317,590 317,590 124.50 Jun 2005 Jun 2012 P L Rogers a 401,606 401,606 124.50 Jun 2005 Jun 2012 W Tame b 21,278 21,278 104.33 Jan 2005 Jan 2012 c 148,951 148,951 104.33 Jan 2005 Jan 2012 c 198,125 198,125 124.50 Jun 2005 Jun 2012 a Share Option Agreement agreed as part of the terms of recruitment.
b Babcock 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme.
c Babcock 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme.
These options vested according to performance targets based on comparative TSR performance over three-year performance periods, which were set on grant and not subject to re-testing.
The comparator group was the companies who at the date of grant comprised the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector, in which the company then appeared.
There was no vesting unless the companys ranking at the end of the performance period was at least immediately above median in which case 25% of the options vested, with 100% vesting for top quartile ranking and proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.
The exercise prices of the options were not set at a discount to the market value of the companys shares at the date of grant.
They were set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the companys shares for the three business days preceding the date of the grant.
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of control, they leave or die, failing which they will lapse.
There were no changes in the Directors share options between 31 March 2007 and 22 May 2007.
Vesting date depends on the date of notication of the vesting, which must be after announcement of results for the final year of the applicable performance period.
The above table assumes that the announcement is made in May and notication of vesting given in the same month.
The companys mid-market share price at close of business on 30 March 2007 the last dealing day before the close of the financial year was 399.75p.
The highest and lowest mid-market share prices in the year ended 30 March 2007 were 449.75p and 299.50p respectively.
The L-TIP awards that vested during the year were those granted in July 2003.
The market value of those shares on award was 113.5p per share.
On the date of vesting, 15 June 2006, they had a market value of 306p per share, being the mid-market closing price on that day.
The performance conditions attached to the award are described below.
All the L-TIP awards made to Directors to date have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust as conditional rights to acquire shares effectively nil cost options, and the number of shares awarded was based on qualifying annual salary at the date of taking the award and the average of the mid-market closing price of the companys shares for the three business days preceding that date.
Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria see below attached to the awards, the Directors may call for the release to them of the shares subject to the awards during the above shown exercise periods.
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control, but normally of not more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having regard to the companys performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released.
Performance measures attached to L-TIP awards Performance targets set by the Committee for L-TIP awards have regard to market conditions and the need to ensure that they serve the purpose of motivating and retaining key staff.
Performance is judged over the period of three financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award is made.
Performance is measured at the end of the period.
There is no retesting of performance.
For L-TIP awards made in 2003 there could be no vesting unless the companys earnings per share pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2006 was at least 9.27% representing a 3% per annum compound growth rate greater than the basic earnings per share pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items for the financial year ended 31 March 2003.
Once this hurdle was achieved, actual levels of vesting depended on the comparative total shareholder return TSR performance of the company as at 31 March 2006 against the shares of the companies comprising the FTSE All-Share Index other than Investment Trusts on 1 April 2003.
This group was selected at a time when the company had left the Engineering and Machinery Sector, but its transition to a broader-based support services company was not yet complete.
The target provided for no vesting for at or below median ranking, 25% vesting for immediately above median ranking and 100% vesting for top quartile ranking with proportionate straight-line vesting in between.
In the event they vested as to 99.4%.
For L-TIP awards made after 2003, half of each award vests according to comparative TSR performance measured against a specified list of companies with similar businesses see below, and half according to growth in earnings per share.
This approach will be taken with any awards made in the current financial year.
Babcock International Group PLC 37 Annual report and accounts 2007 For the half of the share awards for which vesting depends on comparative TSR performance a ranking immediately above the median level in the comparator table results in 25% of those shares vesting with no vesting for ranking at or below median.
A ranking in the top quartile results in 100% vesting.
Rankings between these threshold levels result in proportionate vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%.
The comparator group of listed companies for the 2004, 2005 and, apart from PHS Group in 2006 2006 were: AEA Technology, W. S. Atkins, Aggreko, AMEC, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing John, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, and WSP Group.
The comparator group was chosen after consultation with Inbucon, with a view to giving an appropriate range of support services providers against which to compare the company having regard to the nature of its and their businesses.
The comparator group for use in any awards made in 2007 is under review, but is likely to be substantially the same as the above, with the exception of PHS Group and Laing, but with the possible addition of one or more other companies after further consultation with Inbucon and the companys brokers.
For the half of the post 2003 L-TIP awards where vesting depends on earnings per share growth, 25% of the shares vest if that growth adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation over the performance period is equivalent to a real i. e. in excess of the growth in the consumer prices index compound annual growth rate of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches 8%.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points.
There is no vesting for compound annual earnings per share growth of below 4%.
It is policy that L-TIP awards are made only to Directors of the company and a limited number of other senior executives who are key to the group.
The initial market value of the shares over which any such award is made in any year may be up to 100% of the amount of the participants qualifying basic annual salary at the date of grant subject to any adjustment that may be made to reect the payment of employers National Insurance.
Service contracts The following tables set out a summary of the Directors service contracts or terms of appointment: Chairman and executive Directors Name Date of service contract Unexpired term Notice period G A Campbell 31 July 2003 12 months 12 months from company, 6 months from Director Chairman amended by letters dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 P L Rogers 31 July 2003 12 months 12 months from company, 6 months from Director Group Chief amended by letters Executive officer dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 W Tame 20 September 2001 12 months 12 months from company, 6 months from Director Group amended by letters Financial Director dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 The companys policy for Directors service contracts is that they be capable of being terminated by the company on not more than 12 months notice.
The company reserves the right to terminate the contracts without full notice by payment of basic salary in lieu of notice.
If the company terminates a Directors service contract other than following a change of control see below or by the exercise of the companys option to pay salary in lieu of notice the company will have regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination.
Although the agreements for Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr Tame contain provisions relating to a change of control, as described below, the Company believes that they do no more than reect what would in effect be a likely outcome in practice for these positions following a change of control.
The provisions are as follows.
The contracts provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control the Director may terminate his employment forthwith.
If he exercises this right, he will, however, only be entitled to be paid, for up to a period of 12 months, on a monthly basis, his basic salary plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, 40% in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements but any amount that they receive by way of income from other sources within that 12 month period, if it exceeds 10% of their salary, that they would not have been able to earn had they continued in employment with the company is deductible from the amounts otherwise payable by the company.
If the company terminates the Directors appointment within 12 months of a change of control, the Director is entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of his annual salary plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, an additional 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benets.

For non-executive Directors the companys policy is to have written terms of appointment, with initial appointments normally being for a three-year term, though in all cases appointments are terminable at will by the company or the Director.
The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the companys registered ofce and at the companys Annual General Meeting.
The expected time commitment of non-executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment.
Outside directorships The company considers that it can benefit if a Director, executive or non-executive, holds directorships in other companies outside the group.
Before taking up any new outside appointment, a Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman.
Any fees for outside appointments are retained by the Director.
Mr Tame, executive Director, is a non-executive Director of Carclo plc.
During the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007, his fees for this position were 25,000.
