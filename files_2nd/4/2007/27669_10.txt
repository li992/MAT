or affecting the structure of the Companys share incentive Executive directors remuneration during 2007 The Committee reviews the structure of the executive directors remuneration packages annually to satisfy itself that the balance between fixed and variable remuneration and short-term and long-term incentives and rewards remains appropriate.
A summary description of the different elements of the executive directors remuneration packages for 2007 is set out in the table below.
Changes to this structure from 2008 onwards are described later in this report.
Base salary Base salary is paid monthly in cash and reviewed with effect from 1 January each year, taking into account market benchmarks for the director concerned, as well as any changes in role or responsibilities.
Benefits A cash-based benefits package approach is used.
During 2007, the executive directors received: a benefit allowance of 35% of base salary which may be used to purchase benefits from independent suppliers or to participate in benefit arrangements established for Group employees in the UK: life cover of four times base salary, and disability cover capped at 140,000 per annum: and 30 working days paid holiday.
Annual short-term incentive The annual short-term incentive for 2007 was based on achievement of Group financial targets and Skandia financial targets for Mr Roberts as well as delivery of individually agreed objectives.
The maximum award was 130% of base salary, of which two thirds was payable in cash and one third was to be deferred for three years in restricted shares.
Bonus-matching shares A one-for-one, gross-for-net after tax and NIC bonus match, in restricted shares, was offered on any portion of the cash element of the short-term incentive used to purchase Company shares.
Bonus-matching shares vest, subject to: a continued employment with the Group, b achievement of an EPS-based corporate performance target as set out in the section of this report entitled Performance targets applicable to share incentives, and c retention for the entire three-year period of the shares purchased using the cash element of the short-term incentive.
Share options The grant of share options to the executive directors is determined each year in the light of relative market positioning of their total remuneration against market benchmarks.
During 2007, the Committee determined that awards of share options equal to 200% of base salary should be made to Mr Sutcliffe and 100% of base salary should be made to each of Mr Nicholls and Mr Roberts.
Share options vest, subject to the achievement of EPS-based corporate performance targets as set out in the Performance targets applicable to share incentives section below.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 85 Total remuneration 2007 The value of total remuneration for Executive Directors in 2007 has been determined as follows: actual values reflect amounts paid in base salary, benefits allowance, short-term and deferred short-term incentives provided in restricted share awards and the expected value of actual share awards made: hypothetical values have been used for target and maximum incentive levels by assuming that the respective short-term targets are achieved and the bonus match offer is maximised in each case: the expected value of long-term incentives awarded in 2007 has been derived by discounting the value of both share options and bonus matching share awards by 30%, for the impact of the hurdles applied to vesting.
Share option awards are valued on a costto-company basis, which is currently 25% of the market value of the underlying shares, before the 30% discount is applied.

The Old Mutual Staff Pension Fund During 2007: the Company contributed a total of 20,000 to the Old Mutual Staff Pension Fund which is a defined contribution scheme in lieu of an equivalent cash payment under Mr Roberts benefit allowance.
The accumulated value of Mr Roberts funds in the scheme was 214,300 at 31 December 2007 179,400 at 31 December 2006. the Company did not make any contributions to the Old Mutual Staff Pension Fund on Mr Sutcliffes behalf.
The accumulated value of his funds in the scheme was 125,100 at 31 December 2007 116,000 at 31 December 2006.
Mr Nicholls does not participate in any employer-provided pension scheme, but has a self-invested personal pension with Skandia UK.
Furnished accommodation for Mr Roberts Between March 2006 and September 2007, Mr Roberts was provided with furnished accommodation in Stockholm in order to enable him to fulfil his role at Skandia.
The total cost of this accommodation during 2007 was 33,000.
This arrangement has now come to an end.

The amount of this expenditure is reported to and considered by the Committee, and procedures are in place for such costs to be authorised.
The Committee is satisfied that such expenditure is reasonable and in the interests of the Company.
2 Mr Nicholls took unpaid paternity leave during 2007 forgoing base salary of 5,000.
3 The total short-term incentive is payable two thirds in cash and one third in the form of a restricted share award.
The cash element for 2007 227,000 for Mr Nicholls, 229,000 for Mr Roberts and 332,000 for Mr Sutcliffe may be used for the purposes of the bonus-matching arrangement described under the Executive Directors Remuneration during 2007 section above.
The cash incentives for 2006 were applied net of tax, as to 236,000 gross in the case of Mr Roberts and as to 364,000 gross in the case of Mr Sutcliffe to purchase shares in the Company under the bonus-matching arrangement.
4 As part of Mr Nicholls offer of employment, the Company agreed to buy out his bonus entitlement with his previous employer by way of a cash payment of 300,000 in March 2007, which Mr Nicholls elected to use, net of tax, to purchase Old Mutual plc shares under the bonus-matching arrangement.
5 Includes a payment of 62,500 2007 and 12,500 2006 in compensation for the loss of fees resulting from Mr Nicholls resignation as a non-executive director of another listed FTSE 100 financial services group, which was agreed as a condition of appointment.
6 Includes a cost of 33,000 2007 and 35,000 2006 in respect of the cost of Mr Roberts furnished accommodation in Stockholm.
7 The Company made pension contributions in lieu of an equivalent cash payment under Mr Roberts benefit allowance.
12 The prior year comparative number as published in the Remuneration Report for 2006 was 4,134,000, which included 138,000 paid to non-executive directors who retired during that year.
The executive directors were required to waive fees for non-executive directorships held in subsidiary companies totalling 45,000 during the year ended 31 December 2007 in favour of the Company or its subsidiaries.
These waivers are expected to remain in force in the future.
Mr Sutcliffe received and retained fees totalling 22,000 during 2007 relating to his position as non-executive director of Lonmin plc.
Governance Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 88 Remuneration Report continued Changes to executive directors remuneration in 2008 Certain changes to the executive directors remuneration arrangements have been approved by the Committee for 2008 and are set out below.
These changes were based on a detailed analysis of the market undertaken in 2007 to coincide with the implementation of new share incentive plans which are to be put forward to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting in 2008.
The Committee reviewed tailored benchmarking data provided by NBSC in FTSE pan-sector by market capitalisation and the finance sector to assist in determining the size of the annual short-term and long-term incentive awards.
This analysis showed that the incentive structure that applied in 2007 did not provide the potential for executive directors to reach the market upper quartile for total remuneration, even if they achieved the maximum level of short-term incentive.
The new structure, which applies with effect from the 2008 performance year, is intended to rectify this and provide an opportunity to achieve upper quartile total remuneration on an expected value analysis where the maximum annual incentive is achieved.
This restructure required an adjustment to base salaries, realignment of the annual incentive, removal of the stand-alone long-term incentive share option awards and an enhancement of the bonus-matching arrangement.
The total remuneration position was then assessed against the market data provided by NBSC.
After the restructure, if target level bonuses are achieved, the executive directors will still fall below the market median total remuneration for the lower subset of data provided by NBSC market capitalisation sample.
At maximum annual bonus levels, however, using expected value assumptions for share awards, the new structure offers the potential for the executive directors to achieve a top-quartile position against the same survey sample.
Base salary The base salaries of the executive directors were increased from 1 January 2008 as shown in the table below.
These increases were considered by the Committee to be appropriate in the light of comparative FTSE financial services sector and market capitalisation median benchmarks.
Percentage 2007 2008 increase Executive director 000 000 % J C Nicholls 500 525 5 J V F Roberts 500 525 5 J H Sutcliffe 735 800 9 Annual short-term incentive The maximum short-term incentive award has been increased from 130% of base salary in 2007 to 150% of base salary for the 2008 performance year, of which two-thirds is to be paid in cash and one-third is to be deferred for three years in restricted shares.
Short-term incentive targets for performance year 2008 The respective weightings attached to the Group metrics shown as a percentage of base salary for the executive directors short-term incentives for 2008 are as follows: J H Sutcliffe J C Nicholls J V F Roberts Metrics Group % Group % Group % Skandia % IFRS Earnings 51 51 12 15 Return on Equity 51 51 12 15 EEV Earnings 25.5 25.5 6 7.5 Return on Embedded Value 7.5 Net client cash flows 7.5 Synergies other 15 Sub-total 127.5127.53067.5 Personal objectives 22.5 22.5 52.5 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 89 Bonus match The bonus-matching plan in operation for 2007 provided a one-for-one, gross-for-net after tax and NIC match in restricted shares on any portion of the cash element of the short-term incentive used to purchase Company shares personal shares.
The new bonusmatching plan, for the 2008 performance year onwards, provides for a two-for-one, gross-for-net after tax and NIC bonus match on any portion of the cash element of the short-term incentive used to purchase personal shares.
The Committee intends, in respect of the awards to be granted in 2009, to make half of the award in restricted shares and half in share options.
This ratio will be considered by the Committee each year.
The number of options to be granted will be based on an equivalent cost to company value of an option in relation to a share award at the time of each grant.
The current calculation is that the cost to the Company of four shares under option is equivalent to one share under award, where the same performance targets are applied to both.
Bonus-matching shares vest, subject to: a continued employment with the Group for the three-year vesting period, b the achievement of performance targets as described below, and c retention for the entire three-year period of the personal shares backing the match.
As a result of the incentive restructure, the grant of stand-alone share options as a long-term incentive will no longer apply.
The full LTI award is therefore linked to the success of the executive directors in delivering annual performance.
If there is no annual incentive payment, the Committee has discretion to allow the executive directors to invest their own money to purchase Old Mutual plc shares up to the target level of the annual cash bonus and hold them for a period of three years in order to obtain a matching share award.
Performance targets for the bonus match The Company and the Committee have given much thought to the choice of appropriate performance metrics for the LTI awards that will be made from 2009.
The metrics proposed at the inception of the plan are as follows: IFRS EPS growth above UK RPI: RoAE Return on Average Equity based on the average of the annual RoAE achieved in the three-year period: and Revenue growth using growth in Assets x Margins as the measure.
The Committee is satisfied that this structure supports the strategy of the Company and that the performance measures proposed reflect the drivers of underlying performance and should result in long-term delivery of shareholder value.
The following chart depicts the overall make-up of the executive directors respective remuneration packages for 2008, assuming on-target rather than maximum delivery on the short-term incentive and an expected value for the long-term incentive.

Shares under award or option Name of Plan Description at 31 Dec 2007 Share Option and Deferred Delivery Plan SOP The purpose of the SOP is to grant share options as a long-term incentive to qualifying senior employees.
Grants are phased annually so that no undue incentive arises in relation to any year of maturity.
39,645,508 Restricted Share Plan RSP The purpose of the RSP is: i To assist in the recruitment of key individuals by making awards of shares, restricted for three or more years, which lapse on prior termination of employment unless special circumstances apply: and ii to support retention of key talent by a contingent share awards that form the deferred element of an annual incentive award, based upon performance evaluation for the prior year: and b bonus matching awards.
21,071,553 UK Sharesave Plan Sharesave The purpose of Sharesave is to provide a savings and investment opportunity for employees of the Groups participating UK businesses, which encourages share ownership at all levels.
Options are granted for threeor five-year periods at a discount of up to 20% from the market price during a reference period shortly before the date of grant.
6,264,838 The following plans were introduced in 2005 as part of the Companys Black Economic Empowerment BEE transactions for Old Mutual South Africa OMSA and were extended during 2006 as part of the Companys BEE transactions for Old Mutual Namibia OMN.
The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan This plan is designed to reward all permanent staff of OMSA and OMN who were not in any of the Companys other share schemes with a one-off award of shares.
Grants of share awards in respect of the South African BEE transactions were made in October 2005 and in respect of Namibian BEE transactions in April 2007.
There is currently no intention for further awards to be made to South African or Namibian employees under this plan.
5,641,904 The OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan This plan is designed to assist OMSA and OMN in attracting and retaining senior black managers in light of the increased competition for talented and experienced black management.
It provides for the award of restricted shares and the grant of share options.
Grants are made in addition to the normal annual share incentive allocations under the OMSA Management Incentive Share Plan.
16,238,925 The OMSA Management Incentive Share Plan MISP The MISP is designed to attract, retain and reward senior and middle management.
It provides for awards of both restricted shares and share options on similar terms and conditions to the SOP and RSP.
25,565,524 Total shares held under award or option at 31 December 2007 114,428,252 Change of control Under the rules of the respective schemes, in the event of a change of control: options granted under the SOP and awards granted under the RSP would vest in full: options granted under the MISP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such options are subject have been met: and ii on a pro-rata basis to reflect the reduction in the length of the original performance period: restricted share awards granted under the MISP and the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan would vest in full: and options and restricted share awards granted under the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan would vest in full.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 91 The Committee has reviewed the operation of the current share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
Information about the Companys new share incentive plans, which are intended to replace the SOP, the RSP and the Sharesave Plan, is contained in the shareholder circular relating to the Companys 2008 Annual General Meeting.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs, through which it collateralises some of its obligations under employee share schemes.
The Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust is used to satisfy awards under the RSP excluding South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe and the strategy is to hold shares approximately equal to the number of shares awarded, but not yet vested, at any time.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future awards.
There are various employee share trusts in existence in South Africa and Namibia relating to current and historic share incentive schemes.
The strategy for each scheme has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares were acquired to match at least 90% of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the Companys BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in the relevant BEE employee share trusts immediately, in order to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in terms of the BEE transactions up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
The general practice of the ESOTs shown in the table below save for the BEE-related trusts is not to vote shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneficiaries of restricted shares may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
However, with respect to the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Trust, the OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust, the Trustees may vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts as well as those shares held in respect of any unexercised share options.
The beneficiaries of any restricted shares allocated by these BEE employee share trusts are entitled to vote their relevant shares.
At 31 December 2007, the following shares in the Company were held in ESOTs: Old Mutual plc Trust Country shares held in trust 1 Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 1,713,762 Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust Guernsey 13,388,197 2 OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust Namibia 904,224 2 OMN Management Incentive Trust Namibia 2,234,800 3 OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust South Africa 30,512,478 3 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 83,645,335 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 29,930,587 Total 162,329,383 1 The Capital Growth Investment Trust is used to satisfy restricted share awards or Deferred Delivery Shares in Zimbabwe under a locally run scheme.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future grants.
2 The OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust were established during 2006 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its Namibian BEE ownership transactions.
The OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of the Namibian awards under both the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan and the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan, while the OMN Management Incentive Trust holds shares for Namibian awards under the OMSA MISP.
Awards to white employees in Namibia under the OMSA MISP are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
3 The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMSA Management Incentive Trust were established during 2005 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its South African BEE ownership transactions.
The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of both the OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Plan and the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan, while the OMSA Management Incentive Trust holds shares for the OMSA MISP.
Awards to white employees under the OMSA MISP are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
Dilution limits In accordance with the governing rules of the various share incentive plans, there is a maximum dilution limit of 10% over a 10-year period of the Companys issued ordinary share capital under all share incentive plans and a 6% limit over a 10-year period under executive share incentive plans.
Shareholder approval was obtained at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 6 July 2005 for the latter limit to be increased to 6% from its previous level of 5% as a result of the Companys South African BEE ownership transactions.
The new share incentive plans being submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2008 revert back to a 5% limit over a 10-year period for executive share incentive plans.
For the purposes of calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares e. g. shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any option that has lapsed are disregarded.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
At 31 December 2007, the Company had 2.79% of share capital available under the 6% in five years limit and 6.47% of share capital available under the 10% in 10 years limit.
The issued share capital figure used for this calculation has not been reduced to reflect shares bought back into treasury by the Company.
Governance Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 92 Remuneration Report continued Subsidiaries share incentive schemes The Companys separately-listed subsidiaries, Nedbank Group Limited and Mutual & Federal Insurance Company Limited, have their own share incentive schemes, which are under the control of the Remuneration Committees of their respective boards and are not further addressed in this Report.
None of the executive directors of the Company has any interest under such subsidiary share incentive schemes.
Performance targets applicable to share incentives The vesting of executive share options and, in certain cases, restricted share awards, is subject to the successful achievement of EPS-based targets.
In choosing performance targets for the SOP, the RSP and the MISP, the Committee has considered the merits of EPS-based targets against alternative possibilities and determined that EPS-based targets were appropriate and sufficiently demanding in the context of the Companys market environment, prevailing circumstances and prospects.
Prior to 2006, EPS was measured on a UK GAAP basis and after the introduction of IFRS, on an IFRS basis.
As a result of the acquisition of Skandia, existing unvested awards were converted to an EEV EPS basis and the 2006 awards were also based on EEV EPS.
Both conversions from UK GAAP to IFRS and subsequently to EEV EPS were validated with KPMG Audit Plc and the rationale for the use of EEV EPS targets following the Skandia acquisition was set out in the resolution approved by shareholders in November 2005.
In 2007 the Committee determined that IFRS EPS targets should once again be applied and intends to use that basis for awards to be made during 2008: however, these will be the last awards to be granted with EPS as the only target.
The metrics and structure of targets applying to the 2008 performance cycle, with first awards to be made in 2009, are set out above in the section of this report entitled Changes to executive directors remuneration in 2008.
Group HR prepares the analysis of EPS performance, and the calculations are independently checked by KPMG Audit Plc.
This process is, in the opinion of the Committee, appropriate for confirming whether or not the performance targets have been fulfilled.
A summary of the targets attached to the unvested share options and restricted share awards is set out in the table below.
Plans covered Year of grant by targets Target 1 Target 2 Target 3 For applicable RSP awards and For tier 2 of share option awards For tier 3 of share option awards tier 1 of share option awards between 100% and 200% in excess of 200% of up to 100% of base salary of base salary base salary 2005 SOP Growth in EEV EPS: For 50%, Growth in EEV EPS: For 50%, Growth in EEV EPS: For 50%, MISP must exceed growth in the must exceed growth in must exceed growth in 1 RSP UK Retail Price Index UK RPI UK RPI by at least 12% over UK RPI by at least 15% over by at least 9% over the the three-year vesting period the three-year vesting period three-year vesting period For 50%, must exceed growth For 50%, must exceed growth For 50%, must exceed growth in the South African Consumer in SA CPI by at least 12% in SA CPI by at least 15% Price Index SA CPI by at over the three-year over the three-year least 9% over the three-year vesting period vesting period vesting period 2006 SOP Growth in EEV EPS must Growth in EEV EPS must Growth in EEV EPS must MISP exceed growth in UK RPI exceed growth in UK RPI exceed growth in UK RPI 1 RSP by at least 9% over the by at least 12% over the by at least 15% over the three-year vesting period three-year vesting period three-year vesting period 2007 SOP Growth in IFRS EPS must Growth in IFRS EPS must Growth in IFRS EPS must MISP exceed growth in UK RPI exceed growth in UK RPI exceed growth in UK RPI 1 RSP by at least 9% over the by at least 12% over the by at least 15% over the three-year vesting period three-year vesting period three-year vesting period 1 Target 1 applies to the bonus-matching restricted share awards granted between 2005 and 2007 and also to the deferred short-term incentive restricted share awards granted to the executive directors in 2005.
There have been no changes in the directors interests in any of the Groups employee share plans between 31 December 2007 and 27 February 2008.
Governance Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 94 Remuneration Report continued 1 Subject to the fulfilment of performance targets prescribed by the Committee, under which: options and restricted shares granted in 2006 are subject to a Sterling-denominated EPS performance target requiring growth in EEV EPS to exceed growth in UK RPI by at least 9% over the 3-year vesting period: options and restricted shares granted in 2007 are subject to a Sterling-denominated EPS performance target requiring growth in IFRS EPS to exceed growth in UK RPI by at least 9% over the 3-year vesting period: as a result of the acquisition of Skandia, the Company converted the targets for awards granted between 2004 and 2006 from IFRS EPS-based targets to EEV EPS-based targets.
2 Options under the SOP and the deferred STI RSP awards granted on 30 March 2007 were based on the closing middle market price of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange on 29 March 2007, namely 162.60p.
The award under the SOP granted to Mr Sutcliffe was over shares with a market value equal to 200% of his base salary at the time of grant, while the grant to Mr Roberts was over shares with a market value equal to 100% of his base salary at the time of grant.
The award to Mr Nicholls consisted of a joining grant with a market value of 1,425,000 and an annual grant with a market value equal to 100% of his base salary at the time of grant.
3 The number of shares awarded under the RSP bonus match on 30 March 2007 was calculated by reference to a price of 164.32p per share, being the price at which the matching shares were acquired by the Trust.
4 The restricted share award granted to Mr Nicholls on 30 March 2007 was in respect of a buy-out of an entitlement with his previous employer.
As a result, the vesting of the award, which occurs in equal thirds on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant, is not subject to the achievement of performance targets.
5 Mr Roberts sold 260,891 of the shares released and retained 96,109 shares.
6 Mr Roberts sold 100,194 of the shares released and retained 42,806 shares.
7 As a result of the successful achievement of tier 1 of the EEV EPS-based performance targets, the options and restricted share awards granted on 26 and 27 April 2005 respectively will vest in full on 26 and 27 April 2008.
8 Mr Roberts sold 14,686 of the shares released to cover his income tax and employee National Insurance Contribution liabilities and retained 21,009 shares.
Mr Sutcliffe sold 34,557 of the shares released to cover his income tax and employee National Insurance Contribution liabilities and retained 49,432 shares.
9 The Sharesave option price was determined as 20% below the average of the Companys share price between 5 and 9 May 2005.
The Companys share price at the date of grant 27 May 2005 was 120p.
10 Mr Sutcliffe retained all of the shares exercised.
11 Mr Sutcliffe sold 350,000 of the shares exercised and retained 46,950 shares.
12 Mr Sutcliffe retained all of the shares exercised.
13 The Sharesave option price was determined as 20% below the average of the Companys share price between 7 and 11 March 2002.
The Companys share price at the date of grant 5 April 2002 was 109p.
14 The Sharesave option price was determined as 20% below the average of the Companys share price between 13 and 15 March 2007.
The Companys share price at the date of grant 4 April 2007 was 166.5p.
Executive directors shareholding requirements The Committee has established guidelines on shareholdings by executive directors of the Company.
Under these, the Chief Executive is expected to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to at least 150% of annual base salary within five years of appointment: the equivalent figure for other executive directors is 100% of annual base salary.
For the purposes of the calculations, unvested restricted share awards are excluded.
The following table shows Old Mutual plc shares held by executive directors at 31 December 2007 including holdings by connected persons compared to the shareholding requirements prescribed by these guidelines.

2 J C Nicholls also holds 876,384 unvested restricted shares which are subject to time-vesting only.
Current exposure The current exposure of the executive directors to the Companys share price is shown in the table below.
This includes shares owned outright including holdings by connected persons, and the intrinsic value market share price at 31 December 2007 less the weighted average option exercise price of options already vested.
It excludes unvested share options and restricted share awards that are subject to performance targets, although the executive directors do have further exposure to the Companys share price in this respect.

Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Remuneration Report 95 Company share price performance The market price of the Companys shares was 167.6p at 31 December 2007 and ranged from a low of 144p to a high of 187.5p during 2007.
The following graph shows the total shareholder return to 1 January 2008 on 100 invested in shares in Old Mutual plc on 1 January 2003 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index.
The other points are the comparative returns at the intervening financial year ends.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index against which to measure total shareholder return of the Company, as it is an index of which Old Mutual plc is a member and is located where the Company has its primary listing.
The Board and the Committee also have regard to a variety of other sector-specific comparators in reviewing performance.
