Mr A S Ross is no longer accruing pension benefits or receiving any pension-related cash supplement as he has passed his nominal pension retirement date.
He is a member of the Executive Section of the LPP and his LPP benefits will be increased between his 60th birthday and the date he starts to receive benefits to reflect the delay in payment, using late retirement factors which apply to all members of the LPP.
He received a tax-free retirement lump sum of 392,000 in 2006.
Mr B G Wallace is not a member of the LPP and receives a cash supplement of 30 per cent of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP since he re-joined the Group on 5 March 2007.
The pension benefits accrued during his previous employment with the Group were transferred to non-Group pension arrangements in 2006 and so are not included in these disclosures.
The transfer value figures below have been provided by the independent actuary appointed by the Trustees of the LPP, in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN 11.
The accrued pension benefit is an annual figure.
The transfer value represents the amount that would be paid to another pension scheme if this accrued pension benefit were to be transferred away from the LPP.

For executive directors other than Mr A S Ross, the transfer value increase over the year includes the effect of each directors increase in Pensionable Salary, completing a further year of service and being a year closer to their nominal pension retirement date.
For all executive directors, the change in transfer value over the year also reflects changes in market conditions and a change in the LPPs standard transfer value terms.
A transfer value represents a liability of the LPP but not a sum paid or due to the individual.
