Remuneration report 2007 26 27 This report sets out the role and remit of the Remuneration Committee and its membership.
It describes the Groups overall remuneration policy and gives details of the compensation arrangements for Directors for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The report has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Role of the Committee The Committees role is to review and approve the remuneration strategy and policies for the Group including the approach for the Groups annual compensation review.
It is also responsible for determining the remuneration of the executive Directors, and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management generally.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference in October 2007 and proposed certain minor amendments, to bring them in line with those of the other Board Committees, that were approved by the Board on 22 November 2007.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available at www.
com or from the Company Secretary.
Composition of the Committee The current members of the Committee, unchanged throughout 2007, are: Sir Peter Job Chairman Andrew Beeson Kevin Parry The Committee met on four occasions during 2007 and there was full attendance at all meetings.
Other non-executive Directors as well as the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and senior Human Resources executives attend by invitation but they play no part in the determination of their own remuneration arrangements.
The Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, McLagan Partners Inc. and Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited as its external advisers.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provided advice to the Committee on equity incentive plans and to the Group on the implementation of these plans.
McLagan Partners Inc. provided the Committee with an interpretation of external market compensation levels and practices and also provided information and advice to management on the external market.
Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited provide advice to the Committee and the Group on domestic and international pensions issues, as well as acting as the actuarial advisers to, and administrators of, the UK pension scheme.
McLagan Partners Inc. attended two meetings of the Committee during 2007.
Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain the talent the Group needs in order to help it to achieve its strategic objectives, while ensuring that the ratio of total compensation costs to a measure of net operating revenues for the Group is within a target determined by the Board.
The Board determines the target aggregate ratio ahead of the performance year as part of the annual Budget process, and an analysis of competitor ratios is provided to the Board.
At the end of each financial year the Committee is advised of the level of fixed compensation expense and then approves the amount distributable as variable compensation across the Group.
The ratio of total compensation costs to operating revenues in 2007 was 46 per cent.
The broader context for this ratio is covered in the business review on page 9.
The Committee believes that total compensation must reflect the global competition for talent in an industry in which successful people are highly rewarded and mobile.
The Group compensates all of its employees, including executive Directors, by balancing fixed and variable compensation.
Fixed compensation, in the form of base salary, pensions and other benefits, continues to be low for the executive Directors relative to other companies in the FTSE 100 Index and market competitive against a broader base of asset management competitors.
In years of strong performance, however, variable compensation, in the form of cash bonuses and deferred bonuses, can be high.
Remuneration report 2007 The remuneration of executive Directors is structured in a manner which reflects performance, at both an individual and Group level, and results in them accumulating rights to shares in the Company and exposure to the performance of Schroders investment funds.
Group policy is not to guarantee compensation levels but to recognise that there will be times when this forms part of the initial package necessary to recruit senior employees.
No executive Director has such a guarantee.
It remains the Committees practice and intention to grant share options sparingly, mainly to assist in recruitment where necessary.
Key developments During the year the Committee considered papers presented on a variety of topics including the following: 2006 and 2007 annual compensation reviews: Impact of age discrimination legislation on the share plans: Changes to the UK defined contribution pension scheme.
The Committee reviewed the existing remuneration policy and, among other factors, considered the guidelines of investor bodies on policies and practices in executive remuneration.
The Committee considered that the Groups reward policy was appropriately aligned to the business strategy and that the policy within the Group was therefore fit for purpose.
No changes were made to the existing policy.
Discussions were initiated on ways of encouraging greater employee share ownership and a longer-term view of performance for senior executives and these discussions are ongoing.
Developments since the last report: In June 2007 the Committee increased the base salaries of the executive Directors.
This is the first increase to the salary of the Chief Executive since his appointment in November 2001 and to the salaries of the other executive Directors since the later of April 2004 and their appointment.
A global review of the pension benefits offered by the Group was undertaken.
The core employer contribution to the Defined Contribution section of the Schroders Retirement Benefit Scheme increased to 14 per cent.
for UK-based employees with effect from 1 March 2008.
Prior to this change, UK-based employees in the Defined Contribution section received a core contribution of 7 per cent.
or an age-related contribution, depending on the date on which their employment started.
Elements of the compensation package Base salary The Committee reviews the base salary of executive Directors annually.
During 2007 the Committee agreed to increases for each of the executive Directors to address market relativities and salary compression accruing with respect to other senior executives.
Details are set out on page 33.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable, with the level of contribution into the UK pension scheme being subject to a notional earnings cap see note 5 on page 61.
Benefits Executive Directors can participate in the flexible benefits plan on the same basis as other UK employees.
Benefits entitlements, including pension, for the executive Directors are shown in the tables on pages 33 and 34.
Remuneration report 28 29 In response to the changes in pensions legislation that came into effect in April 2006 in the Proportions of 2007 fixed and UK, employees who choose not to accrue benefits in the pension scheme apart from life variable compensation for assurance cover receive a taxable cash allowance in lieu.
This allowance is set at a level to each executive Director ensure that the cost impact to the Group including employer National Insurance is neutral.
Michael Dobson Two of the executive Directors are in receipt of such an allowance.
Variable compensation Discretionary bonus awards are delivered in two forms: a cash bonus and a deferred bonus.
Fixed 7% The deferral is mandatory and delivered via the Equity Compensation Plan.
There are two Variable cash bonus 53% types of Equity Compensation Plan award: a share award and a fund award.
These are Variable described more fully on page 30. deferred bonus 40% The bonus awards are determined with regard to the performance of the individual and the area or function of the business in which the individual works or for which the individual is responsible, the profitability of the Group and the external market within the overall limit Jonathan Asquith determined by the ratio of compensation to revenue as explained earlier.
Given that our remuneration structure places a high degree of emphasis on variable compensation, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to set a cap on discretionary bonus awards Fixed 8% at the individual level.
Variable compensation is dependent upon responsibilities, business Variable contribution and individual performance and is not linked to base salary.
As is referred cash bonus 52% to in the section starting on page 14 of the business review dealing with our corporate Variable deferred bonus 40% responsibility, the Committee considered the impact of these factors on our corporate performance when determining the overall reward to the executive Directors.
The Committee can confirm that the discretionary nature of our variable compensation means that senior management are not inadvertently motivated to behave irresponsibly.
Alan Brown Part of the cash bonus award for the senior management of the Group is directly linked to annual improvements in the profitability of the Group.
Fixed 12% The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the total compensation package for Variable each of the executive Directors is shown in the adjacent diagram extracted from the tables cash bonus 57% on pages 33 and 34.

Remuneration report 2007 Equity Compensation Plan 2000 Key employees receive part of their earned bonus in the form of deferred awards under the Equity Compensation Plan on terms designed to align their interests with shareholders and to retain their services in the Group.
The level of mandatory deferral is determined by the Committee in accordance with a matrix that is agreed in advance of the annual compensation review.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement but will vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed within the Group.
This Plan allows deferred awards to be granted in either share awards, fund awards or a combination of both.
At the third anniversary the original grant is increased by 20 per cent.
Share awards Share awards can be granted over either ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares in the Company and are normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
Historically, awards under this Plan were made over non-voting ordinary shares.
As a result of a resolution approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting share awards for 2006 and 2007 are in respect of ordinary shares.
If a participant resigns before the three years have elapsed then the following forfeiture provisions apply as at the date of resignation: Completed years of service from date of award Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 3 Percentage of share award forfeited 100% 72% 44% 0% These awards do not attract dividends.
To the extent that the employee chooses to leave share awards within the Equity Compensation Plan for a further two years after vesting, the employee is rewarded with additional shares of 11.1 per cent.
of the number of shares which vest at the third anniversary.
This compensates for dividends foregone during this period.
A resolution is being proposed at the 2008 Annual General Meeting to enable awards to be adjusted to reflect the dividends paid on shares during the period starting with the fifth anniversary of grant and ending with the date on which the award is exercised.
Fund awards Fund awards are notional investments in a range of Schroders investment funds and can be granted by the Committee as an alternative to share awards.
They give holders a personal interest in the performance of Group funds.
Fund awards have a three-year vesting period, with no option to extend, and have the following forfeiture provisions as at the date of resignation: Completed years of service from date of award Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 3 Percentage of fund award forfeited 100% 66.6% 33.3% 0% These fund awards will be re-valued in line with the performance of the selected products and will be paid out in cash at the end of the deferral period.
In respect of 2007 the first 60,000 of the deferred bonus award was delivered in share awards and any balance, above a minimum level, was generally delivered equally in share awards and fund awards.
Equity Compensation Plan awards are not subject to further performance conditions as they are considered as already having been earned by reference to performance.
Share Option Plan 2000 Under the Share Option Plan 2000, the Company has granted market value share options over non-voting ordinary shares.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years and, for executive Directors, if the performance target has been met at the third anniversary.
Share options granted to other employees have no performance conditions.
In line with market practice, the performance target is that the Companys earnings per share growth defined as the earnings per ordinary share before any items considered exceptional, as derived from the Companys Annual Report and Accounts must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
There is no re-test if the target is not met after three years.
This performance target is a general condition and standard for each executive Director.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP assesses the performance criteria calculations annually for the Committee based on audited results.
Outstanding awards held by executive Directors under these Plans are disclosed in the tables on pages 35 and 36.
This year the value of those awards that are still subject to some degree of forfeiture are disclosed.
Remuneration report 30 31 Employee shares Of the total variable compensation awarded to all employees in the Group in 2007, the proportion that was deferred amounted to 32.1 per cent.
The Share Incentive Plan that was introduced in 2006 for all UK-based employees is also helping to broaden the number of employee shareholders.
Each of the executive Directors and 579 other employees are now members of the Plan representing 51 per cent.
Total employees rights to ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in all of Schroders employee share plans, as a percentage of the total ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in issue, were 6.7 per cent.
Personal shareholding policy In order further to align the interests of the most senior employees with those of shareholders, each of the executive Directors and the other members of the Group Management Committee is required, over time, to acquire and retain a target holding of Schroders shares and or rights to shares, equivalent to 300 per cent.
This target has been achieved for each of the executive Directors.
Despite the recent increase in base salaries for the executive Directors the Committee determined not to alter the shareholding target.
Performance graph The following performance graph shows the Companys total shareholder return performance, comprising share price movements plus the value of dividends reinvested, compared with that of the FTSE 100 Index.
This index was chosen by the Committee because it represents the principal index in which the Companys shares were quoted throughout the majority of the performance period and is still perceived as the most relevant index.
This graph shows the annual percentage change in the value over each financial year of an initial amount invested in Schroders plc on 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2007 compared with the same initial amount invested in each of the companies making up the FTSE 100 Index.

When recruiting executive Directors, the Committees policy is that contracts should not contain any provision for compensation upon early termination and that the parties should rely on employment rights conferred by law.
In the event that compensation for early termination is payable, the Committees policy is to seek to keep such compensation at an appropriate level.
The following table provides details of the current executive Directors service contracts: Notice Notice Nature of period from period from Date of contract s contract Company Director Executive Directors 1 Michael Dobson 19 October 2001 Rolling 12 months 6 months Jonathan Asquith 12 November 2001 Rolling 6 months 6 months Alan Brown 17 May 2005 Rolling 6 months 6 months 27 July 2001 and 2 Massimo Tosato 1 August 2001 Rolling 6 months 6 months Notes 1 If Michael Dobsons employment is terminated by the Company without cause he would be entitled to receive the equivalent of one years compensation, calculated as the annual average of the aggregate of base salary, discretionary cash bonus and awards under the Equity Compensation Plan received in the preceding three years.
