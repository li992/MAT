Unilevers share performance relative to broad-based equity indices The UK Companies Act 1985 schedule 7A requires us to show Unilevers relative share performance, based on Total Shareholder Return, against a holding of shares in a broad-based equity index for the last five years.
The Remuneration Committee has decided to show Unilevers performance against two indices, namely the FTSE 100 Index, London, and the Euronext AEX Index, Amsterdam as these are the most generally used indices in the UK and the Netherlands, where we have our principal listings.

Michael Treschow was appointed a member of the Committee on 6 February 2008.
Advice and assistance The Committee does not formally retain remuneration consultants.
