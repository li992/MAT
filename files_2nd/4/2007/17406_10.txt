Directors Remuneration Report This report sets out the remuneration policy and remuneration details of the executive and non-executive directors of the Group and has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 which incorporates the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and also with the 2006 Combined Code on corporate governance.
The report is divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to shareholders on the audited information and to state whether those sections have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
As required by the Companies Act a resolution for shareholders to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements are presented for approval.
Remuneration Committee unaudited The remuneration committee, which has written terms of reference, determines, on behalf of the Board, the Groups policy on executive remuneration and considers and approves remuneration packages for executive directors.
In addition, the committee monitors and makes recommendations on the level and structure of senior management remuneration across the Group.
The terms of reference are available on the Group website.
The committee, which met four times during the year, comprises three independent non-executive directors, Christopher Stephens as chairman, Marisa Cassoni and Ernest Sheavills.
Where appropriate, the committee consults with the chairman of the Board and the chief executive, neither of whom take part in discussions in matters relating to their own remuneration.
The remuneration committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide independent remuneration advice to the committee.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP has no other relationships with the Company.
The members of the remuneration committee have no personal interest in the outcome of their decisions and give due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the continuing financial and commercial health of the business.
Directors Contracts unaudited Executive Directors The Boards policy is to offer service agreements to executive directors with notice periods of not more than 12 months.
The directors service contracts may be summarised as follows: Director Contract Date Unexpired Term Notice Period Contractual Termination Payments Christopher Cole 01.01.2004 Rolling 1 year 12 months One years remuneration Malcolm Paul 01.01.2004 Rolling 1 year 12 months One years remuneration Stuart McLachlan 01.01.2006 Rolling 1 year 12 months One years remuneration The terms of the service contracts of Christopher Cole and Malcolm Paul allow for liquidated damages that extend beyond basic salaries to include bonuses, which the committee considers reflects the true financial entitlement of the individuals concerned.
Non-Executive Directors The non-executive directors have letters of appointment which provide that their appointments are initially for a term of three years, subject to satisfactory performance and their re-election at forthcoming annual general meetings.
David Turner, who is subject to annual re-election, has a letter of appointment which provides for a one year term, subject to satisfactory performance and re-election at forthcoming annual general meetings.
Their appointments may be terminated with 3 months written notice at any time.
The chairman and non-executive directors dates of appointment and their most recent dates of re-election dates at annual general meetings are set out below: Director Date of appointment as a Date of last re-election at non-executive director annual general meeting David Turner 01.07.1997 01.05.2007 Christopher Stephens 10.01.2003 03.05.2006 Marisa Cassoni 01.01.2006 03.05.2006 Ernest Sheavills 01.01.2006 03.05.2006 Mark Rollins 01.01.2006 03.05.2006 Remuneration Policy unaudited The policy of the Board is to attract, retain and motivate the best executive directors by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages linked to achieving the Groups strategic goals.
The remuneration committee has considered a variety of independently sourced information including comparisons of the executives remuneration with UK peer group companies and 44 WSP Annual Report 2007 UK companies of similar size to WSP.
WSP is an international business and therefore the committee also considered employment practices in companies with a similar international presence.
The committee has considered, and is sensitive to, remuneration and employment conditions throughout the Group.
The remuneration packages of executive directors comprise: Basic salaries that are reviewed annually having regard to individual performance, responsibility and skills, and comparable evidence of other companies in the sector, together with specific employee benefits.
All the executive directors are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
Pension contributions are calculated by reference to basic salaries with neither annual bonuses nor awards under the share incentive schemes taken into account in calculating the amounts due.
Performance related annual bonuses, up to a maximum of 100% of the executive directors salary, are calculated by reference to the Group meeting preset annual diluted earnings per share and, where relevant, profit targets.
Share awards under the 2006 Performance Share Plan, up to a maximum of 100% of the executive directors basic salary.
The vesting of awards is linked to the long-term performance of the Company.
The extent to which an award will vest, and thus becomes exercisable, is measured by reference to the growth in WSPs adjusted diluted earnings per share over the three year performance period.
The committee is of the opinion that adjusted diluted earnings per share continues to be the most appropriate measure of Group performance as it rewards significant and sustained increases in profitability that should be expected to flow through to shareholder value.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is a transparent performance measure within WSP as the Companys approach to revenue recognition is firmly established in accounting practices and cash flow is clearly linked to profit on an annual basis.
In addition, because typically in excess of 40% of the executives who participate in the plan are resident outside the UK, adjusted diluted earnings per share should provide a strong and meaningful focus.
The remuneration committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders by rewarding ongoing performance that creates additional shareholder value.
The performance related elements of executive remuneration which comprise annual bonuses and awards under the 2006 Performance Share Plan are intended to represent a significant proportion of remuneration.
The targeted composition of directors remuneration, assuming full entitlements to bonus and share awards, is set out in the following table.
Director Position Non Performance Related Performance Related David Turner Non-executive Chairman 100% Christopher Cole Chief Executive 40% 60% Malcolm Paul Group Finance Director 40% 60% Stuart McLachlan Executive Director 46% 54% Christopher Stephens Non-executive Director 100% Marisa Cassoni Non-executive Director 100% Mark Rollins Non-executive Director 100% Ernest Sheavills Non-executive Director 100% Bonuses and awards under the 2006 Performance Share Plan are designed to be relevant to the overall objectives of the Group.
The performance targets set by the remuneration committee are reviewed annually and intended to be stretching and reward superior performance in the light of the prevailing economic climate.
The interests of executive directors and shareholders are further aligned by requiring executive directors to build and maintain a minimum shareholding that is linked to their level of remuneration.
Under this policy, it is anticipated that directors will invest a sum at least equivalent to 100 per cent of their salary by investing 50 per cent of their annual after tax bonus, until such time as they establish the requisite holding.
The interests of the directors in the shares of the company are shown on page 49.
The committee has agreed that in the event of a significant adverse event, it may have regard to significant non-financial factors, such as environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and that bonuses may be adjusted downwards on a discretionary basis if such events materially damage the reputation of the Group.
Sustainability factors are further engaged by the 2006 Performance Share Plan which encourages a long term responsible approach to developing the business by rewarding earnings per share growth over three year performance periods.
Non-executive directors fees are determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles of association and are structured to reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of their respective roles.
The non executive directors do not participate in share plans, bonus or pension arrangements.
WSP Annual Report 2007 45 Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance Graph unaudited Set out below is a performance graph that compares the total shareholder return TSR of WSP Group with FTSE 250 and Small Cap TSR indices.
Following the WSP Groups inclusion in the FTSE 250, the Remuneration Committee considers that this index provides a broad UK equity market index against which the TSR performance of WSP Group can be fairly judged and provides a more appropriate basis for comparison than the FTSE Small Cap index which has previously been used.
Total Shareholder Return TSR based on a notional 100 invested in WSP ordinary shares during the 5 year period commencing 1 January 2003 1,800 1,600 1,400 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 01.01.03 31.12.03 31.12.04 31.12.05 31.12.06 31.12.07 WSP TSR FTSE 250 FTSE Small Cap Total shareholder return is the return that shareholders would receive if they acquired a notional number of shares and reinvested dividends on those shares over a period of time.
The graph demonstrates that since the market downturn in 2002, WSP Groups position has strengthened very significantly in relation to the FTSE 250 and FTSE Small Cap indices.
However, during the latter part of 2007, macro economic factors caused a significant weakening in financial markets generally.
Despite WSP Groups improved order book and strong growth in diluted earnings per share that amounted to 39% in 2007, this weakness together with reduced sentiment were reflected in a decline in WSP Groups share price towards the end of 2007 that slowed the Groups TSR growth for the year as a whole.
Directors Remuneration Audited information The following table provides an analysis of the remuneration of each director who served during the year: Salary Performance Employee 2007 2006 2007 2006 Director and fees Bonus Benefits Total Total Pension Pension 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 David Turner 50 50 50 Christopher Cole 330 330 24 684 627 116 109 Malcolm Paul 295 295 23 613 563 103 94 Stuart McLachlan 190 108 13 311 282 19 17 Thomas Ersus resigned 31.08.06 163 45 Christopher Stephens 35 35 35 Marisa Cassoni 35 35 35 Mark Rollins 30 30 30 Ernest Sheavills 30 30 30 995 733 60 1,788 1,815 238 265 Base salary increases in the year amounted to approximately 9% for Christopher Cole and Malcolm Paul and 12% for Stuart McLachlan.
These salary increases reflected the increased responsibilities arising from the continued expansion and increased international focus of the business.
Stuart McLachlans award also reflected his increased competence and experience of holding a main Board position, linked to his appointment to the role at the beginning of 2006.
In setting base salary increases, the committee took account of market data on remuneration levels in competitor companies and pay conditions elsewhere in the Group.
46 WSP Annual Report 2007 In 2007 annual bonus targets required diluted earnings per share to grow by 14.4% during the year at which point an annual bonus of 40% would be payable and this would increase pro rata up to a maximum of 100% if 26.0% growth was achieved.
In 2007, the diluted earnings per share growth was 39.1% and accordingly performance related annual bonuses were payable in full to Malcolm Paul and Christopher Cole.
Stuart McLachlans bonus which amounted to 56.6% of salary was based on a maximum of 75% of salary with a target based on a combination of the Groups diluted earnings per share growth together with the profit growth of the Environment and Energy business.
Employee benefits include a car allowance, together with medical and health insurance cover.
Where executive directors have received approval to serve in a non-executive capacity with other companies, the Board has agreed that they may retain any remuneration received.
During 2007, Christopher Cole received remuneration of 100,000 in his capacity as non-executive chairman of Ashtead Group plc.
Long Term Incentive Share Plan audited information a The WSP Performance Share Plan At 31 December 2007, the committee had made the following awards under WSP Performance Share Plans which are dependent upon the Groups future adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.

No award would have vested unless the Groups adjusted diluted earnings per share over the same period had increased by at least 22.9%, being 4% per annum plus the increase in the Retail Price Index compounded, at which point 25% of any award would have vested.
The adjusted diluted earnings per share as reported in the 2006 Annual Report was 31.0p, representing an actual increase of 112.3% over the base.
As a result of this excellent performance, the awards vested in full and were satisfied by a combination of new issue and market purchased shares.
b The WSP Deferred Bonus Share Plan At 31 December 2007, outstanding awards to directors under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan are set out in the table below.
The last awards under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan were made in April 2006 and the committee has no intention to make further awards under this plan.

In accordance with the Groups accounting policy for employee share schemes, long term incentive compensation arising out of the above plans is disclosed in directors remuneration when they crystallise, which will normally be after the third anniversary of the award, and appropriate provisions are built up over the vesting period.
Where awards under share schemes depend on adjusted 48 WSP Annual Report 2007 diluted earnings per share growth, the committee takes account of the impact of changes in accounting policy, including the changes arising on the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, to ensure that earnings per share are calculated on a consistent basis.
Directors interests unaudited The beneficial and contingent interests of the directors in the 5p ordinary shares of the Company were as follows: Deferred Beneficial Performance Bonus Total Director Shares Share plan Share plan Shares No.
There have been no further changes in directors share interests since 31 December 2007.
