From 2004 onwards, there is no weighting between UK and non-UK companies For cycles beginning in 2004 and 2005, threshold vesting was 40% of the award, and performance ranges for the growth in UEPS were expressed in post-inflation terms.
Threshold vesting is 30% for cycles starting in 2006 and 2007.
Between threshold and maximum vesting the award vests proportionately to the growth in UEPS.
UEPS is a key indicator of corporate performance, and is measured on an absolute basis.
Sustained performance is therefore required over the performance cycle as each year counts in the calculation.
The TSR measure is used for all awards made prior to 2008.
It is measured according to the return index calculated by Datastream on the basis that a companys dividends are invested in the shares of that company.
The return is the percentage increase in each companys index over the performance period.
Threshold vesting is at the 50th percentile ranking relative to the Comparator Group: maximum vesting is at the 80th percentile, and there is a straight line sliding scale between these percentiles.
For cycles beginning in 2004 and 2005, threshold vesting was 40% of the award.
Maximum vesting is 100% for all cycles.

As taxation rates in the US are lower than in the UK, US tax payers are protected from a higher tax burden by means of a tax equalisation programme funded by the Company.
Under this programme, we pay an amount equal to the incremental tax resulting from the assignment of individuals to the UK.
This ensures that they are not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which would result in higher taxation costs than would have been the case if they had remained in their home country.
Due to the nature of taxation payments, some of the amounts shown are in respect of previous financial years which can create distortions when assessing year on year movements.
For all Directors and CEC members, Allowances include flexible benefits and car allowances.
Ken Hannas allowances include an amount equal to 30% of his base salary in lieu of a pension contribution, disability benefits and life cover.
b Other benefits include company cars and, for expatriates, housing support and other allowances necessary to ensure that they are not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which result in higher costs than would have been the case if they had remained in their home country.
c The total AIP award shown was awarded in respect of 2007 performance and invested in the BSRP on 4 March 2008 by Bob Stack and Todd Stitzer.
The AIP and BSRP are described on pages 62 and 63.
The amount shown includes the service related matching award to be awarded under the BSRP to each Director and the aggregate for CEC members.
The performance related conditional matching awards are shown in table six.
d Todd Stitzers and Bob Stacks base salaries are calculated in US dollars as follows: Todd Stitzer US$1,726,000: Bob Stack US$919,000.
