As the Board of Directors is comprised solely of non-executive Directors, it is exempt under the Listing Rules from appointing a Remuneration Committee.
The determination of Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the whole Board.
It is the Companys policy to determine the level of Directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to nonexecutive Directors in the industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfill in respect of Board and Committee responsibilities and the time committed to the Companys affairs.
The Directors attendance at meetings is given on page 21.
