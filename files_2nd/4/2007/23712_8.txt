42 Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007 c Savings-related share schemes To foster a culture of share ownership throughout the Group, the Board operates a Share Save Scheme Share Save and a Share Incentive Plan SIP for all eligible employees.
Both schemes are all-employee share schemes and all employees including Executive Directors who meet certain criteria are eligible to participate.
Invitations to all employees eligible to participate in these schemes are issued following the announcement of the year end results in March.
The SIP is a share scheme that enables employees to purchase F&C shares in a tax efficient manner on a monthly basis at the prevailing market price.
The Share Save is a personal savings scheme that enables employees to either purchase discounted F&C shares, the price of which is determined at the time of offering, at the end of a three-year or five-year saving period, or to receive the accumulated cash value, including accrued interest, on a tax-free basis.
At 31 December 2007, 332 employees 31 December 2006: 321 employees participated in Share Save and 413 employees 31 December 2006: 426 employees participated in the SIP.
Shares under option within Share Save at 31 December 2007 are detailed below: Number of options Term years Exercise price March 2003 Participation 256,474 5 114.0 pence March 2004 Participation 105,332 3 181.0 pence 102,955 5 181.0 pence March 2005 Participation 197,180 3 186.6 pence 122,334 5 186.6 pence March 2006 Participation 238,050 3 171.0 pence 117,033 5 171.0 pence March 2007 Participation 436,163 3 144.3 pence 182,446 5 144.3 pence 290,089 shares 2006: 213,109 shares were held in trust for employees within the SIP.
Both all-employee share schemes seek to buy shares in the market to remove any possible impact of dilution.
d Share incentive schemes The Board believes that the share incentive schemes increase the potential for greater importance to be placed upon the performance related element of total remuneration.
In any 10 year period the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares which will be placed under award under any share incentive scheme, shall not, when aggregated with the number of Ordinary Shares placed under option or issued in that period under any other employees share scheme operated by the Company, exceed 10 per cent.
