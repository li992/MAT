56 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual report on remuneration Implementation of policy for 2016 17 The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that: the Executive Directors are provided with appropriate incentives to align them with the achievement of the Companys strategy and the future creation of shareholder value: enhanced performance is encouraged: and the Executive Directors are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
Base salary The Committee considers it appropriate to increase the base salary for the CEO and CFO for 2016 17 by c. 2%, which is in line with that of the UK employee base: Base salary with effect from CEO CFO 1 April 2015 485,000 300,000 1 April 2016 495,000 306,000 Increase c. 2.1% c. 2.0% Benefits In line with benefits provided for other senior employees, in 2016 17 Executive Directors will continue to be provided with a company car or a mobility allowance, a fuel allowance and a 500 annual allowance towards a range of flexible benefits.
Pension As noted in the Policy Table on page 52, Richard Longdon participated in the AVEVA Solutions Limited defined benefit pension scheme until 2010 when he accrued the maximum benefits that he is entitled to under the scheme.
He is now a deferred member of the scheme and is no longer accruing any further benefits.
James Kidd is a member of the AVEVA Group Personal Pension Plan a defined contribution scheme.
Due to recent changes significantly reducing the annual allowance for pension contributions, the Remuneration Committee, in consultation with our advisers, have decided that it would be appropriate to offer a cash alternative to the extent that the overall cost to the Group of providing this is unchanged.
For2016 17, the Company contribution to the plan of 10% of salary will instead be paid as a cash alternative, with James contributing themaximum amount possible of 10,000 via salary sacrifice.
Annual Incentive Scheme For 2016 17, the maximum opportunity for Executive Directors under the annual incentive will continue to be 125% of base salary whichwill be made up of a core award of 100% of salary and an outperformance award of 25% of base salary.
It has been agreed that for the core award 90% of bonus shall be based on achieving stretching Group adjusted profit before tax PBT targets.
10% of the core award is contingent upon achievement of key individual performance objectives which were agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the financial year.
Of the 90% of the core award based on financial performance, 10% is based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and the remaining 80% is based on the full year results for 2016 17.
The performance targets for the core and outperformance award are based on Group adjusted profit before tax PBT targets and the outperformance award will only be delivered for the achievement of stretch targets over and above the targets for the core award.
The Board believes that, given the annual incentive scheme rewards the achievement of the annual business plan, the targets are market sensitive and therefore should not be disclosed in advance.
Deferral For the core award, at 100% achievement of bonus performance conditions, 60% of the bonus amount is payable in cash and the balance, 40%, is deferred into shares.
If the bonus amount is less than or equal to 70% of the potential maximum core bonus, then 75% of the bonus is paid in cash and 25% paid in deferred shares.
If the bonus amount is between 70% and 100% of the potential maximum core bonus then the proportion paid in deferred shares is determined by linear interpolation between 25% and 40%.
Any outperformance award will be paid in deferred shares.
Deferred awards vest pro-rata over threeyears.

As with previous years, the performance conditions for the award will be based on average adjusted diluted EPS growth over the three-year period from 2015 16 to 2017 18.
However, the Committee has following consultation with major shareholders decided to adjust the EPS performance targets applying to the 2016 awards to bring them into line with the Groups business plan.
Furthermore, given the unpredictability of when the Groups end markets will recover, the Committee has also decided to widen the range to take account of the potential volatility.
The performance ranges for the awards to be granted in 2016 are therefore as follows: Proportion of vesting % of total 1 Performance Targets award Threshold 5% 25% Maximum 15% 100% 1 If average EPS growth is between threshold and maximum then vesting shall be on a straight-line basis.

These salary increases were disclosed and explained in last years report.

58 STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual incentive This reflects the total annual incentive paid and payable in 2016 based on performance in the year ended 31 March 2016.
This includes both the cash element of the bonus and the portion deferred into shares under the deferred share scheme.
The majority of the annual incentive is dependent on achieving Group adjusted profit before tax PBT performance targets.
10% of the core award was dependent on achieving the half year PBT target of 15.0m.
This was a binary target, paying out either nothing or in full.
80% was dependent on full year PBT performance, with nothing paying out if achievement was below 60.8m, and fully paying out if achievement reached 70.4m.
In light of the PBT results, the committee determined that none of the financial element of the core award will be paid.
The Executive Directors were given individual performance objectives which comprise the remaining 10% of the annual incentive.
TheRemuneration Committee have decided that the individual performance element of the annual incentive will pay out in full.
Noneofthe outperformance award will be paid as targets were not met.

These awards were subject to the delivery of EPS growth.
0% of awards vest for diluted adjusted EPS growth of less than 14% p. a. with 100% of awards vesting for diluted adjusted EPS growth of 20% p. a.
Average diluted EPS growth for the three year performance period did not reach the minimum 14% p. a. growth needed and therefore 0% of the LTIP awards will vest in the period relating to 2015 16.
For 2014 15, none of the LTIP awards granted to the Executives in 2012 13 vested as the minimum threshold performance target was notmet.

The UK Group has been chosen because AVEVA is headquartered, and employs around one-quarter of its employees, in the UK.
Typical salary inflation in some other AVEVA locations is materially higher than the UK, which would distort thecomparison.

The committee determined to include adjusted profit before tax in this chart as it is one of the Groups key performance indicators and is the primary measure for the annual incentive scheme.
Outside appointments The Board believes that accepting Non-Executive appointments with other companies enhances the experience of Executive Directors and therefore they are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is sought prior to accepting the appointment.
Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on a case-by-case basis.
Richard Longdon is, since January 2015, Chairman of the Board of Process Systems Enterprise Limited.
Prior to his appointment to this position, the Board considered the impact on his role as CEO and concluded that he could still devote sufficient time to his role and therefore approved his appointment.
Richard Longdon receives fees of 20,000 annually for this role, which, as he performs this role independently of his duties to the Company, the committee determined he was entitled to receive.
