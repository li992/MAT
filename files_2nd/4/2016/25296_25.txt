All incentives are governed by an ANNUAL REPORT overall limit expressed in terms of cash profit.
The table below includes the cost of incentives ON REMUNERATION drawn from the AAP for the financial year under review and the four previous years.
m FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 Cumulative This section reports on remuneration paid during Cash profit 164.9 10.7 339.1 182.6 184.2 860.1 the financial year AAP, being 30% of cash profit 49.5 3.2 101.7 54.8 55.3 258.1 Spend on incentives 29.5 22.1 50.2 48.6 51.5 201.9 Cumulative percentage of cash profit spent 17.9% 33.5% 20.6% 22.3% 23.5% 23.5% The AAP is limited to 30% of cash profit over a rolling five year period.
This percentage may be exceeded in any year but must not be exceeded on an aggregate average basis over five years.
Managing the AAP by reference to a five year rolling average is a shareholder protection to ensure that variable awards to employees are made in a considered long term way rather than as a sharp reaction to a single years performance.
Realised cash profits are significantly driven by the realisation of investments, which is unpredictable and often beyond the Companys direct control.
In a strong profit year such as FY14, the Committee may choose not to distribute the full AAP, but can instead choose to retain some of it for use in future years, while in a lower profit year the Committee may choose to distribute some of the retained AAP.
This approach allows the Committee to plan over multiple years and smooth fluctuations in realisations.
In strong profit years the Committee is not compelled to make awards which may be excessive, while in years with a lower cash profit and or no investment realisations, staff can still be appropriately incentivised to protect the long term interests of the business and mitigate the risk of undesirable loss of talent.
In both cases due regard is given to projected results of future periods and to ongoing management and retention of employees.
The amounts awarded therefore may not fully correlate to annual variations in cash profit, but this reflects the multi-year approach taken by the Committee.
The Committee is mindful each year of the appropriate level of compensation to ensure the retention of staff at all levels, and seeks to ensure that staff are rewarded against appropriate benchmarks.
Due to the protection of the AAP being set at a 30% rolling average with regard to performance over a multi-year period, the Remuneration Committee does not feel that formal upper limits on remuneration payable to Executive Directors are required.
Within the AAP limit, the Remuneration Committee must appropriately reward all staff, and has regard to the balance between Executive Directors and other employees.
The need to remunerate all staff from this pool in a way that will attract and retain talent acts as a natural and inbuilt ceiling on how much the Executive Directors may be awarded: however, as the AAP itself varies each year in an unpredictable manner depending on performance, it is not appropriate to set limits on awards to Executive Directors before the results of their performance are known.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS An Executive Directors annual incentive award is governed by the size of the AAP and their individual performance as determined by the annual appraisal process.
At the beginning of the financial year under review, the Company assigned the Executive Directors a number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs broadly in the areas of fundraising and growth, investment portfolio performance, operational and risk management measures, performance management and financial performance.
84 85 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT REPORT STATEMENTS LINK TO STRATEGY 1 Grow assets under management 2 Invest selectively 3 Manage portfolios to maximise value EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR A summary of the KPIs, and the Executive Directors performance against these objectives is set out below: Link to Performance Strategic KPI Objectives Weighting Target Underperforming Performing Outperforming Narrative Long Term Fundraising 15% 4bn p. a.

Target adjusted ROE 10% 13% following Adjusted ROE of 12.9% exceeded the target 3 any return of 11.7%, will increase materially following the of capital proposed capital return in July and exceed the 13% target.
In addition to the above KPIs, each Executive Director is also measured against the effective application of commercially appropriate risk management practices, metrics and controls.
In some years, some strategic initiatives may be too sensitive to be disclosed as KPIs.
It is the intention of the Committee that these will be retrospectively disclosed in future years once they are less sensitive.
There were no such KPIs in this year.
Performance against KPIs is first assessed for the Executive Directors as a group, to recognise the collaborative leadership structure and joint decision making of the Executive Committee.
This ensures that all Executive Directors are aligned with, and jointly responsible for, the Groups strategic direction and key decision making.
This year, the Committee was of the view that there has been strong performance against a number of the KPIs, with fundraising above long term target levels and highly satisfactory deployment of our funds.
Cash profits are in line with last year and we are seeing good growth in fund management profits.
We have also taken some major steps to improve balance sheet efficiency, leading to further capital distributions to shareholders.
The Committee also noted the short term fundraising target was not met.
All of these factors were considered in setting the core amount of the awards to all Executive Directors.
Once Group performance has been assessed against the KPIs and a base level for awards adjusted according to the individuals role within the organisation is established, the Remuneration Committee may make individual adjustments upwards or downwards to reflect an individual Executive Directors performance during the year.
The Remuneration Committee considered carefully whether any individual adjustments were required.
The Committee noted that the level of capital raised was above the long term objective but fell slightly below the short term target set for FY16: this has been reflected in the awards made to Christophe Evain and Benot Durteste.
The good performance in terms of fund deployment was also reflected in these awards.
Benot Durtestes remuneration in the current financial year is materially lower than the prior year when he led an area of work which had a significant impact on the financial performance of the Group: the sale of the assets of European Fund IV 2006.
The FY16 award to Philip Keller has increased compared to the prior financial year when a downward adjustment was made in the light of a technical breach in our regulatory disclosures as identified in last years Audit Committee report.
This has been satisfactorily addressed and there has also been strong progress in our infrastructure functions and improvements in the efficiency of our financial structure.
During the year, the Group has enhanced its resources and procedures in the areas of compliance and risk management, embedding risk management and control further into our day to day activities.
This has been shown by the recruitment of a CRO and his enhancement of our risk processes see pages 28 to 29 : and by the appointment of two new professionals for the Compliance function.
The Executive Directors KPIs for FY17 have been set in the same categories as those disclosed above.
The specific targets are not disclosed due to commercial sensitivity but will be disclosed in next years Annual Report.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE In the financial year under review, in line with the Directors remuneration policy, the base salary payable to each Executive Director has been increased to 369,000 per annum from 360,000 per annum, a 2.5% increase.
The percentage increase received is in line with other employees.
86 87 STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT REPORT STATEMENTS HOW DO WE BENCHMARK OUR COMPENSATION?
Remuneration awards are benchmarked against the following peers in the major jurisdictions where the Group operates: Listed financial service companies Listed Private Equity firms Investment banks Listed asset managers Unlisted asset managers Unlisted Private Equity firms Other organisations as appropriate for the individual role The Groups Human Resources team carries out an extensive annual exercise to benchmark proposed salaries and deferred awards for all employees.
This exercise covers employees at all levels and in all geographies and provides an assessment which shows how a particular employee is remunerated compared to the market in their particular field.
Executive Director compensation is heavily benchmarked against a range of peers and the available data set has been discussed regularly by the Remuneration Committee see page 73.
The benchmarking exercise draws on a wide variety of sources including information from recognised independent market data providers, our own insight from dealing with recruitment consultants and other advisers, experience from our own recruitment and staff turnover and our understanding of market competitors.
Due to the unique nature of the Groups business as a listed entity which competes for talent against other asset managers and listed and unlisted private equity employers as well as investment banks, it is necessary to obtain a wide range of comparison sets.
Hence, while we do consider other listed financial service companies in our benchmarking, they are not the only relevant comparator.

ICG ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 CHAIRMANS BOARD OF CORPORATE COMMITTEE REMUNERATION DIRECTORS LETTER DIRECTORS GOVERNANCE REPORTS REPORT REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED BALANCE SHEET CARRY AWARDS It is not possible to accurately value Balance Sheet Carry which is awarded to individuals, as the value of awards will depend on performance over a multi-year period and, if a hurdle is not met, awards may never have any value.
Amounts actually received under Balance Sheet Carry awards are disclosed in the single figure table under Long Term Incentives in the year in which they arise see page 86.
However, to allow budgeting and management of allocations from the AAP, an internal assumption is made as to the potential investment performance of balance sheet investments at a money multiple of 1.5 times.
Despite the uncertainty of both the value and timing of this return, no risk weighted discount is applied.
While the actual outcome will inevitably be different, the below table shows the notional value of Balance Sheet Carry that were allocated from the AAP for awards made to Executive Directors during the financial year.
This is not included within the Single Figure Table.

PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION OF DIRECTOR UNDERTAKING THE ROLE OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE The table below details how changes to the CEOs pay compare with the change in the average pay across all employees of the Group.
Each figure is a percentage change of the values between the previous financial year and the financial year under review.
The total permanent workforce has been selected as the comparator for salaries and fees and short term incentives.
The comparison of the increase in taxable benefits has been made for UK permanent employees only as their remuneration packages are most similar to that of the Chief Executive.
Salaries and fees Taxable benefits Short term incentives Chief Executive Officer 1.63% -8.94% -5.6% All employees 3.68% -0.96% 4.5% RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF SPEND ON PAY The graph below illustrates the relative importance of spend on pay compared with other disbursements from profit namely distributions to shareholders for the financial year under review and the previous financial year.
The current year shareholder distributions include a proposed special dividend of 200m which the Group announced with its 2016 results.
A special dividend of 300m was paid in July 2015 and consequently shareholder distributions in the current financial year have fallen.
The movement in staff costs reflects the increased headcount supporting the growth of the Group.

In particular, the fee to the Chairman was below the benchmark for companies of our size and sector and so this has been increased.
The fee to the Chairman now includes membership of the Risk and Remuneration Committees: in prior years, there have been separate fees payable for these memberships.
The fees payable for Committee memberships and to the Senior Independent Director have not been increased since 2011 despite significant increases in the workload of the Committees and the corporate governance role of the SID.
An increase has therefore been made for these roles.
No fee is paid for membership of the Nominations Committee or to the Chairman of that Committee.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Peter Gibbs Chairman, Justin Dowley, Kevin Parry and Kim Wahl.
During the year, the Committee was advised by PwC.
Committee composition is set out on pages 42 to 43 and in the relevant Committee reports on pages 51 to 93.
For FY17, the AAP will be calculated as a percentage of cash profits which, over a period of five years, will not exceed 30% on average.
The AAP will be calculated as described in the Directors remuneration policy.
All incentives excluding Third Party Carry and similar arrangements in respect of business acquisitions or ICG direct investment funds that do not give rise to a cost or liability to the Group payable to employees of the Group will be funded out of the AAP.
The Executive Directors annual bonus and other incentives will be dependent on them achieving specific objectives as set out on page 85.
