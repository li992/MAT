DIRECTORS SERVICE CONTRACTS The companys policy is to employ executive directors on service agreements which are terminable on 12 months notice.

With the exception of Sir Patrick Sergeant, none of the non-executive directors has a service contract, although JC Botts, DP Pritchard, TP Hillgarth and ART Ballingal serve under a letter of appointment.
The service contract of Sir Patrick Sergeant provides for 12 months expense allowance and an expense allowance up to the date of termination in the event of incapacity.
The directors service contracts are available for shareholder inspection at the companys registered ofce.
