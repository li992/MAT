Dividend equivalents will be earned on deferred shares during the deferral period.
A clawback provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to recover all elements of bonus.
A malus provision is operated that gives the Remuneration Committee the right to reduce any deferred bonus awards which have not yet vested in relation to circumstances of corporate failure, which may have occurred at any time before malus is operated.
Each Executive Director is required to hold the net number of shares acquired through the deferred bonus plan and LEAP until the value of their total shareholding is equal to their annual salary.
For 2016, the values of each Executive Directors annual bonus paid in cash and deferred into shares were as follows: Total annual bonus shown in column c of single figure remuneration table on page 66 in Cash payment Deferred into shares respect of2016 Richard Howson 122,612 122,612 245,224 Richard Adam 139,932 139,932 Summary of 2017 bonus operation The bonus will operate unchanged for 2017 based on a balanced scorecard of EPS, cash, corporate strategic KPIs 75 per cent and individual objectives 25 per cent.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity remains at 100 per cent of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the actual annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive as they provide our competitors with insight into our business plans, expectations and our strategic actions and should therefore remain confidential to the Company.
However, the Remuneration Committee will continue to disclose how bonuses paid relate to performance against targets on a retrospective basis.
The performance measures for the 2017 bonus will be as follows: Weighting EPS 30% Cash conversion 20% Corporate quantitative KPIs to include net debt, safety, customers and people 25% Individual objectives 25% Value earned from long-term incentive awards The Leadership Equity Award Plan LEAP For the LEAP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2014, 50 per cent of salary was based on growth in earnings per share, 50 per cent of salary was based on average annual cash flow conversion and 50 per cent of salary was based on strategic performance targets as shown below.

The average annual cash flow conversion is calculated as the underlying cash flow from operations divided by the underlying profit from operations as reported in the Annual Report and Accounts.
Annual cash flow conversion over the three-year performance period is averaged to provide a focus on the sustainable delivery of cash-backed profits.
Strategic performance metrics are aligned to the Companys sustainability agenda and drive shareholder value.
The following three metrics applied equally: Delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-saving and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 25 million, 30 million and 32 million in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
Performance over the period was 97.1 million and exceeded the maximum: and Delivery of employee engagement in sustainability measured through a target of 25 per cent of Carillions employees undertaking community work in Company time by the end of 2016.
Performance over the period was 30 per cent and exceeded the maximum: and Strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a book-to-bill ratio of more than one.
This is measured on a sliding scale between 80 per cent and 120 per cent of target and an average of 98 per cent was achieved resulting in the payment of five per cent of the opportunity.

For 2016, this is based on two quantifiable and stretching strategic measures that apply equally: delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-savings and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 108 million over the performance period: and strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a book-to-bill ratio of between 80 per cent and 120 per cent.
Vesting under each strategic element will be based on an audited assessment of performance that will be provided to the Remuneration Committee.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the vesting reflects the underlying performance of Carillion and retains the flexibility to adjust the vesting amount to ensure it remains appropriate.
It is often not possible to assess this formulaically and any adjustment will depend on the nature, timing and materiality of any contributory factors.
In order to maintain transparency, the Remuneration Committee will disclose how the Company has performed against each of the strategic metrics at the end of the performance period and will disclose any adjustments made to ensure that vesting appropriately reflects the underlying performance of the business.
Executive Directors are required to retain their vested shares for a further two-year period after the end of the three-year performance period.
Long-term incentive awards for 2017 No changes are proposed to the maximum LEAP opportunity for 2017 and this will therefore remain at 150 per cent of salary and the proportion of the award vesting for threshold performance remains at 25 per cent of salary.
Two-thirds of the LEAP award up to 100 per cent of salary will continue to be subject to EPS and cash flow conversion performance targets, as set out above, and one-third up to 50 per cent of salary will be based on two quantifiable and stretching strategic measures that will apply equally: delivery of sustainability through measurable cost-saving and efficiencies that will provide contributions to the Companys profit of 114 million over the performance period: and strategic growth measured through the achievement of secured and probable, profitable new orders over the performance period with a book-to-bill ratio of between 80 per cent and 120 per cent.

The Remuneration Committee consists exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors Alison Horner, Ceri Powell, Andrew Dougal and Keith Cochrane.
Its terms of reference can be found on the Companys website, www.
The Remuneration Committee determines the policy for remuneration of key members of the senior management team.

The Group Chief Executive is consulted on the remuneration of those who report directly to him and also of other senior executives.
No Executive Director or employee is present or takes part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses Deloitte LLP to provide salary survey and benchmarking information and external and internal contextual information and analysis as required.
The Remuneration Committee took into account the Remuneration Consultants Groups Code of Conduct when reviewing the ongoing appointment of Deloitte as adviser to the Remuneration Committee.
Deloittes fees for providing such advice are charged on a time basis and amounted to 25,320 for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: 44,950.
The Remuneration Committee assesses from time to time whether this appointment remains appropriate or should be put out to tender.
The Remuneration Committee undertook such an assessment during the year and remains satisfied with Deloittes appointment as advisers to the Remuneration Committee.
Deloitte, which was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2005, also provides certain specialist consultancy services and internal audit services, but otherwise has no other connections with the Group.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte is objective and independent.
The Remuneration Committee adopts the principles of good governance as set out in the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended.

The new policy set out below will, subject to shareholder approval, apply from the end of the 2017 AGM.
No significant changes have been made to the policy approved at the 2014 AGM.
However, certain minor amendments have been made to take account of developments since the 2014 AGM and to ensure the policy is appropriate for the Company going forwards.
In summary the changes made to the proposed policy as compared to the policy approved at the 2014 AGM are as follows: Minimum shareholding guidelines: In line with best practice, the minimum shareholding guidelines are included in the Policy and reflect our current target of 100 per cent of salary.
Holding period: A two-year holding period was introduced into LEAP for awards made in 2015 and beyond and this has been formally included as part of the 2017 Policy.
Pension: Has been simplified and the value of the pension provision reduced for new Executive Directors appointed after 5 April 2016 so that the maximum pension allowance or cash equivalent that can be made is 25 per cent of salary.
Annual bonus: The maximum annual bonus that can be earned has been maintained at 100 per cent of salary but have emphasised that 75 per cent of the bonus will be determined based on the achievement of financial and quantitative measures.
Non-Executive Directors: We have not changed our approach to Non-Executive Directors fees.
However, to reflect current practice, we have included an express reference to our ability to provide benefits such as secretarial support and the reimbursement of travel expenses.

A number of methods are common across the Group People Forums, Leadership conference calls, Team Talks, Performance Development Reviews, Job Chats, Your Say and Chief Executives Leadership Team Lunches and a number are business or area specific newsletters, consultation groups and socials.
The Board receives updates and feedback on employee engagement.
