An annual review of Executive Directors salaries is undertaken in September along with all employees.
This allows us to optimise the link between performance and reward for all employees.
Ian Pages salary has not been increased since January 2014, and as part of the annual review we will consider whether any increase should be made to reflect the exceptional change in size and complexity of the Group since that date.
It is our expectation that any increase to Tony Griffins salary will be in line with the range of increases for the wider workforce.
