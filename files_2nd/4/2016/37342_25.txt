REMUNERATION Simon Palley, Chairman, Remuneration Committee COMMITTEES ANNUAL STATEMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS Simon Palley Chairman Dame Alison Carnwath Chris Bartram to 23 July 2015 Edward Bonham Carter Cressida Hogg CBE from 23 July 2015 Independent Non-executive Director Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for 2015 16.
Last years revisions to our remuneration arrangements, most notably the changes to our Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for Executive Directors, were approved by 99% of shareholders in July following extensive consultation.
Since then, the remainder of 2015 16 has been a more routine year for the Remuneration Committee.
Within the business, we have seen consistently high levels of activity across all areas of the portfolio as we complete the leasing of our well timed London development programme and the transformation of our Retail Portfolio.
The results for the year are strong, although our share price has been impacted by wider economic and political uncertainty.
The majority of our performance targets arerelative, aiming to achieve a higher Total Shareholder Return TSR and Total Property Return TPR than both our listed peers and other investors operating in our market.
This means that in a year where profits are low or losses are recorded, the outturns for variable pay can be high where outperformance has been significant.
It also means that in a year when profits are high, but we have underperformed our benchmarks, the outturns from our variable pay can be low.

Remuneration outcomes for Directors during the year In this section, we explain the pay outcomes for Directors in relation to the financial year ended 31 March 2016.
Table 25 shows the payments we expect to make and then tables 27 and 28 give more detail on how we have measured the performance outcomes with respect to the annual bonus and LTIP in the context of value created for shareholders.
1.1 Directors emoluments Audited The basis of disclosure in the table below is on an accruals basis.
This means that the annual bonus column includes the amount that will be paid inJune 2016 in connection with performance achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2016.
It should be noted that the annual bonus figure has been estimated for the purposes of the tables, as final data on the Companys Total Property Return versus the peer group using the new benchmark all March-valued properties will not be available until after the date of this Reports publication.
The estimate has been derived from the most up-to-date performance information available, and any payment made will bebased on the final performance data when received and verified.
The values shown for the 2013 LTIP awards vesting for the three year performance period ended 31 March 2016 are based on achievement against the relative performance measures and calculated using the average share price for the quarter then ended.
The actual share price is not known at the time of writing as the awards do not formally vest until July 2016.
Basic salary is stated as a per annum figure based on current salary.
Actual salaries in the year were 746,487 Robert Noel and 488,946 Martin Greenslade.
Benefits consist of a car allowance, private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance premiums.
The pension allowance shown is a cash emolument of 25% of base salary.
The long-term incentives for 2015 16 have been calculated using a share price of 10.67 which is the three month average to 31 March 2016.
The long-term incentives vesting in 2014 15 were estimated in last years report, so have been adjusted to reflect actual values.
The impact of the adjustment was 91,000 for Robert Noel and 61,000 for Martin Greenslade.

Awards granted in 2013 under the LTIP for this period are subject to performance conditions that measure and compare the Groups relative performance against its peers in terms of Total Property Return TPR and Total Shareholder Return TSR, with each measure representing 50% of the total award.
Please see table 39 on page 80 for more detail on how vesting levels are determined.
The performance calculation for awards granted in 2013 and vesting in 2016 are illustrated below: LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AND MATCHING SHARE PLAN OUTTURNS Unaudited Table 28 Outturn Target Percentage of base salary maximum Assessment Percentage of maximum 1 Ungeared Total Property Return 75 75 maximum shares Land Securities Total Property Return per annum over the three 13.1 pledged year period was 15.9%, compared with the performance of the sector-weighted IPD Quarterly Universe index of 15.8%.

Total Shareholder Return 75 75 maximum shares Land Securities Total Shareholder Return over the three year 0.0 pledged period was 40.8% versus that of the comparator group see below which was 45.3%.

The outturn is adjusted to take account of the performance of trading properties and the capital and income extracted from Queen Annes Gate, SW1, through a bond issued in 2009.
In total, therefore, 13.1% of the awards made in 2013, will vest in July 2016.
For awards granted in 2014, the Groups performance over the two years to 31 March 2016 would, if sustained over the three year period to 31March 2017, result in 47.7% of the LTIP share awards vesting.
For awards granted in 2015, performance over the one year period to 31 March 2016 would, if sustained over the second and third years of the period to 31 March 2018, result in 21.4% of the LTIP share awards vesting.

Directors Remuneration for 2016 17 3.1 Executive Directors base salaries Last year, the Committee undertook a peer group benchmarking exercise in respect of the salaries payable to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.
The benchmarking analysis was conducted in consultation with the Committees independent remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street, and resulted in a total increase of 6% including an inflationary increase for Robert Noels salary, reflecting three years of strong performance in the role.
This recommendation formed part of the new remuneration arrangements upon which we consulted with shareholders in 2015.
After reviewing the data for the Chief Financial Officer, the Committee concluded that no additional increase was necessary for Martin Greenslade, and that he should receive an inflationary uplift of 2% to his base salary.
As anticipated, the Committee concluded that no benchmarking exercise was necessary this year and has awarded both Executive Directors a base salary increase of 2%.
This is in line with the average increase received by employees across the Group, excluding promotions and exceptional increases.
Accordingly, the following salary increases will take effect from 1 June 2016: EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Unaudited Table 37 Average % From increase over five Current 1 June 2016 years including Name 000 000 % increase 2016 17 Robert Noel 754 769 2.0 3.3 Martin Greenslade 491 500 2.0 3.0 1.

3.2 Non-executive Directors fees In December 2015, and following a market benchmarking review last conducted in September 2013, the Board increased the fees for Non-executive Directors as shown in the table below.
In reaching its decision, the Board took into account data from several published surveys and insights on trends in non-executive pay provided by our independent remuneration advisors and other external providers.
We believe that these market competitive rates will enable Land Securities to continue to attract Non-executive Directors of the highest calibre, and recognise the significant time commitment given.
As stated in the Policy, the next review of Non-executive Director fees is likely to take place in two to three years time.
