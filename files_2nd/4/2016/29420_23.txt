Strategic Financial Report Governance Statements Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Directors Remuneration Report Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee With only modest changes, our current Remuneration Policy effectively supports the Groups strategic goals and I commend it to shareholders.
Russell King Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the 2016 Directors RemunerationReport.
Executive Directors base salary Remuneration Policy and total package continue to be Our Remuneration Policy falls for approval at the 2017 AGM and, in this context, the Committee has considered whether set modestly, below the median thecurrent remuneration framework effectively supports thedelivery of the Groups strategic goals and creation of UK quoted companies of ofshareholder value.
We considered a range of potential comparable size.
approaches, but as the current Policy works well are only proposing very modest changes.
In summary: Performance Share Plan PSP awards to Executive Directors will now be subject to an additional two-year holding period following thethree-year vesting point, during which awards will not beexercisable and will remain available for malus clawback.
Dividend entitlements for vested awards will continue to accrue during the holding period.
A separate resolution willbeput to the 2017 AGM to extend the life of the PSP forafurther ten years and to incorporate these holding periodchanges.
No changes are presently proposed to the current PSP performance measures one-third each on Earnings Per Share EPS, Economic Profit EP and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
However, the various performance scales are more demanding than the market norms and the size of grant is set modestly, below median.
Therefore, we are proposing that the EPS growth range for new awards be reduced from CPI 5-13% p. a. to CPI 5-11% p. a.

We are, however, conscious that grants maturing in March 2018 are also unlikely to vest on the significant increases were necessary in 2014 to address a EPS, TSR or EP measures.
The grants made in March 2016 are market misalignment and are keen that this should not occur too early in their three-year performance period for the again.

Notes 1 Stating maximum amounts for the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The regulations governing directors remuneration reports and related investor guidance encourage companies to disclose a cap within which each element of remuneration policy will operate.
Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the Directors Remuneration Policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
2 Rationale for performance measures chosen: Annual bonus the performance conditions used to determine bonus achievement are selected by the Committee with the emphasis on driving growth in annual adjusted profit before tax and aspiring to meet or exceed stretching targets, to the benefit of shareholders.
The remaining bonus component aims to reward the achievement of significant and demanding personal performance objectives.
PSP the rationale for the EPS, TSR and EP performance measures that will apply to PSP awards to be made in 2017 is that these performance measures promote an appropriate balance between absolute financial performance, strong relative performance and the efficient application of capital resources in generating profits.
3 Differences between the policy on remuneration for Directors from the policy on remuneration for other employees.
Where the Companys pay policy for the Executive Directors differs from its pay policies for groups of employees, this reflects the appropriate market rate position for the relevant roles.

5 Discretions reserved in operating incentive plans.
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules and the above Directors Remuneration Policy table.
The Committee reserves certain discretions, consistent with market practice, in relation to the operation and administration of these plans including: as described in the above table the determination of performance measures and targets and resultant vesting and pay-out levels: as described in the above table the ability to adjust performance measures and targets to reflect events and or to ensure that the performance measures and targets operate as originally intended: as described in the Termination arrangements section on page 81 determination of the treatment of individuals who leave employment, based on the rules of the incentive plans, and the application of the incentive plans under exceptional events, such as a change of control of the Company: and the ability to make adjustments to existing awards made under the incentive plans in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructurings or special dividends.

Ignoring any one-off buy-out arrangements which may prove to be necessary, the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements will operate including the maximum award levels as detailed in the general policy in relation to any newly-appointed Executive Director.

For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as it considers appropriate.
