This payment is to be made in equal monthly instalments with any remuneration received during the 12 months following the Termination Date being offset against the monthly amount being paid to him by the Company.
Chris has found alternative employment, which commenced on 4 April 2016.
His salary and benefits at Northgate as at the Termination Date equated to 324,875 per annum.
His new salary and benefits equate to 307,346 per annum.
The difference of 17,529 per annum will be paid to Chris in equal monthly instalments of 1,460.75 over the next 12 months.
Chris was also paid an additional amount of 2,669.88 in respect of the first three days of April 2016 before he started his alternative employment.
The total amount paid in this financial year after he ceased to be a Director was therefore 4,130.63.
Paddy Gallagher was appointed to the Board on 22 February 2016 at a basic salary of 325,000 per annum.
His maximum annual bonus potential is 100% of basic salary and his maximum annual award level under the EPSP is 150% of salary.
There was no buyout of incentive arrangements from his previous employer.
Annual bonus for the year ended 30 April 2016 Deferred annual bonus plan The bonus for the executive Directors in respect of the year under review was based as to 75% on Group PBT and 25% on strategic objectives, with a ROCE underpin of 11.97% being 95% of budget, below which no bonus would be payable.
ROCE on the above basis was 12.2% for the year ended 30 April 2016.
The maximum potential bonus for the CEO was 150% of basic salary but with a stretch performance target to achieve that level of bonus.
The maximum potential bonus for the CFO was 100% of basic salary.
For the CEO, the bonus is paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares up to 100% of salary.
Any bonus earned in excess of this is paid wholly in shares.
For the CFO the bonus is paid 50% in cash and 50% in shares.
The shares are deferred for three years, subject to continued employment.
Both the cash and share elements are subject to clawback, further details of which are given on page 73.
The matrix of target PBT levels and the percentage of the maximum available for this element was as follows: Lower Plan Upper CEO stretch Target PBT - m 82.7 87.1 91.0 92.8 CEO 25% 62.5% 125% 150% CFO 25% 50% 100% Group PBT for the year was 82.9m.
The Committee set the CEO objectives on management restructuring, development of customer proposition and improvement to NPS, new site performance and a future European Strategy.
On assessment by the Committee against these objectives it was felt that, whilst good progress had been made in relation to embedding a new senior management team in the UK, improvements to NPS and setting a European strategy, the performance of new sites was not yet at a satisfactory level.
As a result, the Committee determined that 56.25% out of the 25% available for this part of the bonus had been achieved.
The CFOs objectives were centred on debt restructuring, cyber risk mitigation, IT strategy project review and improvements to year end processes.
The Committee assessed his performance and felt that the CFO had fully achieved all his objectives.
The resulting bonuses for 2016 were as follows: Strategic Maximum Achievement Cash Shares PBT objectives Total 000 000 000 000 RL Contreras 20.0% 14.1% 34.1% 612 209 104.5 104.5 2 CJR Muir 19.6% 25.0% 44.6% 234 104 52 52 1 2 PJ Gallagher 26.1% 26.1% 61 16 8 8 1 Given his start date, it was not felt appropriate to set strategic objectives for Paddy Gallagher, so his bonus was based purely on the PBT measure.
2 The bonuses payable to Chris Muir and Paddy Gallagher were pro-rated for time to reflect their periods of service with the Company Chris Muir from 1 May 2015 to 31 March 2016 and Paddy Gallagher from 22 February 2016 to 30 April 2016.
