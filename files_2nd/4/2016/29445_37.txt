This comprises the total remuneration received over the full year from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016.
2 Rob Roger stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and left the Company on 30 June 2016.
3 T he 2014 LTIP award is due to vest during 2017.
For the purpose of the single figure table, the value of shares forecast to vest including dividend equivalents have been valued based on the average share price over the final quarter of 2016 of 3.634.
4 I n accordance with the requirements of the disclosure regulations, the value of the Directors Share Bonus Plan Award vesting in 2016 is calculated based on the share price at the date of vesting of 3.196 after part of the performance criteria for the second tranche of this award was met, inclusive of accrued dividends.
Further details on the exercise of awards under the Directors Share Bonus Plan can be found on page 86.
Additional notes to the table Salary Simon Gordons salary was increased from 350,000 to 367,500 per annum on 1 April 2016.
Andrew Whites salary on appointment as an Executive Director on 1 July 2016 was 365,000 per annum.
Benefits The benefits consist of private medical insurance for the Executive Directors and their families, life assurance, income protection cover and a car allowance.
Retirement benefits The amount set out in the table represents the Group contribution to the Executive Directors retirement planning at a rate of 18% of base salary.
Simon Gordon is a member of the Spire Healthcare Pension Plan.
Amounts above the HMRC annual allowance are paid as taxable cash supplements.
Annual bonus For the 2016 financial year, the maximum bonus opportunity for Andrew White and Simon Gordon was 150% of base salary.
The annual bonus targets were set at the beginning of the financial year, with 70% of the award being assessed against EBITDA and 30% assessed against a balanced scorecard based on strategic targets including productivity, customer, quality and staff measures.
The threshold EBITDA target for 2016 was set at 164.0 million and no bonus would be payable if this threshold was not achieved.
Although the Companys performance remained reasonable during the year, a number of internal and external factors impacted the business, meaning that it did not achieve the minimum EBITDA threshold of 164.0 million.
Although both Executive Directors largely met their individual objectives under the balanced scorecard, the Committee determined that no bonus will be paid in respect of 2016.
Departure terms for Rob Roger As announced in March 2016, Rob Roger stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2016 after more than nine years with the business.
On departure, Rob Roger did not receive any cash termination payment or payment in lieu of notice.
His outstanding LTIP awards lapsed on departure.
He did not receive a bonus in respect of the time working during 2016.
The Committee determined that he would retain his outstanding award over 18,057 shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan which is due to vest in 2018, as this relates to performance in 2014.
Awards under the Directors Share Bonus Plan were treated in accordance with the plan rules and vested in line with other participants and further details are shown on page 86.
84 Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, one-third of the Executive Directors annual bonus is deferred for three years.
No award was made under the DBP in 2016.
The following award over shares was granted under the DBP in 2015 and relates to the 2014 bonus which was disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts: Type of award Date of award Shares awarded Shares exercisable Simon Gordon Conditional Share Award 1 June 2015 10,922 1 June 2018 to 1 June 2025 in the form of nil-cost options The share price used to determine the number of deferred shares subject to award was 3.606, the mid-market closing share price on 29 May 2015.
Awards are deferred for a period of three years and are conditional on continued employment.
There are no further performance conditions attaching to these shares although they remain subject to a malus provision.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The performance period for awards granted in 2014 ended on 31 December 2016.
This award was based on targets linked to EPS and relative TSR performance.
Half of the award was based on TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
Threshold vesting 25% of the element required median performance, with outperformance of the upper quartile required for full vesting.
Over the period to 31 December 2016, the Company delivered a total shareholder return of 76%.
This was well within the upper quartile of the comparator group, and therefore this element of the award is due to vest in full.
The remaining half of the award was based on EPS targets.
The 2016 EPS was below the threshold of 20.6 pence, and therefore this element of the award will lapse.
This award will vest during 2017.
For the purpose of the single figure table, the value of shares forecast to vest including accrued dividends is based on the average share price over the final quarter of 2016.
Awards under the LTIP were granted on 30 March 2016.
These awards were granted in the form of nil-cost options over Spire Healthcare Group plc shares, with the number of shares that may vest conditional on performance over the three-year period to 31 December 2018.
The maximum award granted to Executive Directors except for the Executive Chairman who does not receive an award under the terms of his remuneration package was equivalent to 200% of base salary.
The Committee determined that awards under this plan should be linked to the value created for shareholders over the period, and as a consequence that the awards should continue to be equally weighted as to EPS and relative TSR performance targets.
Further details of the performance conditions applying to the 2016 awards are set out below.

Spire Healthcare Group plc Annual Report 2016 85 GOVERNANCE: DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Legacy arrangement relating to the period prior to Admission Directors Share Bonus Plan Awards As disclosed in the Prospectus, the Directors Share Bonus Plan Awards are legacy arrangements that were adopted and operated prior to Admission.
These figures have been included in the single-figure table above in the interests of transparency: however, it should be noted that they relate to performance delivered prior to Admission.
Awards were granted to Simon Gordon, Rob Roger and Garry Watts in recognition of his performance in his pre-Admission role of Executive Chairman to reflect their contribution to the Company prior to Admission.
Details of these awards are set out below.
In order to create further alignment with shareholders, these awards were made over shares in the form of nil-cost options and split into two equal tranches, which become exercisable on the first and second anniversary of Admission, respectively.
Although these awards were made in recognition of services provided to the Company prior to Admission and, as such, are not subject to continued employment, the Directors Share Bonus Plan Awards only remained exercisable in full if the 90-day average share price prior to the first and second anniversary of Admission was at least 359 pence.
If, at the relevant anniversary, the average share price was at or below 224 pence, the number of shares in the relevant tranche, to which the awards relate, would have been reduced by approximately 35%.
Where the average share price at the relevant anniversary was between 224 pence and 359 pence, the proportion exercisable would be reduced on a pro rata basis.
As the awards were made in respect of the period prior to Admission, they are not subject to continued employment, except in the case of dismissal for cause, however they were subject to the malus provisions detailed in the Remuneration Policy.
These awards were originally granted on 4 July 2014 and no further awards will be made under this arrangement.
First tranche The 90-day average share price on the first anniversary of Admission was 3.438 and, as a result, the first tranche of the award up to 50% of the overall award vested between the minimum and maximum level in 2015.
The balance of the award under the first tranche lapsed.

Second tranche The 90-day average share price on the second anniversary of Admission was 3.3475 and, as a result, the second tranche of the award up to 50% of the overall award vested between the minimum and maximum level during 2016.
