Governance 87 Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements 2016 Annual Remuneration Report The following section provides details of how the Companys Remuneration Policy was applied during the financial year ending 31 December 2016.
2 A s Andy Gulliford and Phil Redding were members of the defined benefit pension scheme until 31 March 2016, this sum comprises the pension input value increase in accrued pension plus cash in lieu of pension from that date.
Further information can be found on page 95.
For David Sleath and Justin Read, this sum comprises cash paid in lieu of pension.
3 I ncludes the cash Bonus payable and monetary value of the shares awarded under the DSBP.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, 50 per cent of any Bonus earned in 2016 will be deferred into shares under the DSBP.
A s the MSCI IPD Benchmark data was not available at the date of publication of the 2015 Annual Report, the 2015 Bonus payments disclosed last year were based on an estimate of 55 per cent of the TPR element.
The TPR element has since been confirmed at 100 per cent and therefore the payment for this element of the Bonus has been adjusted accordingly.
See Chart 3 on page 89 for details of the 2016 Bonus payment.
4 I n the 2015 Annual Report, the monetary value of the 2012 LTIP Award was estimated using a share price of 434.2p.
This has been updated to reflect that when this award actually vested in May 2016, the share price on the date of release was 433.4p.
Consequently, the sum disclosed in the multiple year variable LTIP for 2015 is lower than the sum disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report.
The 2015 reported figures were: David Sleath 737,000: Andy Gulliford 337,000: Justin Read 482,000: and, Phil Redding 317,000.
See page 93 for details about the calculation of the 2012 LTIP Award.
Payout for the 2016 LTIP has been estimated at 100 per cent.
The share price has been estimated at 432.3p based on the three-month average share price ending 31 December 2016.
5 I ncludes SIP, based on the number of shares awarded during the year and the share price at the date of grant, and Sharesave based on the discount represented by the option price, multiplied by the annual savings.
Base salary and benefits With effect from 1 April 2016, the Chief Executives base salary was 601,000 and the base salaries of the Group Finance Director, Chief Investment Officer and the Chief Operating Officer were each 393,500.
With effect from 16 January 2017, the new Chief Financial Officers base salary was 460,000.
With effect from 1 April 2017, each of the Executive Directors, with the exception of the Chief Financial Officer, will receive an increase to base salary of 3 per cent, which is in line with the average allemployee increase.
The Executive Directors currently receive life assurance, private medical insurance, cash allowance in lieu of a company car and cash in lieu of pension.
Non-Executive Directors single figure audited The Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed by the Board in the absence of the Non-Executive Directors, while the fees paid to the Chairman are reviewed by the Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors fees were increased by 2,000 with effect from 1 January 2016.
Following this change the base Non-Executive Director fee is 55,000 per annum, with additional fees of 10,000 for chairing a Board Committee and a further 12,000 for being a Senior Independent Director.
Gerald Corbett is paid 250,000 which is the same as his predecessor.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Companys share-based incentive schemes nor do they receive any other benefits or rights under the pension schemes.
Chart 2 shows the total remuneration received by each of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman during the year.

He became Chairman on 22 April 2016.
Bonus payment 2016 For the Executive Directors, the 2016 Bonus comprised three equally weighted components: EPRA Profit Before Tax PBT : rent roll growth RRG : and relative TPR.
Profit EPRA PBT against target For this element, a Bonus is earned for EPRA PBT performance against target.
50 per cent is earned on achieving the threshold target 142.1 million for 2016, rising to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum target 152.8 million for 2016.
97.7 per cent of this element was achieved in 2016, with EPRA PBT performance for bonus purposes of 152.3 million achieved.
Rent roll growth RRG against target For this element, a Bonus is earned if the rent roll growth from the existing standing stock is positive the threshold.
Once the threshold is achieved, the Bonus is determined based on total RRG existing standing stock plus the impact of development RRG, with a sliding pay-out scale rising from 0per cent for flat total RRG through to 100 per cent for achieving the maximum increase 20.4 million in 2016.
In 2016, RRG from standing stock was positive, thus ensuring the threshold was achieved.
Total RRG including the contribution from developments was 26.9 million for Bonus purposes and, accordingly, 100 per cent of this element was achieved.
TPR Relative TPR against the MSCI IPD Benchmark For this element, 25 per cent is earned when the Companys TPR for the UK and Continental Europe equals the TPR of a comparable MSCIIPD Benchmark, as calculated by MSCI Real Estate, rising on a straight line basis to 100 per cent when the Companys TPR exceeds the MSCI-IPD Benchmark by 1.5 per cent.
TPR performance for the Companys assets for bonus purposes in 2016 was 10.1 per cent, being 10.6 per cent for the UK and 9.0 per cent for Continental Europe.
The MSCI-IPD Benchmark was only available at the date of this Report for the Companys UK assets.
This UK Benchmark The MSCI-IPD Quarterly UK All Industrial Benchmark was 7.4 per cent in 2016.
On the basis of the TPR of the Companys UK assets against Benchmark as noted above, and for the purposes of this Report, the Committee has estimated that 100 per cent of the overall TPR will be achieved for 2016 Bonus payments.
This element of the Bonus will not be paid until the MSCIIPD benchmark data for Continental Europe is available.
Please note that the TPR figures both actual and Benchmark stated above are different to those stated in the KPls on page 20 because the MSCI-IPD benchmark for remuneration payments is based on a TPR with UK European all industrial benchmarks weighted to reflect the approximate geographical mix of the Groups portfolio, unlike the KPI equivalent which is based on to the MSCI-IPD Quarterly UK All Industrial standing assets benchmark and similarly the Companys TPR in the KPI section is the Companys standing assets.
Bonus targets for EPRA PBT and RRG are set at the start of the year using the prevailing exchange rate at the time and are adjusted to reflect changes in the business such as acquisitions and disposals.
The EPRA PBT and RRG outturns which have been used to compare to the 2016 targets were calculated using a consistent exchange rate to that used when the target was set and also include adjustments for specific items in accordance with the Bonus scheme rules as approved by the Committee.
The EPRA PBT and RRG element of the 2016 Bonus will be paid in April 2017, less a 50 per cent deduction for the DSBP.
Payment of the TPR element will be deferred until summer 2017, when the pan-European MSCIIPD data becomes available.
Accordingly, the actual payment made under the TPR element of the 2016 Bonus, together with the deferral under the DSBP, may differ from the amount disclosed in this Report.
The DSBP award will be made once the final Bonus figures can be calculated.
The vesting of the 2016 DSBP will be in April 2020, the third anniversary of the payment of the profit and RRG element of the 2016 Bonus.
Any payments under the 2017 Bonus and the DSBP will be made in accordance with the updated Remuneration Policy subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.

The Committee will determine the TPR element as soon as the measurement can be completed based on actual data.
Any difference between the estimated and actual figures will be reconciled in the 2017 Annual Report.
Bonus payment 2015 Calculation of the TPR element of the Bonus payment is based on comparison with the MSCI IPD Benchmark, the data for which was not available at the time of publication of the 2015 Annual Report.
The Remuneration Committee estimated that 55 per cent of this element would be achieved.
The actual relative TPR against the IPD benchmark for 2015 was calculated as 100 per cent and the Directors were remunerated accordingly.
The TPR of the MSCI IPD benchmark weighted to the Companys portfolio and the Companys TPR were 16.51 per cent and 18.28 per cent respectively.
The Company outperformed the UK Benchmark by 1.77 per cent.

LTIP LTIP awards are subject to TSR and TPR performance conditions, which are equally weighted and measured over a four-year performance period.
TSR this benchmark is based on the weighted mean TSR of other FTSE 350 REITs.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TSR is in line with benchmark TSR, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent vesting if the benchmark is exceeded by 5 per cent per year.
TPR this benchmark is based on the MSCI IPD Benchmark with UK European industrials weighted to reflect the approximate geographical mix of the Groups portfolio 75 25 UK Continental Europe.
25 per cent of this element vests if the Companys four-year TPR is in line with the MSCI IPD Benchmark, rising on a straight-line basis to 100 per cent if the MSCI IPD Benchmark is exceeded by at least 1.5 per cent per year.
On vesting, calculations are reviewed by the auditor and are approved by the Committee.
The Committee retains the discretion to withhold vesting of awards should such payments be deemed inappropriate.
The 2012 Award vested on 7 June 2016, subject to the TSR and TPR performance conditions over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2015.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 137.2 per cent and the benchmarck was 103.0 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 4.0 per cent per annum compared with the benchmark led to an 84.6 per cent vesting of the TSR element and, as estimated in the 2015 Annual Remuneration Report, the TPR element did not vest.
Overall, this resulted in a total payout of 42.3 per cent.
SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 94 Governance Remuneration Committee Report continued The 2013 LTIP award will vest on 6 August 2017, subject to relative TSR and TPR over the four-year performance period to 31 December 2016.
The Companys TSR over the performance period was 117.7 per cent and the benchmark TSR was 40.3 per cent.
The Companys TSR outperformance of 11.6 per cent per annum compared with the benchmark will lead to 100 per cent of the TSR element vesting.
For the 2013 LTIP, the full TPR data will not be available until after the date of this Report.
For the purposes of the Directors single figure calculations Chart 1, the performance for the TPR element has been estimated.
The estimated calculation is based on the Companys actual annualised TPR for both Continental European and UK assets between 2013 and 2016 of 14.7 per cent and an estimated MSCI IPD Benchmark over the same period of 12.9 per cent.
On this basis, the Companys four year TPR to 31 December 2016 has exceeded the estimated MSCI IPD Benchmark by more than 1.5 per cent per year which would lead to 100per cent of the TPR element vesting.
The 2013 LTIP will vest in August 2017 by which time the MSCI IPD Benchmark will be available.
Details of the LTIP awards granted to the Executive Directors are set out in Chart 14.
Any awards made under the LTIP in 2017 will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.

SEGRO Annual Report and Accounts 2016 96 Governance Remuneration Committee Report continued Pension entitlement in the event of severance There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
Fees for external non-executive appointments Since September 2007, David Sleath has been a Non-Executive Director of Bunzl plc and during the year he received a fee of 99,500 for this role.
Exit payments and arrangements No exit payments were made to Directors during the year.
Justin Read retired as Group Finance Director on 31 December 2016.
Justin Reads remuneration terms upon his retirement are in accordance with the key provisions for contract termination as set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in April 2014.
As he was retiring from full-time executive employment, the Committee awarded him good leaver status under the Companys incentive schemes.
He was paid full salary and benefits which include cash allowances in lieu of a company car and pension and also private medical healthcare to 31 December 2016.
He will be eligible to receive a cash bonus for 2016 to the extent that the performance targets are met.
50 per cent of any cash payment earned in 2016 will be deferred in shares under the DSBP.
He will be entitled to receive shares which have been held under the DSBP.
These shares will be released on the vesting date, together with a cash sum equivalent to the value of dividends that would have been paid on the shares during the three year performance period.
He will be entitled to time pro-rata shares from the LTIP, subject to the Company meeting the performance targets for these awards and in accordance with the LTIP rules.
He will be eligible to retain shares awarded under the SIP and to purchase shares in accordance with the rules of Sharesave.
Remuneration Arrangements for Chief Financial Officer Soumen Das joined the Company as Chief Financial Officer on 16 January 2017.
The Committee took professional advice and agreed his remuneration, taking into account the fact that he was an exceptional candidate and moving from an organisation where the package offered more in the way of variable remuneration.
He receives a salary of 460,000 p. a. an increase of 2 per cent from his previous employer and he will not receive an increase in 2017, standard benefits commensurate with this position, cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20 per cent of salary, annual bonus opportunity up to 120per cent and a LTIP opportunity for 2017 only of 300 per cent of salary.
His LTIP opportunity will reduce to 200 per cent of salary in 2018.
As mentioned earlier in the report, we are seeking shareholder approval to increase the Bonus opportunity to 150 per cent of salary, which, if approved will apply to Soumen Das in line with the other Executive Directors.
In order to recruit Soumen Das it was necessary to buy out his 2016 bonus entitlement and the share awards he forfeited upon leaving his previous employer.
Details of any compensation for the loss of 2016 Bonus entitlement will be determined as soon as is practicable following the publication of his previous employers results, would be pro-rated for time, and structured on a like-for-like basis, with 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent deferred into SEGRO shares, the release of which would be subject to continued employment for three years.
He will receive a buy-out award of shares to compensate him for the share awards he forfeited upon leaving his previous employer, some of which will be subject to performance conditions.
In accordance with the Policy, the fair value of these replacement awards in SEGRO shares was based on the fair value of the share awards forfeited.
The forfeited share awards comprised restricted shares vesting on dates from September 2016 to April 2019, and performance shares vesting on 1 April 2017, 1 April 2018, 11 March 2019 and 5 April 2019.
The fair value of these awards was estimated at 1.2 million in restricted shares and 0.7 million in performance shares.
The replacement awards were structured on a like-for-like basis with 562,442 replacement shares awarded, 286,161 of which are subject to performance conditions, with a similar or longer time horizon.
The 286,161 shares are structured identically to the LTIP and include performance conditions based on relative TSR and relative TPR, and vest in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
100 per cent of net shares vesting must be retained until the Companys shareholding guidelines for share ownership are satisfied.
Governance 97 Overview Strategic Report Financial Statements Former Directors audited Ex gratia payments totalling 56,470 2015: 56,470 were made during the year to four former Directors, who retired at least 10 years ago.
These payments were made under legacy arrangements which are no longer offered.
Remuneration Committee advisers The Committee has access to sufficient resources to discharge its duties, which include access to independent remuneration advisers, the General Counsel and Group Company Secretary, the Group HR Director and other advisers as required.
The Committee is responsible for appointing its external advisers and during the year it received advice from Kepler Associates, a brand of Mercer Kepler, which is a founding member and signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, in discharging its responsibilities.
Kepler was appointed by the Remuneration Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
During the year, Kepler and Deloitte provided advice on Executive Directors remuneration, the Remuneration Policy, and market and best practice guidance.
Total fees for advice to the Remuneration Committee in 2016 were 74,624 2015: 44,868 and 15,000 2015: 0 respectively, on the basis of time and materials.
The Committee evaluates the support provided by its advisers periodically and is comfortable that Kepler provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with SEGRO which may impair its independence.
To ensure a consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, Kepler also provides advice to the Company in respect of matters relating to the remuneration of all employees.
Aon Hewitt Limited provided information to the Company in respect of pension-related matters.
During the year, Slaughter and May provided advice to the Company in respect of its share-based incentive schemes as well as regulatory and pension matters.
