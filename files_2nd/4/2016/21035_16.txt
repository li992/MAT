DIRECTORS REPORT Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 63 REMUNERATION REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT MICHAEL BURROW Chairman of the Remuneration Committee CURRENT YEAR Dear Shareholder Incentive policy I have decided to divide my statement into two The performance conditions for both the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and the Performance Share Plan PSP, which operated sections this year.

The Committee feels that this is an appropriate level of reward for the performance of the Group and the hard work put in by our executive directors.
Long-term sustainable performance One of the primary objectives of the Committee is to incentivise and reward sustained long-term performance of the Group.
The charts below show the performance over the last seven years in terms of the four performance criteria selected for the PSP, which are designed to operate across the cycle.
Each chart has been overlaid with the relative level of total remuneration earned by our chief executive for each of these years.
The Committee believes that there is a strong link between the level of performance demonstrated by these criteria and remuneration of the chief executive.
The TSR chart demonstrates the impact of the significant proportion of remuneration paid to the chief executive in equity, which ensures he shares the experience of shareholders over the period.
This can also be seen when looking at the other charts where, while financial performance has been strong, the single figure has gone down over the last two years due to the lower value of the vested awards.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration policy has worked well in both incentivising and rewarding performance and aligning interests with shareholders.
The changes proposed in the new policy will build on this success.
The following table sets out the performance conditions and targets, weightings, actual performance and associated level of vesting: Weighting Threshold Maximum % of of award level of level of element of Measure to measure vesting 25% vesting 100% Actual award vested TSR 40% Median Upper quartile 59% 52% EPS growth 25% 6% CAGR 12% CAGR 39% 100% RoI 25% 10% 15% 19% 100% Leverage 10% Less than 2.5 1.7 100% TSR performance is estimated based on performance to 30 April 2016, which was at the 59th percentile level.
FUTURE YEARS Background The current remuneration policy was formally approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and received a 96.8% vote in favour.
The policy became effective for a period of up to three years from that date, which would suggest a normal review date of 2017.
Since the drafting and approval of this policy, Ashtead has continued to deliver exceptional performance, growth and associated returns to its shareholders.
This highly successful growth path has led the Committee to conclude that a review of the remuneration policy should be conducted, and an amended policy brought forward in 2016.
The Committee is cognisant of the views expressed by some of its shareholders in the voting patterns on the remuneration reports for both 2013 14 and 2014 15, and determined that the most appropriate and complete response was to review the policy as well as its implementation.
The Committees expectation is that the new policy will enable greater alignment with business objectives and shareholder expectations.
In undertaking the review, the Committee believed it important that the future remuneration policy was tailored to Ashteads circumstances, such that it: supports the Groups strategy over the next stage of its development: continues to act as an appropriate tool with which to attract, retain and motivate the executive directors who are critical to executing the business strategy and driving the continued creation of value for shareholders: ensures that remuneration is competitive against companies of a similar size and complexity: and reflects practice in the Groups listing environment being the UK whilst being cognisant of its relatively diverse shareholder base which now contains almost 40% US-based investors and also Ashteads main area of operation being North America, given that in 2015 16, 86% of revenue was generated in this region.
As a result of this review, the Committee concluded that a number of changes to the remuneration policy were required.
These changes, if approved, will mean that Ashtead has in place a policy which is appropriate for the next three-year period of the Groups development.
66 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Committee believes that these approaches are aligned better Context of remuneration review with remuneration objectives and the Groups strategy and will Ashtead continues to deliver exceptionally strong growth and enable us to both retain and recruit competitively, as required, associated returns to investors.

As noted in the policy changes section, the increases to the DBP and PSP will not be implemented during 2016 17, but provide scope for future increases should these become necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the Companys reward arrangements.
DIRECTORS REPORT Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 67 CONCLUSION In undertaking its review, the Committee believes that the future The Committee believes that remuneration policy is tailored to the Groups circumstances, such that it: the proposed remuneration supports the Groups strategy over the next stage of development: policy is in the best long-term continues to act as an appropriate tool with which to attract, retain and motivate executive management who are crucial interests of the Group and to executing the business strategy and the continued creation its shareholders.

As noted above in the context of the The proposed policy is set out in full on pages 68 to 75 of this report.
review, the Committee specifically considered the KPIs of the business as part of this exercise.
Other than the relative TSR The Committee believes that the proposed remuneration policy is in metric, all three of the other performance metrics in the PSP EPS, the best long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders and RoI and leverage are taken from these KPIs.
Taking into account I strongly recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the 2016 the cyclical nature of Ashtead, the Committee continues to believe policy and the 2016 Directors remuneration report.
that delivering consistent performance throughout the cycle is the most appropriate approach to rewarding executives under the PSP.
As a result, the Committee has retained the same targets in respect of EPS, RoI and leverage since 2012 13 and intends to continue to do so.
The Committee has, however, adjusted the relative TSR metric to MICHAEL BURROW reflect the most appropriate external comparator group available.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee In 2012 13 and 2013 14, this was the FTSE 250 index.
For the PSP awards made in 2014 15 and 2015 16, the comparator group was the FTSE 75-125.
As can be seen from this, the Committee has, therefore, sought to reflect the growth of Ashtead in its PSP metrics and targets.
SHAREHOLDER CONSULTATION On behalf of the Committee I met with, or corresponded with, the Companys major shareholders holding just over 50% of the issued share capital.
The feedback on the proposed policy changes varied and this feedback has been taken into account in both the policy and how it will be implemented for the next three years.
Overall, shareholders were broadly supportive of the proposed changes.
During the consultation process, some shareholders expressed a preference that some of the conditions attaching to the PSP awards should be amended.
When setting the four performance metrics, the Committee intended that the conditions should prevail throughout the cycle and the dynamic tension between the metrics would deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value.
Shareholders were comforted to hear that the metrics would be throughout the cycle.
Whilst the leverage ratio was mentioned by a number of shareholders, this was in the context of the appropriate level of leverage for the business.
68 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED REMUNERATION POLICY This report has been prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the relevant sections of the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations.
It explains how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Regulations require the auditor to report to the Companys members on elements of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The audited information is included on pages 75 to 79.
As set out in the Committee chairmans letter on pages 63 to 67, the Committee undertook a review of the Groups remuneration arrangements during the year.
The proposed changes to the Groups existing policy, approved in 2014, are set out in that letter.
The proposed 2016 policy set out below includes these changes.
Two ordinary resolutions concerning the Directors remuneration report will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 7 September 2016.
The first resolution is in respect of the implementation of the 2014 policy for the year ended 30 April 2016.
The second resolution seeks shareholders approval for the 2016 policy to apply for the next three years.
The aim of the remuneration policy set out below is to reward executives for delivering a sustainable increase in shareholder value over a long period of time.
Accordingly, we seek to: set the total remuneration package at a level that is competitive in the markets in which we operate: align executives interests with those of shareholders: link a significant element of total remuneration to the achievement of stretching performance targets over the long term: provide a total remuneration package that is balanced between fixed remuneration and variable, performance-based remuneration: and enable recruitment and retention of high-calibre executives without paying more than necessary to fill the role.

Notes to the policy table: 1.
I n relation to the DBP, individual awards to directors are dependent on the most relevant measure of profit for the role which they perform, and thus over which they have the most direct influence.
Profit is a key component of earnings per share, one of the Groups key performance indicators and is considered the primary measure which aligns with shareholders interests.
Total shareholder return measures the relative return from Ashtead against an appropriate comparator group, providing alignment with shareholders interests.
Earnings per share is also a key measure ensuring sustainable profit generation over the longer term and is a measure which is aligned with shareholders interests.
c. Return on investment is a key internal measure to ensure the effective use of capital in the business which is highly cyclical and with high capital requirements.
d. T he use of leverage alongside the other performance measures ensures there is an appropriate dynamic tension and balance, maintaining leverage discipline in a capital-intensive business.
I n relation to both the DBP and the PSP, malus and clawback provisions exist which enable the Committee to reduce or eliminate the number of shares, notional shares or unvested shares held or reduce the amount of any money payable or potentially payable and or to require the transfer to the Company of all or some of the shares acquired or to pay to the Company an amount equal to all or part of any benefit or value derived from, or attributable to, the plans in case of material misstatement of accounts or action or conduct of an award holder or award holders which in the reasonable opinion of the Board, amounts to fraud or gross misconduct.
72 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Share-based incentives and dilution limits The Company observes an overall dilution limit of 10% in 10 years for all Company share schemes, together with a limit of 5% in 10 years for discretionary schemes.
Remuneration policy on new hires When hiring a new executive director, the Committee will seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy summarised above.
In addition, where the executive has to relocate, the level of relocation package will be assessed on a case by case basis.
Although it is not the Committees policy to buy out former incentive arrangements as a matter of course, it will consider compensating an incoming executive with like-kind incentive arrangements for foregone incentives with their previous employer, taking into account the length of the period they were held and an assessment of the likely vesting value.
The Committee will ensure that such arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and the shareholders without paying more than is necessary.
Total remuneration opportunity Our remuneration arrangements are designed so that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of short and long-term objectives designed to create shareholder value.
The charts below illustrate the potential future reward opportunity for each of the executive directors, based on the remuneration policy set out on pages 68 to 71 and the base salary at 1 May 2016 and the sterling dollar exchange rate at 30 April 2016.

The comparator group for that element of any award above 150% of base salary is FTSE 350 companies ranked 50th to 100th by market capitalisation.
For performance between the lower and upper target ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
The 2012 PSP award vested in full on 9 October 2015 with EPS for 2014 15 of 50% exceeding the upper target of 12% and the Companys TSR performance ranked it 13th within the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
RoI was 19% and leverage 1.8 times.
EPS is based on the profit before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquired intangibles less the tax charge included in the accounts.
Historically, TSR performance has been measured relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company was a FTSE 250 company.
From 2014 15 the comparator group is comprised primarily of those companies in the FTSE 350 ranked 75th to 125th by market capitalisation excluding investment trusts.
The Companys TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and FTSE 100 excluding investment trusts is shown on page 80.
