Legacy arrangements The Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payment or payment for loss of office outside the policy in this report where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect, provided in the case of any payment whose terms were agreed after the previous Directors Remuneration Policy was approved at the Companys 2014 AGM and before the policy in this report became effective, the remuneration payment or payment for loss of office was permitted under that former policy.
For these purposes, payment includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
In accordance with the rules of the DSBP, participants are entitled to dividend equivalents determined by reference to dividends that would have been paid on shares in respect of dividend record dates between grant and the date on which the shares subject to the DSBP award are acquired.
Dividend equivalents may be awarded on this basis in respect of the deferred share element of bonuses earned for the financial years ended 30 September 2013, 30 September 2014 and 30 September 2015.
In accordance with the policy table, the deferred share element of bonuses earned for the financial year ended 30 September 2016 and future years will only attract dividend equivalents by reference to dividends that would have been paid on shares in respect of dividend record dates between grant and vesting.
