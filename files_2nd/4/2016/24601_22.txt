Members of the Management Board also participate in the PSP with the same performance conditions as the executive directors.
Members of the Management Board are encouraged to build up a Hays shareholding equivalent to 100% of their base salary.
Employees below the Management Board receive salary and benefits which are benchmarked to the local markets and countries in which they work.
There is a strong tie of performance to reward which is recognised through annual bonuses, commission or other non-financial recognition.
Employees who hold key strategic positions or are deemed critical to the business through their performance are also offered the opportunity to participate in the PSP with performance conditions based on Group EPS results measured over one year.
Any shares that crystallise at the end of the performance period have a further two-year holding period prior to vesting.
During this time there is also a personal performance underpin.
In addition nine countries offer a Sharesave plan to employees.
A Resolution will be put to Shareholders at the 2016 AGM to introduce a US Stock Purchase Plan for employees in the USA.
As stated in our Remuneration Policy, each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the executive directors and the members of the Management Board, the Committee considers a report prepared by the Group Head of Reward detailing remuneration practice across the Group.
The report provides a regional overview of how employee pay compares to the market, any material changes during the year and includes detailed analysis of basic pay and variable pay changes within the UK where all of the executive directors and most of the Management Board are based.
While the Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating the remuneration policy, the Company takes account of feedback from the broader employee population on an annual basis using the engagement survey which includes a number of questions relating to remuneration.
The table below summarises the above.

The Chief Executives remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits, excluding his allowance in lieu of pension, and annual bonus including any amount deferred.
The UK employee pay on which the average percentage change is based is calculated using the increase in the earnings of UK-based, full-time employees who are eligible for increases in salary benefits and who participate in the standard discretionary i. e. not commission based annual bonus plans employees who receive bonuses on a monthly or other time-scale basis are excluded.
It uses P11d data from tax years 2015 and 2016.
Part-time employees have been excluded from the analysis as many will have experienced material changes in pay during the period due to their change of hours.
Hays plc | 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements 82 REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED The comparison figures are based on relevant UK employees as described above as both executive directors and most of the Management Board are UK based and this is considered to be an appropriate comparison.

The comparator group is: Adecco SA, CDI Corporation, Kelly Services Inc. Manpower Inc. Michael Page International Plc now Page Group, Randstad Holdings nv, Robert Half International Inc. Robert Walters Plc, and SThree Plc.
During FY16 USG People NV was purchased by Recruit Holdings Co. Ltd and its shares delisted.
It is therefore no longer in the comparator group.
2 The Committee took into account the following factors when setting the EPS targets for the award: Budget the setting of which is a robust and transparent process.
Company budget for FY17 and the expectations for performance: Strategic direction of the business over the period covered by the PSP award: Market conditions and visibility of future trading.
The final threshold and maximum targets will be adjusted to reflect the actual RPI once known.
3 The award is subject to Malus for the three-year performance period and Clawback for two years post vesting.
When the Committee met in August 2016 to finalise the targets for FY17, it was in the context of a more uncertain economic outlook, especially in the UK following the Brexit referendum result.
The Committee carefully considered the targets it should apply to incentive awards i. e. both annual bonus and PSP awards for FY17.
In setting the EPS target which represents one-third of the PSP award for the FY17 PSP award, noting that the mechanics for this are consistent with prior years, it is recognised that the EPS target range is lower in absolute terms than the target applied to the awards made in FY16.
However the Committee is comfortable that these targets are no less challenging in relative terms than the targets applied to the FY16 PSP awards and are consistent with external forecasts at that time.
4.2 Non-executive directors The Committee reviewed the Group Chairmans fee during FY16 and determined that it should increase by 2.0% for FY17.
This is in line with the pay review for other employees in the Company.
The Board reviewed the fees for the other non-executive directors NEDs during FY16.
They determined that their base fee should increase by 2.0% for FY17 in line with other increases across the Company.
All increases are effective from 1 July 2016.
The table below shows the changes.

OVERVIEWSTRATEGIC   INFORMATION Hays plc | 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements 85 5.3 Terms of reference The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed Terms of Reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for determining specific packages for the executive directors, the Chairman and other senior executives.
The Company consults with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements.
The Terms of Reference for the Committee are available on the Companys website, haysplc.
com, and from the Company Secretary at the registered office.
5.4 Meetings in 2016 The Committee normally meets at least four times per year.
During 2016, it formally met four times as well as having ongoing dialogue via email or telephone discussion.
The meetings principally discussed the following key issues and activities: A review of the basic pay, bonus and PSP awards of the executive directors and other senior executives: Consideration of the appropriateness of the existing arrangements for the 2017 financial year: A review of the reward strategy in the context of Group risk: Consideration of the relationship between executive reward and the reward structures in place for other Group employees: A review of the Committees Terms of Reference: and Initial review of the future structure and appropriateness of the remuneration for executive directors in the light of being a cyclical business and in consideration of the new binding vote in 2017.
5.5 Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Committee has continued to engage the services of  LLP PwC as its independent adviser, who were appointed in 2014 following a formal tender process.
During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of remuneration policy for executive directors and members of the Management Board.
PwC also provided advice to the Company in relation to corporate tax, indirect tax and legal services.
This work is carried out by an entirely separate group within PwC and is not felt to be in conflict with the independence and objectivity of the work carried out for the Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective and independent advice is given to Remuneration Committees.
The total fee for 2016 in relation to Committee work was 198,700 excluding VAT.
While fee estimates are generally required for each piece of work, fees are calculated based on time, with hourly rates in line with the level of expertise and seniority of the adviser concerned.
Following the successful tender by PwC to become the Companys new external Auditor, from 1 July 2016 PwC no longer act as the independent adviser to the Remuneration Committee.
A new tender process will be conducted during FY17.
5.6 Engagement with shareholders The Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and any changes to the Companys executive pay arrangements in particular.
As the next binding vote on our executive Remuneration Policy approaches, the Committee is very mindful of the importance of having pro-active discussions with shareholders should there be any material changes to its remuneration structure or approach.
5.7 Considering risk Each year, the Committee considers the executive remuneration structure in the light of its key areas of risk.
The summary table on page 69 indicates how the Remuneration Policy takes into account these risks.
The Committee takes into consideration whether the achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the Company when it evaluates the executives performance.
5.8 General governance The Directors Report on Remuneration has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, the revised provisions of the Code and the Listing Rules.
