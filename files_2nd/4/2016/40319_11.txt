Corporate information Remuneration report Introduction I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration report for the financial period 1 February 2016 to 9 December 2016.
Our remuneration policy was approved at our 2015 Annual General Meeting.
No changes are being made to that policy, which is available for review on the Companys website.
Shareholder feedback The Companys remuneration report received a significant percentage of votes against at the 2016 Annual General Meeting 37.64%.
The majority of these votes against were attributable to one shareholder who also voted against a number of other resolutions.
Given this, and the Companys change of strategy and the resulting sale of its investment portfolio on which the shareholder in question voted in favour, it was not considered necessary to consult with shareholders on the Companys remuneration practices during this period.
Reasons for voting against the remuneration report were received from shareholders holding approximately 4% of the voting rights and included: following proxy adviser guidance: and the absence of a two-year holding period requirement following vesting of long-term awards.
No reasons for voting against were given by other shareholders.
Developments during the period In September 2016, the Company received an unsolicited takeover offer from HarbourVest Structured Solutions III L. P. HarbourVest at a price of 650p per share.
This was followed by a period of intense work by management to ensure that better shareholder value was delivered, which resulted in the sale of the Companys investment portfolio which completed in mid-January 2017 and a change to the Companys investment objective and policy to conduct an orderly realisation of its assets and to progressively return cash to shareholders.
In order to ensure that staff were retained and treated fairly during the process, the Committee met on several occasions after the takeover bid from HarbourVest was received to monitor the situation and decide how best to compensate staff.
The sale of the Companys investment portfolio is likely to return 715p per share to shareholders, compared to the 650p per share initially offered by HarbourVest, generating a significant increase in shareholder value.
In early November 2016, the Committee met to consider a bonus proposal for the Chief Executive and to agree bonus principles for the rest of the Groups employees.
Details of the bonus award can be found on page 25.
This bonus was payable for work performed in the period from 1 February 2016 to 31 October 2016.
The Committee considered the earlier timing of the bonus payment appropriate in light of the unusual circumstances presented by the HarbourVest takeover bid and subsequent sale of the Companys investment portfolio to HarbourVest and the hard work and professionalism of the staff in responding to those circumstances.
No bonus will be payable for work performed after 31 October 2016 or for work performed in 2017.
At that same meeting, the Committee considered the impact of the takeover bid and subsequent agreement to sell the Companys investment portfolio on the Companys performance share plan PSP and deferred share bonus plan DSBP.
By that time, a redundancy consultation process had commenced with all Group employees.
The Committee concluded that, in light of the unusual circumstances and the hard work and professionalism of the staff in responding to those circumstances, it was appropriate for all awards under the PSP and DSBP to vest early and, where appropriate, for the relevant performance conditions to be treated as fully satisfied, with all awards vesting fully.
At an earlier meeting, the Committee agreed the redundancy terms to be offered to Group employees.
22 SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts for the 45 weeks to 9 December 2016 SVG Capital plc Interim Report 2016 Corporate information Performance in the period A number of metrics both financial and non-financial were used to assess Company and management performance during the period: HarbourVest takeover bid and subsequent agreement to sell the Companys investment portfolio the receipt of the takeover bid triggered a period of intense work by management.
Throughout the difficult process all management staff demonstrated dedication and professionalism which resulted in a sale of investment portfolio that is expected to return 715p per share to shareholders, significantly above the 650p per share initially offered.
NAV growth net asset value NAV per share increased by 10% during the period.
Total Shareholder Return TSR the share price increased from 491p to 713p during the period, an increase of 45%.
Culture robust risk management and compliance regimes were operated to ensure that all staff remained focused on these important issues in their day-to-day roles.
The Committee considered that the response to the HarbourVest takeover bid was the most significant contribution to performance during the period.
As such, objectives set at the start of the year were less relevant than would normally be the case.
The Committee has reviewed the results described above and takes the view that the Chief Executives performance was outstanding across the range of both financial and non-financial metrics and, in particular, with respect to the way the takeover bid and subsequent sale of the investment portfolio were handled and the leadership that was demonstrated over the period.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee The Committee met on three occasions in the period.
It continued to operate the existing LTIP and deferred bonus schemes.
It met to ensure that staff were retained and treated fairly during the period immediately following the HarbourVest takeover bid and to decide how best to compensate staff.
Looking forward, the Committee notes that all staff have been or will be made redundant.
It has been agreed that no further bonuses or awards under LTIP schemes will be made.
Those staff that remain employed to oversee the winding-down of the Company will be paid salary and associated benefits in accordance with the existing remuneration policy, through to the winding-up and liquidation of the Company.
Redundancy arrangements are in line with market practice and involve payment of notice and a redundancy payment calculated by reference to completed years worked for the Group.
