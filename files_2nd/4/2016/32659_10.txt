Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to provide the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 1 January 2017, my first as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Committee.
This was a busy and challenging year for the Committee, particularly with the number of changes on the Board.
The current Directors Remuneration Policy was adopted at the 2015 Annual General Meeting AGM, so although there will be no need for a vote on the Policy at the forthcoming AGM, the Committee has spent considerable time reviewing how the Policy is applied and has tightened its implementation, bringing it more in line with best practice.
A full review of the Policy will be undertaken in 2017, in advance of the 2018 AGM and shareholder resolution on the Policy.
Mike Tye The annual statement and annual report on remuneration, which provide details of the remuneration earned by Directors in the year to 1 January 2017 and how the Policy will be implemented for the 2017 financial year will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at this years AGM.
Board changes For the year under review, the most notable remuneration related decisions concerned the changes to the executive team.
In agreeing the exit and joining terms the Remuneration Committee was conscious of the approved Policy and further decided that where appropriate the terms would be revised in line with market best practice, which is a more demanding position than the current published Policy.
As a result, the new executive Directors will be required to defer 50% of any bonus earned as opposed to any bonus in excess of 100% of salary.
A two year post-vesting holding period applies to all net of tax shares earned under the long-term incentive plan LTIP and executive Directors are required to retain all net of tax shares until the shareholding guideline is met.
The Committee re-considered the appropriate length of notice periods and in the current context concluded that six months provides both the Company and the individual with sufficient notice for a newly appointed Director.
However, over time the Committee may increase notice periods to one year in line with the current approved policy.
The Committee also decided to reduce the quantum of shares vesting at threshold in the LTIP issued to the new executive Directors from 25% to 10%, thus ensuring that the executive Directors were fully aligned in sharing restoration of value to shareholders as the turnaround of the business progresses.
For both departing executive Directors, they will receive their 12 month contractual payment in lieu of notice by way of monthly instalments, subject to mitigation.
No payment will be made in lieu of annual bonus during the notice period.
There is no entitlement to a bonus in respect of the financial year ending 2016.
All LTIP awards held lapsed on cessation of employment.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2016 37 Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration in 2016 2016 was a challenging year for the Group and the Committee spent a significant amount of time considering the annual bonus arrangements of the new executive Directors.
Balancing the performance of the Company in the first half of the year with the need to incentivise and reward the new executive Directors, the Committee determined that it would limit maximum bonus entitlement for this year to 50% of the maximum bonus, and that any payment would be pro-rated to reflect full months of service.
The Committee set challenging underlying profit before tax PBT targets with, for the first time, a stretching like-for-like LFL covers target.
As a result annual bonuses of 30% of maximum for the Chief Executive Officer and 24% for the Chief Financial Officer were awarded, which have then been pro-rated down to reflect full months of service with the Company.
50% of the award will be deferred in shares for three years.
No LTIP awards vested for executive Directors during 2016.
In line with the remuneration policy on recruitment, as soon as practicable following appointment LTIP awards were granted to the new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of 200% and 130% of salary respectively, based on stretching total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS targets.
Both the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer bought shares that qualify towards their personal shareholding guideline.
Remuneration for 2017 The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the Directors Remuneration Policy to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and incentivisation of high calibre executives to deliver the Groups strategy.
It is equally important that the Policy reflects shareholders views and the changing landscape in which the Group operates.
For 2017, the maximum annual bonus for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will be 150% and 120% of salary respectively.
50% of any bonus will be deferred for three years.
The Committee intends to grant LTIP awards of 175% and 130% of salary respectively, based on stretching TSR and EPS targets.
No salary increases were awarded to the executive Directors for 2017.
This is consistent with the rest of the workforce with the exception of those on the National Living Wage who, will in April 2017, receive the increase prescribed by the government depending on their age.
For those employees over 25 this equates to a 4% increase to 7.50 per hour.
In light of last years voting outcome and the major board changes in the year, the Committee consulted major shareholders and those we have spoken with have responded positively to the changes to the implementation of the Policy.
Given the context of these changes, we hope that you will be supportive of the resolution to approve the annual statement and the annual report on remuneration at this years AGM.
