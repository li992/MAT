the current policy remains broadly appropriate, subject to minor changes to the incentive arrangements and to provide some flexibility Iain Ferguson for the Committee to select performance metrics in line with the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee evolving Company strategy.
In considering the proposed increases in annual bonus maximum, the Committee has taken into account the importance, during the current stage of the Groups transformation, of Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 85 Directors remuneration policy report The policy will be presented to shareholders at the AGM on 18 May 2017 for approval by binding vote.
Policy overview The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the Companys remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number of factors, including: general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market the balance between fixed and variable pay more specifically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately high level of potential remuneration the strategy of the business the views of investors and their representative bodies.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when setting executive Directors reward packages.
A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise: Consideration of shareholders views 85 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group 85 Summary of executive Directors remuneration policy 86 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors 88 Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors 88 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors 89 External appointments of executive Directors 89 Appointment of non-executive Directors 90 Consideration of shareholders views The Committee considers feedback from shareholders received at each AGM, and any feedback from additional meetings or from published investor guidelines, as part of any review of executive remuneration.
In addition, the Committee engages proactively with shareholders and will ensure that shareholders are consulted in advance, where any material changes to the remuneration policy and implementation of that policy are proposed.
Indeed, major investors were consulted in advance of the publication of the revised Remuneration Policy.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group In determining the remuneration of the Companys Directors, the Committee takes into account the general trends in pay and conditions across the Group as a whole.
Whilst employees have not been consulted formally on executive pay, due in part to the diverse geographic disposition of the Group, the Committee seeks to ensure that the underlying principles which form the basis for decisions on Directors pay are consistent with those on which pay decisions for the rest of the workforce are taken.
These are focused for the most part on market competitiveness, business performance and personal performance.
In practice, the remuneration policy for executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, so that a significant proportion of their remuneration is dependent on Company performance.
For employees below Board level, variable pay represents a lower proportion of their total remuneration, which is driven by market comparators and general performance.

6 No share price appreciation or dividend awards have been assumed for the DBP shares and the PSP awards.
Recruitment and promotion policy for executive Directors To ensure the ongoing leadership continuity of the Group, the Company will seek the appointment of high-calibre executives, either by external appointment or internal promotion.
The remuneration package for a new executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of theCompanys remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the scope and complexity of the role, the experience ofthe individual, the prevailing market rate for that experience and the importance and immediacy of securing that candidate.
The salary would be set at a level, based on the principles above, to secure the most appropriate candidate but paying no more than is necessary and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The AIP potential would be limited to 150% of salary, and grants under the PSP may be up to the plan maximum of 200% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards were consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any remuneration awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according toits terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses as appropriate.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 89 Service agreements and payments for loss of office for executive Directors It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which can be terminated on one years notice by the Company and six months notice by the executive Director.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.
In the event of termination, the following principles will apply: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by the Company, six months by the executive Director.
In the event of termination by the Company for cause the executive Director would not be entitled to notice of termination under his or her contract of employment or to any payment in lieu of notice.
Notice payments If any existing contract was terminated by the Company other than for cause, it would be liable to pay an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and including any period of garden leave.
The Company may elect to make payment in lieu of any unexpired period of notice comprising salary and a cash sum in lieu of benefits.
The Company reserves the right to apply mitigation to any notice payment or payment in lieu of notice for example, by making phased payments where appropriate for the balance of any notice period, against which earnings from new employment are offset.
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for outstanding share awards in certain circumstances see below.
In all cases, performance targets would apply.
Change of control There are no provisions for enhanced termination payments in the event of change of control of the Company.
Incidental expenses and other payments The Company may meet relocation and other incidental expenses on termination of employment, for example relocation expenses, the fees of legal or other professional advisers, and accrued but untaken holiday.
It may also elect to continue to provide certain benefits rather than making payment in lieu of the benefit in question.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, awards will not be forfeited on cessation of employment and, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will vest under the normal vesting schedule, being reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that PSP awards vest at cessation and or to amend time pro-rating.
Outstanding DBP awards will lapse on cessation of employment, except in certain good leavercircumstances prescribed by the plan rules when DBP awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
External appointments of executive Directors The Committee recognises that benefits can arise from allowing executive Directors to take a non-executive directorship elsewhere.
Executive Directors are permitted to have one external appointment, from which fees may be retained with the approval of the Board.

Performance targets for the AIP in 2017 For 2017, the AIP for the executive Directors will be a maximum bonus of 150% of base salary subject to shareholder approval of the revised Remuneration Policy based on the achievement of three performance measures: profit before tax 40% cash 35% strategic business and personal objectives 25%.
The Committee will ensure that the targets continue to be set at a stretching level particularly given the higher incentive opportunity proposed for 2017 as part of the revised Remuneration Policy.
The three elements are measured and calculated independently of each other and 50% of any bonus earned will be deferred for three years in Balfour Beatty shares.
While the Committee has chosen not to disclose in advance the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be presented in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance targets for PSP awards granted in 2017 Subject to shareholder approval of the revised Remuneration Policy, the Group Chief Executive will be granted a PSP award over shares worth 200% of salary and the Chief Financial Officer 175% of salary.
Consistent with the approach adopted in 2015 and 2016, the PSP awards to be granted in 2017 will be based on the achievement of three performance measures: relative TSR 33.3% the Companys TSR measured against a comparator group of UK listed companies ranked 51200 by market capitalisation in the FTSE All Share Index excluding investment trusts as at 1 January 2017, the start of the performance period.

As at the date of publication of this Remuneration report, the Committee had not finalised the EPS and cash performance targets for the PSP awards to be granted in 2017.
These EPS and cash targets will be set at an appropriate level of stretch and will be fully disclosed in the RNS announcement issued immediately following the grant of the PSP award and in the Remuneration report for 2017.
Non-executive Directors As detailed in the Policy Report, the Companys approach to setting non-executive Directors fees is by reference to fees paid at similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
A summary of current fees is as follows: 1 July 2015 1 July 2016 % increase Chairman 270,000 270,000 0% Base fee 56,000 56,000 0% Senior Independent Director fee 10,000 10,000 0% Committee chair fee 10,000 10,000 0% For non-executive Directors based outside Europe, the travel allowance for each overseas visit made on Company business remains at2,500.
