discipline, 2016 was another strong year for the Group.
The RoTE performance period for these awards ended Before the reduction in the Ogden discount rate announced on 31 December 2016.

rate which may or may not lead to a further change to the Ogden discount rate.
In these exceptional circumstances and, given that the impact of the post-year-end announcement was to reduce this element from paying out at the likely full 55% to 10%, the Committee will keep the out-turn under the 2016 Clare Thompson AIP assessment under review until the end of 2017.
If, during Chair of the Remuneration Committee 2017, in connection with the consultation the Ogden discount rate is raised from minus 0.75%, the Committee will recalculate the out-turn for this element and adjust it accordingly: the impact of such a subsequent change in the Ogden discount rate would be excluded from the 2017 AIP.
Accordingly, the incentive outcomes for our Executive Directors were as follows: We awarded bonuses of 43% of the maximum to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Chief Financial Officer for 2016.
We have detailed the bonus determination process for 2016 on pages 88 and 89.
Awards under the LTIP granted in March and August 2013 vested during 2016.
They were subject to TSR performance over the three-year vesting period, and RoTE performance in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
As disclosed last year, the Group achieved an average RoTE of 17.6% over the threeyear performance period.
This resulted in 94% of the maximum potential vesting of the RoTE element 56.4% of the total award.
The TSR element comprises the other 40% of the total award.
For the March 2013 and August 2013 awards, the Companys TSR was positioned above upper quintile against its comparator group.
This resulted in 100% of the maximum potential vesting under the TSR element.
Overall, 96.4% of the total awards vested in March 2016 and August 2016.

2013 LTIP awards RoTE The expected vesting outcome figures for the RoTE portion of the awards granted under the LTIP in 2013 and reported in 2015 have been updated.
These updates are based on the actual vesting of the RoTE portion of the awards and a share price of 3.716 and 3.634 on 29 March 2016 and 30 August 2016 respectively, compared to the three-month average share price of 3.9728 used in reporting this figure in the 2015 remuneration report.
The revised figures reflect the actual number of dividends accrued on this portion of the award at vesting.
This results in an adjusted reportable decrease of approximately 19,277 for Paul Geddes and 11,670 for John Reizenstein, with a corresponding decrease of the single figure for 2015 reflected in the table above 5.
2014 LTIP awards RoTE the expected levels of vesting are set out on page 90.

AIP outcomes for 2016 The Committee established target performance levels at the start of the year.
The Committees approach to setting and assessing PBT targets under the AIP is to set a target level of profit performance and then, at the year end, to assess over or underperformance by judging overall corporate performance both on an absolute and relative basis.
While the Committee does not set a formal threshold to maximum profit range against which performance is formulaically assessed the original intent was, following the year end, to reset an indicative range against which performance could be assessed, as occurred in 2015.
However, as the potential results were then impacted by the Lord Chancellor announcing a plan to review the Ogden discount rate, the Committee felt that the position was too uncertain to set a meaningful range for modelling and therefore awaited the outcome of the Ogden review.
In determining pay-out levels, the Committee carefully considered performance relative to the targets in its assessment of over or underperformance of the target.
It applied overall judgement in light of the year-end corporate performance and decided an out-turn of 10% out of the 55% available for PBT was appropriate and should be payable under this element.
In the table below, we have disclosed the target set for PBT performance.
We have expanded our description of the performance achieved against the non-financial measures to improve transparency for shareholders although some metrics remain commercially sensitive.
The bar chart illustrates the Committees assessment of the level of achievement under the AIP.
The outcomes reflect continuing strong performance during the year as discussed in the Group highlights and Chairmans statement on pages 2 to 3 and 10 to 11 respectively.
Audited Weight Target Actual Performance Achievement against Measures as a % of performance performance Assessment performance measures max award m m Maximum Target 100% 0% 60% Vesting Vesting Vesting Financial Profit before tax 55% 415.4 353.0 Below target 18% Strategic A basket of measures of ten key customer metrics 25% See narrative Above target 92% Paul Geddes 20% See narrative Below target 50% Including objective shared among all Personal Executive Committee members John Reizenstein 20% See narrative Below target 50% Executive Director Achievement under the 2016 AIP Paul Geddes 43% of maximum John Reizenstein 43% of maximum The Committee also considered performance against the gateway criteria outlined on page 98 and determined that it was appropriate to pay a bonus and that it was not necessary to reduce the payment in light of performance against these criteria.
Financial element 55% weighting As discussed above, there is no pre-set scale around the PBT target for the 2016 financial year and, in accordance with the AIP terms, the Committee determined the appropriate pay-out for the performance achieved.
Throughout 2016 our PBT performance was positive, driven by our continued investment in brand differentiation, propositions and trading capabilities, and we ended the year significantly ahead of target.
Motor and Home Own Brands, Green Flag and Direct Line for Business have all continued to grow within a competitive market.
They are all significantly favourable to target and grew year-on-year.
Overall, before the reduction in the discount rate, profit before tax would have increased 62.8m to 570.3m 2015: 507.5m reflecting improved operating profits.
This would most likely have achieved a maximum pay-out for this element.
Reported PBT for 2016, including impact of the reduction in the Ogden discount rate, is 353.0m.
Given the strong profit progress absent the Ogden rate change and the Groups resilience as the Group already reserved at a more conservative discount rate of 1.5% compared to the actual 2.5% rate, shareholders have been protected to some extent from the effects of the reduction to the Ogden discount rate.
The Committee, having considered that the Group made strong profits before the reduction and had a good capital position, determined that it was fair and reasonable that 10% out of the 55% for PBT should be payable.
88 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 88 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements The Committee understands that the Lord Chancellor, while announcing a discount rate of minus 0.75%, is launching a further consultation regarding the approach to setting the Ogden discount rate which may or may not lead to a change to the Ogden discount rate.
In these exceptional circumstances, and given that the impact of the post-year-end announcement was to reduce this element from paying out at the likely full 55% to 10%, the Committee will keep the out-turn under the 2016 AIP assessment under review until the end of 2017.
If, during 2017, in connection with the consultation, the Ogden discount rate is raised from minus 0.75%, the Committee will recalculate the out-turn for this element and adjust it accordingly: the impact of such a subsequent change in the Ogden discount rate would be excluded from the 2017 AIP.
Strategic element 25% weighting The Groups strategy is to make insurance much easier and better value for our customers.
It aims to deliver on its commitments in this area and ensure that fairness is a natural outcome of what the Group does.
Overall, performance on the customer agenda against our ten key customer metrics remains very strong and, in 2016, we introduced new metrics to monitor and assess conduct performance and complaints.
Through the year there was a strong focus on removing the reasons for customer problems with multiple initiatives delivering tangible improvement.
One such initiative was the roll-out of focused investment in customer training to our front-line staff across Home and Motor Claims which has had a positive impact on NPS and NetEase scores.
Our new approach to problem handling and recording has driven an improved customer experience and reductions in reportable complaint volumes.
Persistency and retention remained strong with some of our brands consistently outperforming the market, and we have achieved a good commercial and customer experience balance.
The Committee considered that the Company has made good progress over the past couple of years in improving the customer experience in the context that it is now becoming more challenging to improve on or maintain an already strong performance.
Having considered performance against targets and an assessment of the quality of performance achieved, the Committee agreed that the level of out-turn of 92% under this element was appropriate in order to reflect the continued strong performance in trading and customer satisfaction despite competitive market conditions.
Personal element 20% weighting This element relates to an objective that is shared with other Executive Committee members and set by the Committee.
The Committee considers the performance against this element together with the Executives personal performance and leadership over the year.
The Group remains focused on improving its digital offering, customer experience and operational efficiency.
A key focus of management was the level of change the Group has been making to its IT infrastructure.
It remains focused on adopting the right capabilities and will take the time necessary seeking to do so.
While progress has been made in each of the three areas, implementation and integration of a range of new IT systems is inherently complex and challenging.
The Group has made progress improving the performance and security of the core infrastructure during the year, supporting its people in performing their roles more reliably.
However, the Committee noted that there was less progress on delivering against the Groups IT plans than had been envisaged.
The team has reflected on the experience over the past year and will apply key learnings as it continues on this change journey in 2017.
Taking performance against each Executive Directors individual performance and the above challenges into account, the Committee determined that Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein should each receive awards of 50% respectively of the maximum available under this element.
Consequently, the annual incentive awards for Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 were as follows: Actual 000 Maximum Target Actual including cash and % of salary % of salary % of salary deferred elements Audited Paul Geddes, CEO 175% 105% 75% 594 John Reizenstein, CFO 150% 90% 65% 308 www.

It also reviewed the overall frameworks operation to make sure it is still fit for purpose.
The review concluded that the framework successfully linked Executive Directors variable pay with the Groups performance and a scorecard ensured that management are incentivised both to deliver superior financial returns and excellent customer service.
Therefore, the AIP continues to provide the most appropriate incentive.
However, to further align the Executive Directors interests with those of shareholders and the objectives of the business in 2017, the Committee decided to broaden the measures under the strategic element to encompass both customer and people targets given the good progress that has been made on customer experience, the importance of the people agenda and the fact that the Company has signed up to HM Treasurys Women in Finance Charter.
The overall weighting of 25% assigned to this element has not changed.
Please see pages 24 and 25 for a complete list of our key performance indicators and how these relate to Executive Directors remuneration.

To do this, the Committee must be satisfied that it is appropriate to permit a bonus award at all, or at a given level.
The gateway involves some subjectivity about performance.
This may result in positive or negative moderation of each AIP performance measure or the overall bonus outcome.
The list below sets out the gateway criteria for the AIP for 2017.
Gateway criteria for the AIP for 2017 outcomes for Executive Directors Year-on-year changes in profit before tax Quality and sustainability of earnings, referring to reserving, gross written premium, costs and loss ratio, and relevant lead indicators Additional customer context, for example, conduct, experience, brand and franchise health Capital strength and affordability Risk management within risk appetite The Groups relative performance to that of its peers The wider economic environment Exceptional events, such as abnormal weather Any regulatory breaches and or reputational damage to the Group Committee satisfaction that paying the bonus does not cause major reputational concerns The Committee may also use its discretion to account for additional factors.
These include the quality of financial results: the direction of travel of all measures: more widely considering reputation, risk, and audit.
In considering such factors, and whether to adjust the overall pay-outs and or operate malus and clawback, the Committee receives appropriate input from the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee through receiving reports from, and discussion with, the Chairs of those Committees.
Performance conditions for LTIP awards LTIP awards to be granted in 2017 will continue to be subject to performance against these performance conditions: 60% based on RoTE over a three-year performance period 2017, 2018 and 2019 40% based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period, starting on the date of grant.
The starting and closing TSR will be averaged over a three-month period For these purposes, we use the Groups standard definition for RoTE, subject to such other adjustments as the Committee may consider appropriate.
To find out more about how we calculate RoTE, see page 190.

For the RoTE element, 20% of the award will vest for threshold RoTE and 40% for a ROTE of 16.0% for awards to be made in March 2017.
Otherwise, vesting is similar to TSR: a straight-line interpolation occurs from threshold to target, then from target to maximum performance.
The LTIP awards will also vest only to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE performance conditions reflects the Groups underlying financial performance from the date of grant until vesting.
When considering these matters, the Committee will also consider whether there have been any material risk failings.
Pension and benefits A pension contribution of 25% of base salary will continue to be paid to the CEO and CFO in 2017.
Before his promotion to the Board the MD Personal Lines received a pension contribution of 15% of base salary and the level of contribution has not been changed following his appointment to the Board.
Benefits comprise providing a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, life assurance, income protection and health screening.

suits them The Executive Directors are eligible to receive such additional benefits as the Committee considers appropriate having regard to market norms In line with our approach to all employees, certain Group products are offered to Executive Directors at a discount Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any of the employee share plans operated by the Company, in line with HMRC guidelines where relevant and on the same basis as other eligible employees.
Currently, this includes the Share Incentive Plan SIP, which has been used to provide an award of free shares to all employees including Executive Directors, and permit employees to purchase shares with a corresponding matching award Where an Executive Director is required to relocate to perform their role, they may be offered appropriate relocation benefits.
The level of such benefits would be determined based on the circumstances of the individual and typical market practice To align the interests of Executive Directors are expected to retain all the ordinary shares vesting under any of Share Executive Directors with those the Companys share incentive plans, after any disposals for paying applicable taxes, ownership of shareholders until they have achieved the required shareholding level: unless such earlier sale, in guidelines exceptional circumstances, is permitted by the Chairman Notes to the policy table Malus and clawback Malus reducing or forfeiting unvested awards and clawback the Companys ability to claim repayment of paid amounts provisions apply to the AIP cash and deferred element and LTIP if, in the Committees opinion, any of the following has occurred: There has been a material misstatement of the Companys financial results, which has led to an overpayment The assessment of performance targets is based on an error, or inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions Circumstances warranting summary dismissal in the relevant period A material failure of risk management An event during the relevant period which has, in the view of the Committee, sufficiently and significantly impacted the Companys reputation as to justify such action Amounts in respect of awards under both plans LTIP and DAIP may be subject to clawback for up to three years post payment or vesting with such period lengthened if there is an investigation as to whether relevant circumstances exist as appropriate.
Consistent with developments in the market generally, the provisions clarify that any recoupment is out of the post-tax amount, except to the extent that the participant recovers tax from the relevant tax authority.

An annual limit of 10% of base salary per Executive Director has been set for the duration of this policy plus an additional amount of up to 100% of salary in respect of relocation expenses.
The Committee will monitor the costs in practice and ensure the overall costs do not increase by more than the Committee considers to be appropriate in all the circumstances Additionally, the limit for any employee share plans in which the Executive Directors participate will be in line with the caps permitted by HMRC from time to time The Executive Directors may be entitled to retain fees received for any directorships held outside the Group Similarly, while not benefits in the normal usage of that term, certain other items such as hospitality or retirement gifts may also be provided 200% of salary for all Executive Directors Not applicable The Committee reserves the discretion to amend these levels in future years Changes from 2014 policy The main changes from the 2014 policy are summarised below.
To aid the administration and clarity of its operation, other minor changes have also been made to the policy: For LTIP awards made after adopting the new policy at the 2017 AGM, Executive Directors will be subject to an additional two-year holding period following the three-year vesting period, during which time awards may not normally be exercised or released Consistent with GC100 guidance, the cap to base salary has been re-expressed as a fixed monetary amount.
Please note that this is simply to align with reporting guidance and the cap does not represent any form of aspiration Adding a cap on providing relocation benefits Exercise of discretion In line with market practice, the Committee retains discretion relating to operating and administering the AIP, DAIP and LTIP.
This discretion includes, but is not limited to: the timing of awards and payments: the size of awards, within the overall limits disclosed in the policy table: the determination of vesting: the treatment of awards in the case of change of control or restructuring: the treatment of leavers within the rules of the plan, and the termination policy shown on page 107: and adjustments needed in certain circumstances, for example, a rights issue, corporate restructuring or special interim dividend.
While performance conditions will generally remain unchanged once set, the Committee has the usual discretions to amend the measures, weightings and targets in exceptional circumstances such as a major transaction where the original conditions would cease to operate as intended.
Any such changes would be explained in the subsequent annual remuneration report and, if appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
Consistent with best practice, the LTIP rules also provide that any such amendment must not make, in the view of the Committee, the amended condition materially less difficult to satisfy than the original condition was intended to be before such event occurred.
com 103 Directors remuneration report continued Adjusting the number of shares under deferred bonus and LTIP The number of shares subject to deferred bonus and LTIP awards may be increased to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid in respect of any dates falling between the grant of awards and the date of vesting or, if later, the expiry of any holding period of awards legacy awards made before 2014 accrue dividends to exercise.
The terms of incentive plan awards may be adjusted in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital, demerger or a similar event that materially affects the price of the shares, or otherwise in accordance with the plan rules.
Remuneration payments agreed before appointment to the Board The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including, where relevant, exercising any discretions available to it connected with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before 13 May 2014 the date the original shareholder approved policy came into effect : ii provided the terms of the payment were consistent with any shareholder-approved Directors remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed: iii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Direct Line Insurance Group plc and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes, payments include pension arrangements and the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration.
Relating to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Selecting performance measures Annual Incentive Plan The Committee has selected the AIP performance measures to incentivise Executive Directors to achieve financial targets for the year, and specific strategic, shared and personal objectives.
These measures are aligned with the key performance indicators we use as a business to monitor performance against our strategic priorities, as shown on pages 24 and 25.
The relevant targets are set at or following the start of each year to ensure the Executive Directors focus appropriately on the key objectives for the next twelve months.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders.
Therefore, for 2017 as in prior years, awards under the LTIP will continue to be subject to performance against RoTE an important KPI to the business and relative TSR targets.
The Committee believes this combination provides a balanced approach to measuring Group performance over the longer term by using a stated financial KPI that incentivises individuals to keep growing the business efficiently, and a measure based on relative shareholder return.
This combination of measures appropriately balances absolute and relative returns.
As set out in the policy table, different performance measures may apply for awards granted in future years.
Differences in remuneration policy from broader employee population To ensure that the arrangements in place remain appropriate, when determining Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee accounts for pay throughout the Group.
The Group has one consistent reward policy for all levels of employees.
Therefore, the same reward principles guide reward decisions for all Group employees, including Executive Directors.
However, remuneration packages differ to account for appropriate factors in different areas of the business: AIP approximately 3,600 employees participate in the AIP.
The corporate performance measures for all employees are consistent with those used for Executive Directors, although the weighting attributable to those factors may differ.
The Groups strategic leaders approximately 60 employees also receive part of their bonus in Company shares deferred for three years Incentive awards approximately 3,800 employees, excluding Executive Directors, participate in a function or team specific incentive plan which assesses personal performance over a monthly period.
These incentive awards may pay out monthly or quarterly LTIP our strategic leaders participate in the LTIP, currently based on the same performance conditions as those for Executive Directors RSP RSP awards are used on a limited basis across the Company to help recruit and retain critical staff, and for talent management.
Executive Directors do not receive grants under the RSP All employee share plans the Committee considers it important for all employees to have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company.
The HMRC-approved SIP has operated since 2013, and, in addition, the Company has made periodic awards of free shares.
At year-end, approximately 3,000 employees throughout the Group had signed up to these schemes with 9,500 holding free shares in the Company Pension and benefits depending on employee grade, the Company contributes between 9-25% to the defined contribution pension scheme without any requirement for an employee contribution.
Employees may also opt for a proportion or all of this to be paid as cash rather than into the pension scheme 104 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 104 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors Element Purpose and link to strategy Approach to setting fees and cap Other items Chairman and To enable the Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic annual fee.

It is the Committees view that expenses which are deemed to be benefits are covered under the aggregate cap set by the Articles of Association and that this cap is not restricted to fees only Similarly, while not benefits in the normal usage of that term, certain other items such as hospitality or retirement gifts may also be provided Fee levels for Non-Executive Directors are reviewed and may be increased at appropriate intervals by the Board, with affected individual Directors absenting themselves from deliberations In setting the level of fees, the Company accounts for the roles expected time commitment, and fees at other companies of a similar size, sector and or complexity to the Group Fees including expenses which are deemed to be benefits for Non-Executive Directors are subject to an aggregate cap in the Articles of Association currently 2,000,000 per annum.
The Company reserves the right to change how the elements and weightings within the overall fees are paid, and to pay a proportion of the fees in shares within this limit Recruitment remuneration policy To strengthen the management team and secure the skills to deliver the Groups strategic aims, the recruitment remuneration policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high-calibre executives.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to look to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in the policy table, and structure a package in accordance with that policy.
Consistent with the Regulations, the caps contained in the policy table for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these caps in practice 2.
The Company would normally disclose clearly the terms of any recruitment package on announcing the appointment of any new Executive Director 3.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment, as appropriate 4.
For external and internal appointments including a major change in role, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses, legal and other fees involved in negotiating any recruitment, or pay expatriate benefits in line with the policy table, as appropriate www.
com 105 Directors remuneration report continued Buy-out awards 5.
Where it is necessary to make a recruitment-related pay award to an external candidate, the Company will not pay more than necessary, in the view of the Committee, and will in all cases seek to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing incentive pay structure 6.
All such awards for external appointments, whether under the AIP, LTIP or otherwise, to compensate for awards forfeited on leaving their previous employer will be determined taking into account the commercial value of the amount forfeited, and the nature, time horizons and performance requirements of those awards.
In particular, the Committees starting point will be to ensure that any awards being forfeited which remain subject to outstanding performance requirements other than where substantially complete are bought out with replacement requirements, and any awards with service requirements are bought out with similar terms.
However, exceptionally, the Committee may relax those obligations where it considers it to be in the interests of shareholders and those factors are, in the Committees view, equally reflected in some other way, for example through a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited The elements of any package for a new recruit, including the maximum level of variable pay, but excluding buy-outs, will be consistent with the Executive Directors remuneration policy described in this report, as modified by the above statement of principles where appropriate.
The Committee reserves the right to avail itself of the current Listing Rule 9.4.
2 being the rule which permits exceptional recruitment awards on terms different from any shareholder approved ongoing plans if needed to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, recruiting an Executive Director.
Awards granted under this provision will only be used for buy-out awards.
Any commitments made before promotion to the Board except when made in connection with the appointment to the Board can continue to be honoured under the policy, even if they are not consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled.
In exceptional circumstances, the initial notice period may be longer than the Companys 12-month policy up to a maximum of 24 months.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until it has reduced to 12 months in line with the Companys policy position.
The remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as set out earlier in this report will apply relating to any recruitments to those positions.
Service contracts Subject to the discretion noted above for new recruits, it is the Companys policy to set notice periods for Executive Directors of no more than 12 months both by the Director or Company.
The Executive Directors service agreements summary is as follows: Notice period by Director Effective date of contract Director or Company Exit payment policy Paul Geddes 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case, instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
John Reizenstein 1 September 2012 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period to be paid in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case, instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
Mike Holliday- 30 January 2014 12 months Base salary only for unexpired portion of notice period to be paid Williams in a lump sum or monthly instalments, in which case, instalments are subject to mitigation if an alternative role is found.
There are no further obligations which could give rise to a remuneration or loss of office payment other than those set out in the remuneration policy table and the termination policy overleaf.
106 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 106 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Termination policy It is appropriate for the Committee to retain discretion to consider the termination terms of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time.
A Director is deemed a good leaver if the following circumstances are met: AIP and LTIP death, injury, ill-health, redundancy, retirement, the sale of the individuals employing company or business out of the Group, or in such other circumstances as the Committee determines DAIP for any reason other than summary dismissal or resignation.
However, the Committee may determine that, in the case of resignation only, awards may be retained The table below sets out the general position.
However, it should be noted that the Committee, consistent with most other companies, has reserved a broad discretion to determine whether an Executive Director should be categorised as a good leaver, and that discretion forms part of the approved policy.
If a leaver is a bad leaver, for example leaving through If a leaver is deemed to be Other events, for example, Incentives resignation or summary dismissal a good leaver change in control of Company Annual Incentive Plan No awards made Bonus based on performance, Bonus determined on such basis paid at the normal time and as the Committee considers on a time pro-rata basis, unless appropriate and paid on a the Committee determines time pro-rata basis, unless the otherwise Committee determines otherwise Deferred Annual All awards will lapse Deferred shares typically vest Awards will vest in full Incentive Plan on the normal vesting date, In the event of a demerger or although the Committee reserves similar event, the Committee may discretion to accelerate vesting.

Their rights to a statutory redundancy payment are not affected.
Depending on the circumstances of departure, an Executive Director may have additional claims under relevant employment protection laws, and the Company may contribute to any legal fees involved in agreeing a termination.
It may also agree to incur certain other expenses such as providing outplacement services.
Any such fees would be disclosed as part of the detail of any termination arrangements.
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments connected with a Directors cessation of office or employment, where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of a compromise or settlement of any claim arising connected with the cessation of a Directors office or employment.
com 107 Directors remuneration report continued Non-Executive Director letters of appointment Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term which may be extended by mutual agreement.
In common with the Executive Directors, all Non-Executives are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Directors may appoint additional members to join the Board during the year.
Directors appointed in this way will be subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment.
In subsequent years, the Directors must submit themselves for re-election at each AGM.
Terms and conditions of appointment of all the Directors are available for anyone to inspect at the Companys registered office and AGM.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have notice periods of three months from either party which do not apply in the case of a Director not being re-elected by shareholders or retiring from office under the Articles of Association.
Other than fees for this notice period, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on exit.
External directorships The Company encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the Chairmans approval, an invitation to join the board of another company outside the Group in a non-executive capacity, recognising the value of such wider experience.
In these circumstances, they are permitted to retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment.
Executive Directors are generally limited to accepting one external directorship, but may accept more with the Chairmans prior approval.
Considering employment conditions elsewhere in the Group As explained elsewhere in the Directors remuneration report, the Committee reviews the overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the wider Group, and, therefore, takes into account pay and conditions in the wider Group in determining the Directors remuneration policy and the remuneration payable to Directors.
Through the Chief Executive Officer, Paul Geddes, and other senior management, the Committee may receive input from employee groups in the Group, such as the Employee Representative Body, as required.
In accordance with prevailing commercial practice, the Committee did not consult with employees in preparing the Directors remuneration policy.
Considering shareholders views The Committee accounts for the approval levels of remuneration related matters at the AGM in determining whether the current Directors remuneration policy remains appropriate.
When setting the remuneration policy, the Committee, consistent with its approach of operating within the highest standards of corporate governance, takes significant account of guidelines issued by the leading shareholder and proxy agencies.
The Committee also seeks to build an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally, and particularly, any changes to the Companys executive pay arrangements.
The Committee is satisfied that no element of the Directors remuneration policy conflicts with the Groups approach to environmental, social or corporate governance matters.
108 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 108 Direct Line Group Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Performance scenarios The Directors remuneration policy has been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is delivered as variable pay and, therefore, depends on performance against our strategic objectives.
The Committee has considered the level of remuneration that may be paid under different performance scenarios to ensure it would be appropriate in each situation, in the context of the performance delivered and the value created for shareholders.
The following charts show the potential remuneration which Executive Directors may earn under three performance scenarios assuming the adoption of the proposed Policy as set out below.
These exclude share price appreciation and dividends which could have a significant impact on the final outcome.

The Groups insurance reserves total 4.7bn 2015: 4.5bn.
The determination of the value of the insurance reserves requires significant judgment in the selection of key methodologies and assumptions.
Small changes in these methodologies or assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities.
We have identified the following two key areas of focus for our audit: 1 The frequency and severity of excess bodily injury claims: and 2 The propensity, severity and discount rate assumptions for valuing PPOs.

Key observations: We have determined that the estimate for the ultimate value of large bodily claims to be within a reasonable range.
We observed that the frequency and severity assumptions were set towards the prudent end of a reasonable range.
