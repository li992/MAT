co. uk 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 04 Directors remuneration report What performance means for Executive Directors pay At Prudential, remuneration packages are designed to ensure a strong alignment between pay and performance.
As you can see from the charts on page 111, sustained growth across all of our key performance metrics has delivered substantial value to our shareholders.
This has been reflected in both the annual bonuses paid and the release of long-term incentive awards, as set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
In particular, the long-term incentives awarded to Executive Directors in 2014 had stretching performance conditions attached to vesting and were denominated in shares or ADRs.
The value generated for shareholders through share price growth and dividends paid over the last three years is therefore reflected in the value of the LTIP releases.
The value of these performance-related elements of remuneration are added to the fixed packages provided to Executive Directors to calculate the 2016 single figure of total remuneration.
The total 2016 single figure for the Group Chief Executive is lower than the total 2015 single figure, despite continuing strong business performance.
This is chiefly a result of a lower level of vesting of the 2014 PLTIP award.
Mike Wellss 2016 single figure is 30 per cent less than his 2015 single figure, notwithstanding his exceptional leadership and personal performance.
The remuneration above was paid in respect of his service as an Executive Director, other than the LTIP releases which related to his previous role.
2 Anne Richards was appointed to the Board on 7 June 2016.
The remuneration above was paid in respect of her service as an Executive Director.

Aligning 2017 pay to performance The Remuneration Committee awarded salary increases to the Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive, M&G and the Group Chief Risk Officer, for 2017 of 2 per cent, which was below the salary increase budget for the wider workforce.
The Chief Executive, M&G, was appointed during the year and therefore no increase in salary was proposed.
The Remuneration Committee awarded a salary increase for 2017 of 5 per cent to the Group Chief Risk Officer to reflect her performance and contribution.
When Penny was promoted to the Board in 2015 her salary was lower than that of her predecessor.
No other changes have been made as we believe remuneration packages remain strongly aligned with performance over both the short and the long term.
The resultant remuneration packages for 2017 are set out in detail in the Annual report on remuneration and summarised below: AIP Maximum 2017 bonus Bonus LTI award Executive Director Role salary % salary deferred % salary John Foley Chief Executive, UK & Europe 765,000 180% 40% 250% Penny James Group Chief Risk Officer 637,000 160% 40% 250% 1 Anne Richards Chief Executive, M&G 400,000 600% 40% 450% Nic Nicandrou Chief Financial Officer 726,000 175% 40% 250% 2 Barry Stowe Chairman & CEO, NABU US$1,134,000 160% 40% 460% Mike Wells Group Chief Executive 1,103,000 200% 40% 400% Tony Wilkey Chief Executive, PCA HK$9,070,000 180% 40% 250% Notes 1 The bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive, M&G remains the lower of 0.75 per cent of M&Gs IFRS profit or six times salary.

All future awards will be made under the PLTIP.
