worked with us and also supported these Policy changes together with our Annual Report on Remuneration.
I would further add that post the AGM, much of the Committees work during the remainder of the year has centred on overseeing the systematic implementation of that Policy.
The wider picture The second half of 2016 has also seen a continuation of the debate on executive remuneration as exemplified by the launch of the Governments inquiry into business practices and corporate governance.
This includes in its remit an examination of executive pay and the roles and responsibilities that both company boards and shareholders have to play.
We have responded to the initial CBI feedback on this topic and have actively contributed to a number of roundtable discussions on the Green Paper, including the GC100 Conference: Corporate Governance, Business and Society.
We look forward to further engagement once the Governments ideas and proposals have been formulated, being mindful of the need for transparency in disclosure of remuneration but with a positive emphasis on simplicity rather than on regulation which might be complex and burdensome to implement and open to interpretation and ambiguity which runs counter to the concept of transparency.
48 British American Tobacco Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Remuneration Report Summary Our Remuneration Policy 2016 The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Directors applicable in 2016 was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2016.
It is set out in full in the Future Policy Table for Executive Directors and the Remuneration Table for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in the Remuneration Report 2015 contained in the Annual Report 2015 on www.
We have summarised the key elements below to facilitate the understanding of the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016 pages 5676 of this Remuneration Report 2016 as set out below.
Our principles of remuneration summary The Committees remuneration principles seek to reward the delivery of the Groups strategy in a simple and straightforward manner which is aligned to shareholders long-term sustainable interests.
The remuneration structure comprises fixed and variable elements.
These rewards are structured and designed to be both transparent and stretching while recognising the skills and experience of the Executive Directors and ensuring a market competitiveness for talent.
The fixed elements comprise base salary, pension and other benefits: the variable elements are provided via two performance-based incentive schemes asingle cash and share incentive annual bonus plan IEIS, and a single long-term incentive scheme LTIP.
In applying these principles, the Committee maintains an appropriate balance between fixed pay and the opportunity to earn performancerelated remuneration with the performance-based elements forming, at maximum opportunity, between 75% and 85% of the Executive Directors total remuneration.
An annual review is conducted to ensure application and alignment of the Policy with the business needs to promote the long-term success of the Company.
How each key element of our remuneration supports the strategic priorities Fixed remuneration: attract and retain high calibre individuals to deliver the Companys strategic plans by offering market base salary competitive levels of guaranteed cash to reflect an individuals skills, experience and role within pension the Company: benefits provide competitive post-retirement benefit arrangements which recognise both the individuals length of tenure with the Group and the external environment in the context of attracting and retaining senior high calibre individuals to deliver the Groups strategy: and provide market competitive benefits consistent with role which: 1 help to facilitate the attraction and retention of high calibre, senior individuals to deliver the Companys strategic plans: and 2 recognise that such talent is global in source and that the availability of certain benefits e. g. relocation, repatriation, taxation compliance advice will from time to time be necessary to avoid such factors being an inhibitor to accepting the role.
Variable remuneration: incentivise the attainment of corporate targets aligned to the strategic objectives of the Company on an short-term incentives annual basis: performance-based award in the form of cash and deferred shares, so that the latter element ensures alignment with shareholders long-term interests: strong alignment and linkage between individual and corporate annual objectives via the application of an individual performance adjustment factor to the corporate result: and ensure, overall, a market-competitive package to attract and retain high calibre individuals to deliver the Groups strategy.
Variable remuneration: incentivise long-term sustainable growth in total shareholder return TSR, adjusted diluted earnings long-term incentives per share EPS and net turnover NTO, together with the achievement of a consistently high measure of operating cash flow to operating profit conversion ratio over a three-year period: to facilitate the appointment of high calibre, senior individuals required to deliver the Companys strategic plans: and to promote the long-term success of the Company: and to put in place a combination of measures with appropriately stretching targets around the long-term plan that provides a balance relevant to the Companys business and market conditions, as well as providing alignment between Executive Directors and shareholders.
In setting performance criteria and thresholds targets, the Committee takes account of the Groups long-term plans and market expectations.

TSR: this is measured according to the return index calculated by Datastream and has been reviewed by the Committees remuneration consultants.
It is measured on the basis that all the Companys dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares.

Review By Remuneration Committee in February 2017 on basis of an internal report augmented by an assessment by the Groups external auditors of the relevant calculations.
Payout Determined by actual performance for each measure, relative to that measures performance points.
Discretion The Remuneration Committee is able to override a proposed pay-out in circumstances where, in its judgement, the overall performance of the Company justifies a different outcome, whether higher or lower than that determined by the bonus formula.
Individual performance element Awarded for Outstanding performance, by adjusting upwards by up to 20% of the annual corporate IEIS result subject to the applicable maximum award limit: paid in cash.
Individual performance rated as Requires Improvement results in the corporate IEIS result being reduced by 50%.
The Committee also reviews the personal performance of each Executive Director against their operational and strategic measures, which are agreed at the start of the year and which depend on the priorities for each Directors area of responsibility, in the context of the delivery of the Group strategy.
IEIS performance review presentation of outcomes Bonus targets and results 2015 and 2016 The Remuneration Committee considers annually the question of commercial confidentiality and the sensitivity of bonus targets and results.
This review is considered against a background of the Group operating in a highly consolidated industry and being the second largest tobacco company in the world outside China with its two key competitors the largest and third largest global tobacco companies not subject to the same regulatory disclosures.
Specific performance measures, their weightings and actual performance results achieved in 2016 are disclosed.
The specific performance targets for each measure are considered to be commercially sensitive.
The Committee considers that its competitors would gain significant commercial insights into the Groups specific objectives and key priorities for its brands and markets if actual targets were disclosed year on year: such disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The specific performance targets for each measure will only be disclosed retrospectively, at the earliest, in the Annual Report on Remuneration which relates to the period of 12 months after the end of the relevant IEIS performance period.
The Committee has therefore agreed to disclose the specific Threshold and Maximum targets for the IEIS performance period ended 31 December 2015.
These are shown in the following table.
It is expected that the specific Threshold and Maximum targets for the IEIS performance period ended 31 December 2016 will be published in March 2018 in the Annual Report for 2017.

LTIP Extended Vesting Period: there is an additional vesting period of two years from the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The LTIP award will vest only to the extent that: 1 the performance conditions or measures are satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period: 2 an additional vesting period of two years from the date of the third anniversary of the date of grant has been completed i. e. the LTIP Extended Vesting Period.
The LTIP award is therefore only exercisable once the total period of five years from the date of grant has been completed.

Executive Directors Nicandro Durante Ben Stevens All-employee share schemes: Sharesave Scheme Share Incentive Plan Partnership Scheme Share Incentive Plan Share Reward Scheme Percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration The following table shows the percentage change in the Chief Executives remuneration measured against a comparator group comprising the 1 UK employee population on UK employment contracts 2016: 2,022 individuals: 2015: 1,971 individuals.
This comparator group is considered to be the most appropriate group as Executive Directors are employed on UK contracts.
Using a more widely drawn group encompassing the worldwide nature of the Groups business would also present practical difficulties in collation as well as presenting a less relevant comparator given the significant variations in employee pay across the Group and the differing economic conditions and wide variations in GDP per capita.
The data for the 2015 comparator has been updated to reflect actual individual employee numbers and costs in 2015.
The data for this comparator group is made up as follows as at 31 December 2016: 1 the weighted average base salaries: 2 the average taxable benefits per grade: and 3 an estimated weighted average target bonus based on that population as at that date.
UK-based employees were awarded performance-based pay increases in the range 0% to 8% with an average of around 3%.

These changes are described in detail in the Remuneration Report 2015 in the context of three principal discussion themes: 1 a current LTIP thatdid not function effectively to incentivise and reward management to drive the strategic fundamentals was not in the interests of shareholders: 2 measured over several years, the Companys underlying performance had remained extremely strong: and 3 a need to increase the award potential for Executive Directors to ensure competitiveness in the market.
