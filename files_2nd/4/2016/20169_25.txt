T Target E Expectation Some expectations are not disclosed as they are commercially sensitive.
Consistent with last year, the Board set expectations rather than targets for some metrics.
This is because the timing of acquisitions and disposals is highly sensitive to market conditions, and a more prescriptive approach would run the risk of creating perverse incentives for executives.
For example, to achieve a target level of realisations may result in the earlier sale of assets than would otherwise be appropriate, or to achieve a target level of investments may result in investing at inated prices.
In practice, the Boards expectations in these areas were met or exceeded in each case.
In light of the achievements detailed above, and the exceptional performance of the Group in the year, the Committee awarded Mr Borrows a bonus in respect of FY2016 of 2,158,932 being 92.5% of his maximum bonus opportunity, and awarded Mrs Wilson a bonus in respect of FY2016 of 901,765 being 85% of her maximum bonus opportunity.
In each case, 20% of the award will be paid in cash immediately, 20% will be delivered as shares with a retention period of six months and the remaining 60% will be deferred into the Companys shares vesting in equal instalments over four years.
Annual bonus awards are subject to the malus and clawback policy.
