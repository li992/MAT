It explains the purpose and strategy of each element of the package and demonstrates how the policy will incentivise Executive Directors to achieve sustainable long-term growth and value that will best serve the interests of the Company, its shareholders, its employees and its customers.
Our Directors remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 1 May 2014 and became effective for three years from that date.
The policy outlined below is a new policy for the three years from 2017 and will be put to a binding vote of shareholders at the AGM to be held on 19 May 2017.
A resolution to amend the PSP rules to increase the normal and exceptional limits will also be presented at the AGM.

Proposed change for 2017 policy vote The current policy provides for PSP awards of 90% of salary for the Chief Executive and 70% of salary for the other Executive Directors, with awards of up to 120% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
It is proposed that the revised policy will allow for awards of up to 115% of salary for the Chief Executive and 95% of salary for the other Executive Directors.
Awards in exceptional circumstances will be limited to 150% of salary.
The Committee believes that the revised award levels are required to ensure that the policy is fit-for-purpose for the next policy cycle and ensure that Executives Directors are appropriately incentivised to deliver and drive the business forward and rewarded for success.

They are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses and tax thereon.
They may also receive limited travel or accommodation related benefits in connection with their role as a Director.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 59 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Difference in remuneration policy across the Group The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed having regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole.
There are differences in salary levels and in the levels of potential reward depending upon seniority and responsibility, although a key reference point for executive salary increases is the average increase across the general workforce.
A higher proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration package is delivered through performance-related pay and in share-based form, which provide a good link to long-term Company performance.
All colleagues, with one-years service or more, may participate in the SAYE scheme and in the Share Incentive Plan SIP that are run annually.
Under the SAYE scheme, at the end of a three-year saving period, colleagues can buy Greggs shares at a discounted rate.
With the SIP, all colleagues may purchase Company shares from pre-tax salary subject to HMRC limits.
After six months service all colleagues are eligible to participate in the profit-sharing scheme in which all colleagues share 10 per cent of our profits.
Policy discretion The Committee will operate incentive plans in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the HMRC limits where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plan rules.
These include but are not limited to the following: who participates: the timing of the grant of award and or payment: the size of an award up to plan policy limits and or a payment: discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes and the treatment of leavers: adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any of these payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Policy on recruitment remuneration The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Directors remuneration package in line with the Companys approved policy at the time of appointment.
The Committee will take into account, in arriving at a total package and in considering the quantum for each element of the package, the skills and experience of the candidate, the market rate for a candidate of that experience as well as the importance of securing the best available candidate.
Annual bonus and PSP awards will not exceed the policy maxima not including any arrangements to replace forfeited deferred pay.
Participation in the annual bonus plan and PSP will normally be pro-rated for the year of joining.
The Committee may make one-off additional cash and or share-based awards as it deems appropriate, and if the circumstances so demand to take account of deferred pay forfeited by an Executive Director on leaving a previous employer.
Awards to replace deferred pay forfeited would, where possible, reflect the nature of awards forfeited in terms of delivery mechanism cash or shares, time horizons, attributed expected value and performance conditions.
Other payments may be made in relation to relocation expenses and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
Any buyout awards would be made under existing arrangements where possible or as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms and any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment would continue.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy at that time.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 60 Directors Report Service contracts and policy on cessation Executive Directors service contracts contain the following remuneration-related aspects: Provision Detailed terms Remuneration Salary, pension and benefits: company car or cash allowance: private medical health care for the Director: permanent health insurance: participation in annual bonus and profit share subject to scheme rules : participation in long-term incentive schemes or similar arrangements subject to scheme rules : and life assurance.
Notice period Chief Executives contract is terminable on 12 months notice served by either the Company or the Director: other Executive Directors service contracts are terminable on 12 months notice served by the Company or by six months notice served by the Director: and any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Termination payment Payment in lieu of notice equal to any unexpired notice of termination given by either party: and payment in lieu shall not include: any bonus payment: any payment in respect of benefits which the Director would have been entitled to receive: and any payment in respect of any holiday entitlement that would have accrued during the period for which the payment in lieu is made.
Details of the circumstances in which the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion with regards to termination payments are set out below.
The Companys policy is that current Executive Directors service contracts do not have a specific duration but may be terminated with 12 months notice from the Company and six months notice from the Executive Director.
Any future Executive Directors service contracts will be terminable on 12 months notice served by either party.
Under their service contracts the Executive Directors are entitled to salary, pension contributions and benefits for their notice period save where a payment in lieu is to be made.
The Company would seek to ensure that any payment is mitigated by use of phased payments and offset against earnings elsewhere in the event that an Executive Director finds alternative employment during his notice period.
There are no contractual provisions in force other than those set out above that impact any termination payment.
Areas where the Committee can exercise discretion with regards to termination payments: annual bonus may be payable pro-rated for that part of the year worked: deferred bonus shares must normally be retained in trust until the end of their two-year holding period and will be subject to recovery and withholding in the event of misstatement of performance, error or misconduct, where this has led to an overpayment in the view of the Committee for a period of three years from the payment date: any unvested awards held under the PSP will lapse at cessation, unless the individual is leaving in good leaver circumstances defined under the plan as death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, his office or employment being with either a company which ceases to be a Group member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group member, a change of control or any other reason the Committee so decides.
In these circumstances, unvested awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date other than on death or where the Committee decides they should vest at cessation subject to performance conditions being met and scaling back in respect of actual service as a proportion of the total vesting period unless the Committee decides that scaling back is inappropriate.
Vested awards will normally be subject to the mandatory two-year holding period although the Committee will have discretion to waive this in exceptional circumstances: and the Committee may agree to payment of disbursements such as legal costs and outplacement services if appropriate and depending on the circumstances of cessation.
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors service contracts: Director Date of contract Roger Whiteside 4 February 2013 Raymond Reynolds 18 December 2006 Richard Hutton 7 April 2006 The service contracts are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Companys registered office, and are available for inspection at the AGM.

We have undertaken a formal consultation with our largest shareholders this year as part of our extensive review of our remuneration policy, the majority of whom were supportive and we would welcome feedback from shareholders on any issue related to executive remuneration.
As a result, shareholders will be asked to approve our new policy report at the AGM in 2017.
We will continue to engage with shareholders to understand any concerns they may have about our policy and its implementation during the life of the new policy.
The following table sets out the votes from shareholders that the Directors remuneration report received at the 2016 AGM: Approve the remuneration report Total number of votes % of votes cast For 65,363,035 99.73% Against 180,238 0.27% Total votes cast excluding votes withheld 65,543,273 100% Votes withheld 170,158 Total votes cast including votes withheld 65,713,431 Votes withheld are not included in the final proxy figures as they are not recognised as a vote in law.

On target performance will deliver a bonus of 46% of maximum.
Bonus in excess of 50% of maximum will be payable in shares deferred for two years.
Executive Directors Maximum opportunity of 90% of base salary.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 64 Directors Report The bonus metrics are: Profit Sales Strategic objectives 50% of total 20% of total 30% of total This will be based on meeting and Based on company-managed shop like-forDetailed below exceeding budget for the year like sales excluding any additional shops opened during the bonus year The strategic objectives for each bonus cycle will be based on measures which will provide a strong link to future value creation.
For the 2017 bonus the three strategic objectives, each relating to 10 per cent of the bonus opportunity, will be: i.
Specific project delivery within our change programme regarding processes and systems with three elements measured independently: one element being worth five per cent and two elements being worth 2.5 per cent each.
Specific project delivery within our programme for supply chain restructuring with three elements measured independently: one element being worth five per cent and two elements being worth 2.5 per cent each.
The annual bonus is based on performance against a range of financial and strategic performance measures.
This range of metrics measures achievement of the Companys key operational objectives.
The Committee reviews the key performance indicators KPIs each year and varies them as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.
Where appropriate a sliding scale of targets is set for each KPI to encourage continuous improvement, or sustained high levels of performance.
There will be an underpin to the sales and strategic objectives elements of the bonus whereby any payment under these elements may be scaled back potentially to zero at the discretion of the Committee, in the event that the profit performance for the year is judged to be running significantly below that required for the achievement of the long-term strategy.
Bonus targets for the forthcoming year are considered to be commercially sensitive and so have not been disclosed.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be made in next years annual report on remuneration.
PSP award 2017 PSP awards will be granted as follows: Chief Executive 115% of base salary Executive Directors 95% of base salary Performance conditions will be based on an equal split of two different financial measures, EPS and ROCE for discrete parts of an award.
The Committee took into consideration the increased award levels for 2017 and this has been reflected in the targets that have been set for each metric which also reflect the strategic plan and business outlook over the performance period.
Consequently, the EPS and ROCE ranges have been increased to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in light of our business strategy without encouraging undue risk taking.
For the 2017 awards the target ranges will be as follows: The EPS performance condition will require average annual growth of EPS of five per cent to 11 per cent over three financial years measured from the 2016 financial year end.
The ROCE condition will require average annual ROCE over the three-year performance period 2017, 2018 and 2019 to be in the range 23 per cent to 27 per cent.
In both cases 25 per cent of an award will vest on achieving threshold performance and thereafter straight-line sliding scales will apply until stretch performance is achieved.
In order to improve alignment of interest between Executive Directors and shareholders further, a holding period will be attached to vested PSP awards granted in the policy period, requiring the vested shares to be held net of tax and other deductions for a further two years.
EPS and ROCE are measured excluding exceptional items.
Greggs plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 65 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED How our remuneration policy will be implemented in 2017 Non-Executive Directors In order to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding his her own remuneration, the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are set, after consultation with the Chairman, by a committee of the Board consisting only of the Executive Directors.
The fees payable to the Chairman are set by the Remuneration Committee.
The fees for Non-Executive Directors increased by 2.5 per cent on 1 January 2017 in line with the base award for our whole workforce in 2017.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual base fee which is currently 43,424 and additional responsibility fees of 6,456 for the role of Senior Independent Director SID or for chairing a Board Committee.
Where the SID role is combined with the role of chairing a Committee then only one fee of 6,456 will be paid.
Details of the fees being paid to Non-Executive Directors in 2017 are set out below: Ian Durant 163,244 Chairman Allison Kirkby 49,880 Chair of the Audit Committee Helena Ganczakowski 43,424 Non-Executive Director Peter McPhillips 43,424 Non-Executive Director Sandra Turner 49,880 SID & Chair of the Remuneration Committee Non-Executive Directors are appointed subject to the Companys articles of association, retiring and seeking election at the first AGM after appointment.
Thereafter, every Director will be subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The Nominations Committee advises the Board as to whether Directors should be nominated for re-election.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for early termination of their appointments prior to the date on which they would next be due to offer themselves for election or re-election, or if not re-appointed at such time.
The following table shows the effective date of appointment for each Non-Executive Director: Original date of appointment Ian Durant 5 October 2011 Allison Kirkby 30 January 2013 Helena Ganczakowski 2 January 2014 Peter McPhillips 10 March 2014 Sandra Turner 1 May 2014 Non-Executive Directors are appointed on an understanding that the appointment will last for six years, but without any commitment by either party.
How our remuneration policy was implemented in 2016 audited Single remuneration figure 2016 The following table presents the remuneration payable for 2016 showing the equivalent figures for 2015 for the Executive Directors: Pension contribution Annual incentives including salary including profit Long-term Total 1 Salary in lieu Taxable benefits share incentives remuneration Roger Whiteside 2016 521,135 117,255 12,408 564,780 856,291 2,071,869 2015 507,188 114,118 12,397 594,043 1,234,447 2,462,193 Richard Hutton 2016 297,702 30,582 15,298 232,297 380,452 956,331 2015 289,736 37,233 13,659 244,334 448,753 1,033,715 Raymond Reynolds 2016 265,641 32,680 14,833 207,280 339,484 859,918 2015 258,530 31,804 13,949 218,019 400,422 922,724 1 The 2016 long-term incentive vesting values are based on the forecast value of the awards due to vest on 17 March 2017 50 per cent of the award is based on EPS performance measured over the three financial years to 31 December 2016 and 50 per cent of the award is based on average annual ROCE measured over the three years to 31 December 2016.
The EPS performance measured to 31 December 2016 exceeded the maximum performance conditions and 100 per cent of this part of the award is due to vest and forms part of the 2016 long-term incentive value.
Average annual ROCE for the three years to 2016 exceeded the maximum performance requirement and 100 per cent of this part of the award is due to vest and forms part of the 2016 long-term incentive award.
The share price for the purposes of valuing the award is the three-month average share price to 31 December 2016 9.4942.
This value will be trued up in the 2017 report to reflect the actual level of vesting and share price at the vesting date.
The 2015 long-term incentive value has been restated and reflects the actual value of the awards that vested in March 2016.
Share price appreciation over the performance period to 31 December 2016 contributed materially to the total remuneration figure for 2015 and 2016.
Details can be found in the tables on page 68.

We set this metric with a sliding scale from a trigger point up to the maximum 10 per cent.
This element of our bonus plan has delivered the full 10 per cent as a result of the maximum being exceeded by 0.85 per cent.
