Governance Report Directors Remuneration Report Annual Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman At the start of the year there was considerable uncertainty regarding the retail environment and to a large extent performance expectations had been reset across the UK grocery sector.
The Committee firmly believes in pay for Mary Harris, performance and the targets set for 2015 16 were demanding in the context Chairman, of this challenging and competitive retail environment.
The Committee notes Remuneration the year-on-year reduction in profit and like-for-like sales.
However, the results Committee for 2015 16 represent a good outcome, demonstrated by maintaining market share as measured by Kantar, the outperformance of both internal and external forecasts as well as outperformance of our main supermarket peers.
Annual bonus The Executive Directors bonus assessed performance against profit, sales, customer and individual measures.
During the year the Company made good progress against these metrics and as such the bonus paid out at 76 per cent of maximum for Mike Coupe and 78 per cent of maximum for John Rogers.
In a move towards greater transparency and consistent with best practice, in this years report, expanded retrospective disclosure has been provided regarding both the bonus outcomes and the targets set see page 71.
I hope this provides useful additional insight into the decision making process.
Dear Shareholder, Deferred Share Award DSA Reflecting the Companys significant outperformance of the target for sales and profit, strong performance against peers and progress against specific The grocery retail market remains highly strategic goals, awards were made at 80 per cent of the maximum available competitive and so it is as important as compared to 52 per cent last year.

Outcomes for performance-related pay reflect the achievement of stretching targets which were set in the context of the environment in which we are operating.
Overall variable pay has increased as a result of a payout under the annual bonus unlike last year and a higher level of Deferred Share Award.
However, Future Builder our long-term incentive plan did not vest for a second consecutive year, which reflects the shift in market conditions since this award was originally granted.

I hope this section provides This measure will help drive our strategic objective of being there for our shareholders with a useful overview of the key features of our customers.
The Annual Report on Remuneration, on pages 70 to 77, discusses all Future Builder payments and decisions made in relation to the 2015 16 financial year.
Prior to the grant of Future Builder awards, the Committee rigorously reviews For ease of reference, at the back of this report the policy tables which the performance criteria to ensure the measures and targets are aligned to formed part of the Directors Remuneration Policy approved by our corporate strategy and appropriately motivate participants to deliver shareholders at the 2014 AGM have been included.
The full policy can be performance above and beyond the expected level.
Ordinarily these targets found in our 2014 Annual Report on our website at: http: would be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report prior to the grant of www.
The Remuneration Committee remains firmly committed to the principle of In light of the proposed acquisition of Home Retail Group plc, the Committee pay for performance, ensuring that rewards of the senior leadership team are has decided that, on a one-off basis, the setting of the performance criteria aligned with the experience of long-term shareholders, while staying true to for the 2016 awards should be deferred until the outcome of the acquisition our Company values.
The Committee believes it is important to ensure that the performance conditions and targets are aligned to the Companys strategic objectives over the next three years.
If the acquisition successfully completes, the targets need to be meaningful in the context of the enlarged group and the strategy communicated to shareholders.
The targets for any awards would be expected to be of comparable stretch to those granted in prior years.
Following determination of the performance criteria later in the year, the Committee will communicate details of the measures and targets to shareholders.
