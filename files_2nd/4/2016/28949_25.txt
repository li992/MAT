2 Buyout award of 190,000 was made to the Group Chief Financial Officer on recruitment in the form of Saga shares 101,932 based on Sagas closing share price on 7 April 2015 of 186.4p.
The award will vest in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversary of the Group Chief Financial Officers commencement of employment with Saga.
In determining this amount the Committee applied the buyout element contained in the recruitment policy.
The buyout of the outstanding Bovis awards held by the Group Chief Financial Officer were valued based on the publicly available information disclosed and took into account the vesting periods and probability of the performance conditions being satisfied at the date of cessation.
This fair value was then discounted further to take into account the decreased probability of some of the longer term elements actually vesting.
The discounted fair value was then converted in to a value of Saga shares which vest subject to continued employment.
There are no further performance conditions attached to the vesting of these shares as the original performance conditions were taken into account in determining the buy-out value and therefore the imposition of additional performance conditions would in fact amount to a second set of performance conditions on vesting.
3 The former Executive Chairman and Group Chief Financial Officer were provided a one-off award on IPO IPO Award.
The shares under the IPO Awards were fully vested on IPO with the sale restrictions on the shares lifted on 29 May 2015 in accordance with the lock up arrangements outlined in the IPO prospectus.
The Group Chief Executive Officer was provided a share and cash award on IPO.
Share award consisted of a one-off award on IPO of market value share options with an exercise price equal to Sagas share price on Admission of1.85 with a face value of 4m.

Cash award of 4m based on continued employment.
25% immediately on the IPO, 25% on the first anniversary of the award and 50% will be paid on the second anniversary: this was part of the buyout on the recruitment of the Group Chief Executive Officer to compensate for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 JANUARY 2016 SAGA PLC 97 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Comparison of overall performance and pay The graph below shows the value of 100 invested in the Companys shares since listing compared with the FTSE 250 index.
The graph shows the TSR generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of dividend income.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this since listing.
This graph has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations.
It should be noted that the Company listed on 23 May 2014 and therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 23 May 2014 to 31 January 2016.
The Group Chief Executive Officer joined the Company on 24March 2014 therefore the remuneration shown is not for the full financial year.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration payable in its earlier years as a private company to the Executive Chairman does not bear comparative value to that which has been and will be paid to the Group Chief Executive Officer.
Therefore the Remuneration Committee has chosen to disclose remuneration for the Group Chief Executive Officer only for the two most recent financial years: Group Chief Executive 2015 16 2014 15 Total single figure 1,600,287 5,328,702 Annual bonus payment level achieved percentage of maximum opportunity 78.6% 80.7% LTIP vesting level achieved percentage of maximum opportunity n a n a Option vesting level achieved percentage of maximum opportunity n a n a There was no long-term incentive plan or share option plan operated prior to listing.
It should be noted that 4m of the single total figure for 2014 15 related to the award granted on Admission, which was a one-off payment to compensate for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer.

Change in the Group Chief Executive Officers remuneration compared with employees The following table sets out the change in the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive Officer from 2014 15 to 2015 16 compared to the average percentage change for employees.
The Group Chief Executive Officers remuneration disclosed in the table below has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits, excluding his pension, and annual bonus including any amount deferred.
The employee pay has been calculated using the following elements: annual salary base salary and standard monthly allowances: taxable benefits car allowance and private medical insurance premiums: annual bonus Company bonus, management bonus, commission and incentive payments.
It should be noted that the remuneration for 2014 15 has been annualised to allow a direct comparison with 2015 16 as the Group Chief Executive Officer was not appointed until 24 March 2014.
The change in his taxable benefits is as a result of choosing to receive a Company car under the Car Policy instead of a cash based car allowance.
His salary, taxable benefits, and bonus for 2014 15 have been included on an annualised basis to aid comparison.
2 The Group Chief Executive Officers bonus for both years includes cash awards of 1,000,000 as part of his recruitment as compensation for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer.
3 All values for 2014 15 have been adjusted to exclude the Group Chief Executive Officer who was previously included as part of this population.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 JANUARY 2016 SAGA PLC 99 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Statement of conditions elsewhere in the Company Each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Team, the Remuneration Committee considers a report prepared by the Group HR Director detailing remuneration practice across the Company.
The report provides an overview of how employee pay compares to the market and any material changes during the year, and includes detailed analysis of basic pay and variable pay changes within the UK.
While the Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating the Remuneration Policy, the Company does receive an update and feedback from the broader employee population on an annual basis using an engagement survey which includes a number of questions relating to remuneration.
The Company does not use remuneration comparison measurements.
The Group aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core structure as for the Executive Directors.
The Group operates employee share and variable pay plans, with pension provisions provided for all Executive Directors and employees.
In addition, any salary increases for Executive Directors are expected to be generally in line with those for UK based employees.
