In January 2017 David Ritchie stepped down from his role as Chief Executive.
Remuneration arrangements in respect of his departure have been determined by the Committee in line with his service contract and the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2014.
Full details can be found on page 78.
Alastair Lyons Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Bovis Homes Group PLC | 59 Policy report The remuneration policy The Companys existing Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the Companys 2014 Annual General Meeting and took effect from the date of that meeting.
The new policy set out below will be proposed for adoption at the AGM on 2 May 2017.
If approved it will apply on a legislative basis immediately following shareholder approval and will replace the policy approved in 2014.
No significant changes have been made to the policy that was approved in 2014.
However, certain amendments have been made to take account of corporate developments since then and to ensure the policy remains appropriate for the Company going forwards.
The changes made to the proposed policy as compared to the policy approved in 2014 can be summarised as follows: Variable pay performance metrics The 2017 remuneration policy will include greater flexibility in terms of the balance between financial and non-financial performance measures for awards made under the variable pay plans.
This allows the Committee to introduce key operational performance metrics, in addition to financial metrics, if such focus is considered appropriate in any given year.
The Committee intends to make use of this flexibility for 2017, as set out in the implementation section on pages 76 to 78.
Holding period for LTIP awards Awards granted from 2017 onwards will be subject to a two year post-vesting holding period, to further strengthen long term alignment with shareholders.
Increased shareholding guideline for CEO position The shareholding guideline for the CEO position will be increased from 100% to 200% of base salary to bring it into line with investor guidelines.
The shareholding guidelines are now included in the formal remuneration policy.
Malus and clawback provisions Malus and clawback provisions were not included in the 2014 remuneration policy but were introduced for variable pay from 2016 onwards.
Malus and clawback provisions will, therefore, be formalised in the 2017 remuneration policy.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback can be applied have also been extended to bring them into line with market practice.
Summary The remuneration policy is designed to provide a market competitive, performance-related package which supports and facilitates the delivery of the Companys strategy, the long-term success of the Company, and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
The Committee intends to apply the 2017 remuneration policy for three years and will keep the policy under review to ensure it promotes the attraction, retention and motivation of the high performing executive talent required to deliver the business strategy.
Should any changes be required before the end of the three year period, the amended policy will be put to shareholders, following shareholder consultation, as appropriate.

Notes to the policy table The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.
The executive directors may request and the Company may grant salary and bonus sacrifice arrangements.
The LTIP rules permit the substitution or variance of performance conditions to produce a fairer measure of performance as a result of an unforeseen event or transaction and include discretions for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
Non-significant changes to the performance metrics may be made by use of discretion under the LTIP rules.
Awards are normally satisfied in shares, although there is flexibility to settle in cash.
The Committee reserves the right to make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments that are not in line with the policy table set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed: i before 16 May 2014 the date the Companys existing remuneration policy came into effect : ii before the policy set out in this 2016 Annual Report came into effect, provided that the terms of payment were consistent with the shareholder approved directors remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed: or iii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and an award over shares is agreed at the time the award is granted.
Performance measures for the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP are selected to focus the executive directors on strategic financial and operational priorities, both short term and those related to long term sustainable performance, providing alignment with shareholder interests.
Targets for each performance measure are then set by the Committee in light of strategic objectives over the short term for the annual bonus scheme and over at least a three year performance period for the LTIP.
In setting targets the Committee takes into account a number of reference points including internal and analysts forecasts.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 63 Policy report The remuneration policy Illustration of the application of the remuneration policy Our aim is to ensure that superior reward is only paid for exceptional performance, with a substantial proportion of executive directors reward opportunity being performance related.
The chart below sets out remuneration scenarios for the executive director at three levels of performance, as a percentage of the total reward opportunity and as a total value.

The Remuneration Committee, with the Chairman absenting himself from discussions, sets the remuneration of the Chairman who receives an all-inclusive fee.
The level of fees must be within the limit approved by shareholders, contained in the Articles of Association.
Non-executive directors and the Chairman do not participate in the annual bonus scheme or the LTIP and are not eligible to join the Groups pension schemes.
All non-executive director and chairman fees are payable in cash and there are no additional fees or other items in the nature of remuneration.
All non-executive directors and the Chairman may receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred and the Company may satisfy any related tax liabilities.

fees may be paid for additional responsibilities such as chairmanship membership of a committee.
Fees are set at a level considered appropriate taking account of competitive positioning, the individuals responsibilities, the time commitment required and the size and complexity of the Company.
Approach to recruitment In agreeing a remuneration package for a new executive director, it would be expected that the structure and quantum of variable pay elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above.
However, the Committee would retain the discretion to flex the balance between annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to assess performance for these elements, with the intention that a significant proportion would be delivered in shares.
Salary would reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and may be set at a level to allow future progression to reflect performance in the role.
On recruitment, relocation benefits may be paid as appropriate.
This overall approach would also apply to internal appointments, with the proviso that any commitments entered into before promotion which are inconsistent with this policy can continue to be honoured under the policy.
Similarly, if an executive director is appointed following the Companys acquisition of or merger with another company, legacy terms and conditions would be honoured.
An executive director may initially be hired on a contract requiring 24 months notice which then reduces pro-rata over the first year of the contract to requiring 12 months notice.
The Committee may award compensation for the forfeiture of awards from a previous employer in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking account of all relevant factors including the expected value of the award, performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award.
There is no specific limit on the value of such awards, but the Committees intention is that the value awarded would be equivalent to the value forfeited.
Maximum variable pay will be in line with the maximum set out in the policy table above excluding buy-outs.
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual circumstances when: An interim appointment is made to a fill an executive director role on a short-term basis.
Exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
For non-executive directors, the Board would consider the appropriate fees for a new appointment taking into account the existing level of fees paid to the non-executive directors, the experience and ability of the new non-executive director and the time commitment and responsibility of the role.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 65 Policy report The remuneration policy Service contracts and exit payments policy The current executive directors service contract contains the key elements shown below.
Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by either employer or director Termination payment Up to 12 months salary excluding bonus or other enhancement The executive directors service contract does not contain specific provision for compensation in the event of early termination, with the exception of 12 months base salary in the event of removal at an AGM.
When determining exit payments, the Committee would take account of a variety of factors, including individual and business performance, the obligation for the director to mitigate loss for example, by gaining new employment, the directors length of service and any other relevant circumstances, such as ill health.
A departing director may also be entitled to a payment in respect of statutory rights.
Should a departing director be required to retire and be eligible for an early retirement pension under the terms of the defined benefit pension arrangement, an actuarial reduction will only be applied, in accordance with the rules, if the departing director has not reached age 55.
The Committee would distinguish between types of leaver in respect of incentive plans.
Good leavers death, ill-health, agreed retirement, redundancy or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee may be considered for a bonus payment having completed the full year and part year bonus payments may be paid and LTIP awards may vest at the usual time taking into account performance conditions and pro rating for time in employment during the performance period, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
The LTIP rules include discretion for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised for good leavers and, in exceptional circumstances, acceleration of the realisation date.
In all other leaver circumstances, the Committee would decide the approach taken, which would ordinarily mean that leavers would not be entitled to consideration for a bonus and LTIP awards would lapse.
Any vested LTIP award that is subject to a holding period at the time of the executives cessation of employment will not lapse except in the case of the executives gross misconduct.
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a directors cessation of office or employment where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of a directors office or employment.
In addition, the Committee reserves the right, acting in good faith, to pay fees for outplacement assistance and or the directors legal and or professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of office or employment.
The appointment of the Chairman and each of the non-executive directors is for an initial period of three years, which is renewable for further terms, and is terminable by the Chairman non-executive director as applicable or the Company on twelve months notice.
Any new Chairman non-executive director appointments will be subject to a three month notice period.
No contractual payments would be due on termination.
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination for the nonexecutive directors, with the exception of entitlement to compensation equivalent to 12 months fees or, if less, the balance of appointment, in the event of removal at an AGM.
Change of control All the Companys share plans contain provisions relating to change of control.
In general, outstanding awards would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied at that time, reflecting the time period to the date of the event.
Any deferred bonus shares will be released on change of control.
The LTIP rules include discretion for upwards adjustment to the number of shares to be realised in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or voluntary winding up.
External directorships Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside the Group and retain any associated fees.
66 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance Our governance Policy report Pay and conditions throughout the Group The pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group are considered by the Committee in setting remuneration policy for the executive directors and senior management.
The Committee is kept regularly informed on the pay and benefits provided to employees and base salary increase data from the annual salary review for general staff is considered when reviewing executive directors salaries and those of senior management.
The Committee does not consult with employees when setting remuneration policy for the executive directors.
Difference in the Companys policy on remuneration of directors compared to employees The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed with pay and conditions throughout the Group in mind.
The Committee believes that some differences are necessary to reflect responsibility and provide appropriate focus and motivation for delivery of the Groups strategy.
Executive directors, therefore, have a higher bonus opportunity than employees generally to motivate them to achieve stretching annual targets and they participate in the LTIP to provide focus on long term sustainable performance.
This approach is designed to provide an appropriate emphasis on performance related pay.
Consideration of shareholder views The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on directors remuneration.
Feedback received from meetings during the year and in relation to the AGM is considered, together with guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally, and taken into account in the annual review of remuneration policy.
The Committee believes that it has a responsible approach to directors pay and that its policy is appropriate and fit for purpose.
Support from shareholders is evidenced by the 99.19% approval of the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report at the 2016 AGM see the annual remuneration report for further details.
Major shareholders were consulted on the changes to the remuneration policy, including the increased flexibility in variable pay plan performance metrics, the adoption of post vesting holding periods for LTIP awards, and the increase in the shareholding guideline for the CEO to 200% and their feedback was incorporated into the final proposals.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 67 Annual remuneration report Remuneration report Introduction This annual remuneration report explains how the remuneration policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 December 2016 and how it will be implemented for 2017.

68 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance Our governance Annual remuneration report The link between remuneration and strategy As set out in the Strategic Report, the Group has a strategic plan containing both near and longer term objectives.
These objectives include the delivery of improving levels of return and operating profit, increasing the efficiency of capital employed, building quality homes on time and delivering high levels of customer satisfaction.
These objectives are measured by reference to the Groups reported KPIs of pre-tax profit, ROCE, earnings per share, the build programme agreed as part of the annual business plan, and customer satisfaction scores, all of which are now built into the Groups incentive schemes.
Annual bonus arrangements are clearly linked to the Groups near term strategy via the inclusion of profit before tax, ROCE and customer satisfaction performance measures.
For 2017, we have added quantifiable build programme delivery as a new performance measure in response to the need for the Group to prioritise the improvement of its build operating practices.
The LTIP has a longer term perspective and for 2016 awards feature performance measures of relative total shareholder return and earnings per share, both of which are measured over a three year period and ROCE, measured in year three of the performance period.
The Committee will conclude on the performance measures, weightings and targets for the 2017 awards following the annual Strategic Planning Review and intends to grant awards in August 2017.
In line with the proposed policy, at least two thirds of the award will be based on financial and or share price based metrics and quantifiable non-financial metrics, key to business performance, will be used for any balance.
Disclosure of the detailed measures, weightings and targets will be made in the 2017 Remuneration Report.
The Committee has reviewed the remuneration policy for submission to the 2017 AGM and is satisfied that the proposed remuneration arrangements will closely align with the Groups business strategy and appropriately reflect the need to improve operational performance.
Key remuneration decisions during 2016 During 2016, the Committee set targets for the 2016 annual bonus shown on page 71 and approved 2015 bonus payments.
It set targets for and approved LTIP awards made in 2016 and approved the level of vesting for the 2013 LTIP awards.
It also introduced malus and clawback provisions to incentive awards from 2016 onwards.
A consultation with shareholders took place on proposed changes to the remuneration policy to be submitted to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
The Committee also completed the 2017 remuneration review, which included consideration of the link between executive remuneration and pay and employment conditions throughout the Group including the general proposals for staff for 2017.

The Committee therefore, awarded 10% against the maximum 20% weighting for this performance measure.
Earl Sibley was set the following personal objectives for 2016, designed to enhance the effectiveness of those areas under his responsibility and to improve the Groups capital and cost effectiveness: To develop and implement the years investor relations plan To reduce capital employed by reducing the Groups net current assets To improve cost effectiveness through better procurement and control of costs and improved cost reporting To implement a balanced scorecard approach to business reporting To improve the effectiveness of Internal Audit, thereby strengthening the Groups framework of internal control The Committee considered that Earl had made good progress against his range of objectives, putting the Group in a better position now to tackle the challenges that were manifest in 2016.
In particular, the Groups internal business reporting was much improved, providing the transparency required for effective management: Internal Audit had been redesigned to provide much improved oversight of the framework of internal control: and regional plans were well developed to improve capital efficiency.
Improving cost effectiveness remains an area of material focus.
The Committee awarded two thirds or 13.3% against the maximum 20% weighting of this performance measure.
Given the difficult year experienced by the Group and its failure to achieve its financial and customer satisfaction targets the Committee has decided that it would be inappropriate to pay these bonuses in cash.
Instead, it will subject to any regulatory restrictions apply its discretion to pay Earls bonus in shares which will be subject to a two year holding period.
David Ritchie has agreed, as a modification of his entitlements on ceasing to be employed by the Group, as set out later in this report, that his bonus be delivered in the same way.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will ordinarily vest after three years.
Discretions available to the Committee contained in the LTIP rules are set out in the policy table and also in the exit payments policy on pages 62 and 66.
Awards vesting in respect of 2016 The LTIP awards made in 2014 were measured over the three year period to 31 December 2016 and will vest to the extent of 35.9% on 25 February and 19 August 2017.
One third of the award was measured against each of EPS performance, TSR performance against an index and ROCE performance.
The threshold EPS target was 230p and the maximum target was 280p measured on a cumulative three year basis.
Absolute cumulative EPS over the three year performance period was 264.1p.
Therefore, 77.7% of the EPS element will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the annualised median of the index and the maximum target was performance equal to the annualised median of the index, plus 10%.
Actual TSR was 18% which was below the median of the index of 59% and, therefore, none of the award based on TSR will vest.
72 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance Our governance Annual remuneration report The threshold ROCE target was 17% and the maximum target was 20% measured in the third year of the performance period 2016.
Actual ROCE in 2016 was 17% and, therefore, 30% of the ROCE element will vest.
Awards granted during 2016 audited An award of 93,696 shares was made to David Ritchie at 150% of basic salary at a grant price of 8.805 on 23 February 2016, exercisable in 2019 and subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2018, as follows: Number of shares Face value at date % of face value that Executive director Type of award awarded of grant 000 would vest at threshold David Ritchie Performance share award 93,696 825 30 An award of 39,040 shares was made to Earl Sibley at 125% of basic salary at a grant price of 8.805 on 23 February 2016, exercisable in 2019 and subject to a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2018, as follows: Number of shares Face value at date % of face value that Executive director Type of award awarded of grant 000 would vest at threshold Earl Sibley Performance share award 39,040 344 30 The performance measures for all 2016 awards are unchanged from the prior year, namely TSR 33.3%, EPS 33.3% and ROCE 33.3%.

Pensions During 2016, David Ritchie was a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme BHPS.
This is a contributory funded, defined benefit scheme, approved by HMRC.
He received a pension allowance of 20% of salary and some or all of this allowance was used in relation to his membership of the BHPS, to the extent that it remained beneficial in light of new pension legislation.
The balance was paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable salary supplement.
Earl Sibley is a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan GPP and the Companys contribution is 15% of his base salary.
There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions for executive directors, except as noted in the exit payments policy.
Any new appointments would include eligibility for membership of the GPP, unless the appointee was already a member of the BHPS.

Implementation of remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2017 Changes in the way that remuneration policy will be implemented in 2017 versus 2016 include base salary increases, the addition of a quantifiable build programme delivery measure for the 2017 annual bonus and a rebalancing of the weightings for the other performance measures, and the strengthening of provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback in incentive schemes.
A two year holding period before vested awards can be exercised is also being introduced for the LTIP awards made from 2017 onwards.
The Committee will conclude on the most appropriate performance measures, targets and weightings for these awards, following the annual Strategic Planning Review, with the intention that awards will be granted in August 2017.
Full details will be disclosed in the 2017 annual remuneration report.
Executive directors base salaries and benefits The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2017 were as follows: % increase Executive directors Position 2017 base salary from 2016 David Ritchie resigned 9 01 17 CEO 563,750 2.5% Earl Sibley appointed 16 04 15 GFD 300,000 9.1% The salary of David Ritchie, the former Chief Executive, was increased by 2.5%, in line with the wider employee population.
76 | Annual report and accounts | Our governance 6% 4% 10% 7% 18% 13% Our governance m Annual remuneration report The Committee carefully considered the increase for Earl Sibley, in line with the phased approach set out in the 2015 Remuneration Report, and on which shareholders were previously consulted.
In summary, Earl Sibley was appointed in April 2015 on a salary of 250,000 with the expectation that salary would be increased to an appropriate market rate for a strongly performing experienced individual over the first three years of service, subject to individual performance and increased experience.
In view of the ongoing strong performance being delivered by Earl Sibley, his pace of development, increased level of experience and his contribution to the Group, the Committee decided to progress his salary by 9.1% for 2017, following the increase of 10% for 2016.
The Committee considers that this progressive approach contributes to his being fully motivated to meet the challenges ahead in delivering operational improvement and the Groups strategy to the benefit of shareholders.
Earl Sibley was appointed as Interim Chief Executive from 9 January 2017 and will receive a temporary salary uplift of 450,000 per annum whilst in this role.
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for general staff increases.
Benefits will continue on the same basis as for 2016.
Approach to annual bonus Following the regular annual review, it was concluded that the annual bonus scheme for 2017 should be adjusted to measure key elements of performance that are in line with the Companys particular circumstances and the need to focus on strong operational delivery and high levels of customer satisfaction.
The Committee has, therefore, adjusted the balance of financial and non-financial metrics from 70%:30% to 50%:50% and has introduced a quantifiable build programme delivery measure.
The weightings for the remaining performance measures have been rebalanced.
Full details are given below.
There is no change to quantum.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback have been strengthened and can apply to the annual bonus in circumstances of i a serious misstatement of results: ii an error in assessing a performance condition or in the information on which the award was granted: iii serious misconduct: iv a material failure of risk management: v serious reputational damage: or vi any other circumstances that the Committee considers to be similar in nature or effect.
Malus can apply prior to the bonus payment date and clawback can apply for a two year period thereafter.
The Committee has decided not to disclose the detail of performance targets in advance as they are considered commercially sensitive, being closely indicative of the Groups strategy, but will disclose them retrospectively in the 2017 annual remuneration report.
The 2017 performance measures and weightings are described below.
Measure Rationale link to strategy % weighting Financial measures 50% Profit before tax Explicitly ties reward to financial performance.
20% Challenges management to deliver and out-perform profit target.
ROCE Aligns the way the business is managed with the key interest of 30% shareholders, being the return achieved on invested capital.
Non-financial measures 50% Build programme delivery Improving build operating practices and delivering quality homes 20% on time is key to operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, reputation and future success.
Measured by delivery against the build programme agreed as part of the annual business plan.
Customer satisfaction Quality of service is key to reputation and future success, both in 20% terms of customer demand and achieved selling prices.
Measured by the average score achieved in our internal customer satisfaction surveys.
Individual performance Focuses the executive directors on strategic priorities and the 10% achievement of defined elements within their roles.
Total opportunity 100% Bovis Homes Group PLC | 77 Annual remuneration report Remuneration report Approach for Long Term Incentive Plan awards The key features of the long term incentive arrangements as outlined on page 73 are expected to remain the same as those for 2016, with the proviso that the Committee intends to introduce the Home Builders Federation Customer Satisfaction rating as a performance measure, alongside the financial and share price performance measures.
The financial measures will comprise at least two thirds of awards and the HBF Customer Satisfaction rating, which is independently and objectively assessed, will make up the balance.
The Committee will conclude on the specific performance measures, weightings and targets for the 2017 awards following the annual Strategic Planning Review.
It is intending to delay the grant of awards until August 2017 and detailed disclosure will be provided in the 2017 Remuneration Report.
Provisions that enable the withholding of payment or the recovery of sums paid malus and clawback can apply in certain circumstances as set out in the policy report.
Malus can apply prior to the award vesting date and clawback can apply for a two year period thereafter.
A two year holding period following vesting has been introduced for the 2017 awards onwards, which extends to five years the time between awards being granted and when they can be exercised.
Pensions Pension arrangements as outlined on page 73 will continue on the same basis as in 2016.
