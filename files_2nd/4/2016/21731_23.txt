Chairs letter As Chair of the Remuneration Committee the Committee and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present our Board report on remuneration for the 2016 financial year, in line with the requirements of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
This report comprises two sections.
The first part Section A describes how the existing policy, approved at the 2016 AGM, was implemented in 2016.
The second part Section B summarises the policy of the Board with regard to the remuneration of the directors.
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2016, is available on our website.
I would like to thank our shareholders for their support in approving the Remuneration Policy at the AGM in 2016.
Our approach is based on simple, competitive reward that closely aligns the pay of our senior executives with our Companys strategy.
It is designed to incentivise and motivate the behaviours and actions that will deliver strong returns to shareholders.
The new Remuneration Policy was developed to help better achieve these goals, creating a simpler framework aligned with best practice, new corporate governance requirements, and to reflect the changing nature of our business in the coming years.
I would also like to welcome Patrick Larmon, who was appointed on 13 September 2016, to the Board and Committee.
Context and key Committee decisions on remuneration 2016 has seen the business respond to challenging market conditions linked to a subdued demand for industrial machinery and a reduction in oil & gas activity.
However, the business has a robust balance sheet with minimal leverage and cash generation has remained strong over the period.
This has allowed continued investment in areas where we believe there will be sustainable value creation for shareholders, particularly in Specialist Technologies and focusing on high added value services in Classical Heat Treatment.
In 2016, the weakness in trading experienced by the business has been largely offset by the positive currency translation impact resulting from exchange rate movements.
In the context of the above, the decisions made by the Committee in respect of the remuneration of the executives are set out below and reflect the achievement against the relevant performance conditions.
The Committee also considers the conditions and pay of the wider workforce when making decisions on remuneration of the executives.
All the decisions made by the Committee are in line with the approved Remuneration Policy.
The annual bonus paid out at 19% of maximum bonus for the Group Chief Executive, and at 14% of maximum bonus for the Group Finance Director, David Landless, due to partial achievement of cash flow targets and personal objectives.
The 2014 BIP Bodycote Incentive Plan did not vest as performance conditions were not met.
The 2013 CIP Co-Investment Plan vested at 93.3% of maximum due to achieving absolute TSR growth of 9.9% during the performance period.
The Committee also reviewed the base salary of the Group Chief Executive and determined that an inflationary salary increase of 3% will be made effective from 1 January 2017.
The 2016 average salary increase for the wider UK workforce was 2.1%.
As David Landless retired on 1 January 2017, he is not eligible for a salary review or increase.
The salary of Dominique Yates, who commenced on 1 November 2016, will be reviewed next in January 2018.

Dominique took up his new role as Chief Financial Officer on 2 January 2017, succeeding David Landless who announced his intention to retire from the Board on 25 February 2016 after serving 17 years with Bodycote.
Dominique Yates remuneration on appointment is in line with the approved Remuneration Policy and full details are set out in Section A of this report.
On his appointment, Dominiques base salary was set at 380,000 to reflect his experience and the skills he will bring to the role.
Under normal circumstances it would not be envisaged that Dominique will receive higher than normal salary increases in the coming years.
From 2017, Dominique is eligible to participate in Bodycotes annual bonus and Bodycote Incentive Plan and has not received any buyout or additional awards.
David Landless remuneration will be treated in line with the approved Remuneration Policy on his departure.
David will not receive any additional payments as a result of his departure.
Full details are set out in Section A of this remuneration report.
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Committee members, as well as all those who supported the Committee in the year, for their support throughout this review.
As a Committee we are fully committed to continue an open dialogue with our shareholders.
I would welcome your views on the content of this report or any other items you would like to discuss.

Base salary The base salaries of the executive directors are reviewed on an annual basis.

The plan is entirely cash-based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior executives.
Group contributions are discretionary, vary year on year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore are cost neutral to the Group.
Any risk in relation to the value of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants.
The plan was terminated in November 2016 and no further contributions will be made.
Annual performance related bonus 2016 Annual bonus The Committee has decided, in line with market practice, to disclose information in respect of last years annual bonus targets.
The table below provides the details of the annual bonus awards received in respect of the Group and individual performances in the 2016 financial year.
The annual bonus potential for the period to 31 December 2016 for executive directors was split 77% in respect of Group headline operating profit, 10% on Group headline operating cash flow and 13% on personal strategic objectives.
These performance conditions and their respective weightings reflected the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be linked both to the overall performance of the Group and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
Due to significant pressures, particularly in the oil & gas sector, the performance of the Group during the year included headline operating profit of 88.4m at constant exchange rates 13% decrease on prior year and headline operating cash flow of 79.3m at constant exchange rates 3% decrease on prior year.
No bonus is payable on headline operating profit since the threshold was not met.
The Committee also assessed the performance of the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, David Landless, against their personal objectives, which included targets relating to safety, focus on driving growth, implementation of sales strategy, succession planning, as well as implementation of major projects.
The Committee concluded that personal strategic objectives were achieved at a level of 80% of the maximum award for the Group Chief Executive.
The Group Finance Director, David Landless, achieved 40% of maximum.

Bodycote Incentive Plan Awards with performance periods ending in the year BIP awards made in 2014 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2016, with 50% of the award subject to satisfaction of a ROCE target and 50% subject to the headline earnings per share EPS target.

Over the period, ROCE was 17.1% and the headline EPS figure for the year was 37.0p.
As the targets were not achieved, the Committee concluded that the 2014 share award will not vest.
Awards made in the year BIP awards with a face value of 175% of salary were granted to both executive directors in June 2016 and will vest in March 2019, subject to the achievement of ROCE and headline EPS growth performance targets.
The performance period will end on 31 December 2018.
The vesting of these awards will be based on ROCE and headline EPS targets summarised in the table below.
The Committee has reviewed the performance targets and these have been altered accordingly to ensure that they remain stretching targets which underpin the Groups objectives.

The Committee has decided that the ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and is cognisant of the fact that over-incentivising on capital employed can lead to unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital underinvestment for the business.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of those shares that vest.
The number and value of shares that were awarded to the executive directors during the year is set out on page 58.
Co-Investment Plan CIP Awards with performance periods ending in the year As described in Section B: Directors Remuneration Policy, CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target.

The absolute TSR performance targets applicable to this award are set out below.
Absolute TSR performance target Vesting level 4% CAGR CPI 50% 0.5:1 match 10% CAGR CPI 100% 1:1 match Over the three-year period, the Group achieved absolute TSR growth of 9.9%.
This performance resulted in the TSR targets being achieved at a level of 93.3%.
The number and value of shares which vested to each of the executive directors is set out on page 58.
No awards were made in the year.
Implementation of policy in 2017 Base salary is reviewed on an annual basis.
The 2017 base salary increases from 1 January 2017 were 3% for the Group Chief Executive and 0% for the Chief Financial Officer, having recently been appointed.
As 2016 base salary increases for the Group are applied after the publication of this report, the comparative figure for 2017 can only be provided in next years report.
The comparative figure for 2016 is disclosed in the base salary section on page 56.
The new Chief Financial Officer, Dominique Yates, replaced David Landless as of 2 January 2017.
His salary on appointment was 380,000.
This reflects his significant and valuable experience in international multi-site businesses, and the need to ensure his reward package was appropriate in the context of that in his previous role to facilitate his recruitment.
Dominiques company pension contribution is 25% of salary.
As of 2017, Dominique was invited to participate in the annual bonus plan at 150% of base salary with deferral of bonus in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Dominique will also be invited to participate in the Bodycote Incentive Plan at 175% of salary as of 2017.
Benefits provided include the provision of company car or allowance, private medical insurance, shortand long-term sick pay and death in service cover.
Taxable work-related expenses such as travel and relocation are also provided.
David Landless resigned as an executive director as of 1 January 2017.
The Remuneration Committee has decided that as a good leaver, Davids 2014 and 2015 Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP and Co-Investment Plan CIP awards will be pro-rated to his leaving date and are subject to achievement of performance conditions at the end of the three-year performance period.
No CIP awards were made in 2016.
For 2017, the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors and senior executives will again be contingent on meeting targets relating to operating profit, cash management and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant for the Groups business strategy.
In line with prior years, the 2017 annual bonus targets will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report.
The Committee has determined to set the targets for the 2017 BIP awards as disclosed below.
The targets below were set in the context of significant pressures in the sector and to ensure that the Committee is able to deliver upper quartile reward for upper quartile performance.

The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate, clearly supports the Companys strategic ambitions and does not incentivise inappropriate risk taking.
This is reviewed on an annual basis.
The composition and value of each executive directors remuneration package, should they achieve below, at or above target performance, are set out in the charts below.
For Dominique Yates, the first BIP grant will be in 2017 and therefore no vesting will occur until early 2020.
For the purposes of this analysis, the following methodology has been used: Fixed elements comprise base salary and other benefits: Base salary reflects the base salary as at 1 January 2017.
Benefits reflect benefits received in 2016.
For on-target performance, an assumption of 60% of annual bonus is applied and vesting of 50% of the maximum of the BIP.
No share price increase or dividend reinvestment has been assumed.
Fixed elements are salary, benefits and pension.
Annual variable element is the annual bonus including both cash and deferred shares.
Long-term variable element is the BIP award and dividend equivalents.

Number of shares held on date of retirement.
As described in Section B: Directors Remuneration Policy, the Board operates a shareholding retention policy under which executive directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company.
For the purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares will be counted.
At the December 2015 Remuneration Committee meeting it was decided to increase the minimum shareholding requirement to 200% of salary for the Chief Executive and to 150% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The new shareholding requirement will not need to be achieved until five years after the adoption of the new requirement.
As at 31 December 2016, the Committee is satisfied that executive directors have fulfilled this requirement.
At the 31 December 2016 share price, S. C. Harris held 224% of salary and D. Yates will only need to have achieved 150% within five years of his appointment but already holds 340% of salary.
D. F. Landless retired on 1 January 2017.

In order to ensure continued alignment between remuneration and the evolving strategic direction of our business, a revised policy was put to our shareholders at the AGM in May 2016 and approved.
This policy, applicable from the date of the 2016 AGM, is set out below.
Discretion The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant Plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Executive Remuneration Policy The table below sets out the key components of executive directors pay packages, including why they are used and how they are operated in practice.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out on pages 64 to 73 where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being agreed at the time the award is granted.
Executive directors remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors.
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the executive directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.

The Chairman and non-executive directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.
Appropriate benefits may be provided to non-executives and the Chairman from time to time.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the non-executive directors and Chairman and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.
Fees retained for external non-executive directorships To broaden the experience of executive directors, they may hold positions in other companies as non-executive directors provided that permission is sought in advance.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any more than is necessary.
Senior and high-performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the executive directors to ensure reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating executive director pay policy.
However, it does take into account information provided by the Human Resources function and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating executive director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group.
The Committee does not use any remuneration comparison metrics.
com 25229.04 9 March 2017 5:13 PM PROOF 5 post self editing Additional information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Board report on remuneration continued Statement of consideration of shareholders views The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers.
The Committee documents all remuneration-related comments made at the Companys AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year.
Any feedback received is fully considered by the Committee.
In developing the proposed Remuneration Policy for 2016 and beyond the Remuneration Committee engaged extensively with the Companys key shareholders and their representative bodies.
Through this process the Remuneration Committee took on board the feedback received and refined the proposed Remuneration Policy as appropriate to ensure it meets the expectations of our shareholders.
Approach to recruitment remuneration When recruiting new executive directors, the Companys policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior executives, and that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity.
New executive directors will generally be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table below.
Each element of remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this context.
Component Policy General The Companys policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and experience appropriate to the role to be filled.
The initial notice period may be longer than the Companys one year policy up to a maximum of two years.
However, this will reduce by one month for every month served, until the Companys policy position is reached.
Base salary Base salary levels will be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate in consideration of the new recruits existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution to the new role, the current salaries of other executive directors in the Company and current market levels for the role.
Other benefits Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other executive director s. If it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, potentially including relocation costs, tax equalisation or advisers fees.
Pension Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other executive director s with a contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruits package as a whole, market practice at the time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for other executives.
Annual bonus Normal awards will be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The executive director may be invited to participate in the bonus on a pro rated basis in the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives Normal awards will be made under the BIP in line with the Remuneration Policy.
The executive director may be invited to participate in in flight BIP awards on a pro rated basis when appointed.
The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director in respect of his her recruitment.
In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 450% of base salary.
This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards.
This level of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets would need to be met.
For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any buyout payments or awards associated with forfeited awards.
Replacement awards For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and or share-based payments on recruitment, the Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders.
Such payments may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buyout awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous employer.
Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated value of them.
In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash or share-based, performance-related or not, the Companys recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider appropriate.
If a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the previous awards as accurately as possible.
We will make the award subject to appropriate malus and clawback provisions in the event that the individual resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe.
An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout award has been granted.
Internal promotions For internal promotions any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the new remuneration arrangements.
70 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2016 25229.04 9 March 2017 5:13 PM PROOF 5 post self editing Shareholders will be informed of any director appointment and the individuals remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new non-executive directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set out on page 69.

The non-executive directors are appointed by letters of appointment.
Each independent non-executive directors term of office runs for a maximum three year period.
The initial terms of the non-executive directors positions are subject to their re-election by the Companys shareholders at the next AGM and to re-election at any subsequent AGM at which the non-executive directors stand for re-election.
All directors will be put forward for re-election by shareholders on an annual basis.
Termination remuneration policy It is the Companys policy that executive directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one years notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one years basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer.
All future appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
The Committee will honour executive directors contractual entitlements.
Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses.
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case.
There are no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
There is no agreement between the Company and its executive directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid other than a legacy arrangement for D. F. Landless.

Treatment of cash If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other circumstances element of the bonus the Committee determines a good leaver, the level of bonus will be measured at the bonus measurement under Plan rules date.
Bonus will normally be pro-rated for the period worked during the financial year.
The Committee retains the discretion: to determine that an executive is a good leaver.
It is the Committees intention to only use this discretion in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders: not to pro-rate the bonus to time.
The Committees policy is that it will pro-rate bonus for time.
It is the Committees intention to use its discretion to not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Under all other circumstances no bonus will be earned on cessation of employment other than set out above in the legacy arrangements for current executive directors.
Treatment of unvested If termination is by way of death, injury, illness, disability, redundancy, retirement or any other circumstances deferred bonus awards the Committee determines a good leaver, deferred shares may be released to the participant at the normal under Plan rules vesting date.
Under all other circumstances unvested awards will lapse on cessation of employment.
The Committee has the following elements of discretion: to determine that an executive is a good leaver.
It is the Committees intention to only use this discretion in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders: to vest deferred shares at the end of the original deferral period or at the date of cessation.
The Committees policy is that shares will vest on the original date of vesting.
The Committee will make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation.
Treatment of unvested On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee determines BIP 2016, BIP 2006 and that the individual is a good leaver see above for definition.
In instances where the Committee determines that CIP awards awards should not lapse in full, awards will normally vest at the normal vesting date, pro-rated for time served and subject to the achievement of the original performance conditions.
It is the Committees intention to only use this discretion in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders: to measure performance over the original performance period or at the date of cessation.
The Committee will make this determination depending on the type of good leaver reason resulting in the cessation: and to pro-rate the maximum number of shares to the time from the date of grant to the date of cessation.
The Committees policy is that it will pro-rate awards for time.
It is the Committees intention to use discretion to not pro-rate in circumstances where there is an appropriate business case which will be explained in full to shareholders.
Exercise of discretion In the event that an executive director leaves the Company, the Committees policy for exit payments is to consider the reasons for cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually required are warranted.
Further, in the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims.
This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK or in other jurisdictions.
The Committee may also include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
Change of control Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in executive directors service contracts.
S. C. Harris does not have a change of control clause.
D. F. Landless service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 and provides for one years remuneration if his employment had been terminated on a change of control.
This provision has been preserved.
To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of not having change of control clauses in service contracts.
In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any executive director, other than payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
On change of control the awards under the Companys incentive plans will generally vest subject to performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and in accordance with the rules of the relevant Plan.
