This payment is subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the Board, is of the opinion that Mr Klotzs contribution and time commitment has gone far beyond that expected at the time of his appointment to Executive Chairman and his agreed fee level.
The one-off award level has been set such that it represents Mr Klotzs average historical award level under the PIP Element A which over its five year life has paid out on average 82.5% of maximum.
Hence, the award is commensurate with the bonus payments he has earned in recent years.
Included in the Taxable Benefits column is a long service gift to the value of 9,249.
