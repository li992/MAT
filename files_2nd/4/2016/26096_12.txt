The Chairman of the Committee reports to the Board on the Committees activities at the Board meeting immediately following each meeting.
Dear shareholder It is my pleasure to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2016 on behalf of the Board.
This remuneration report is split into two sections: The new Directors Remuneration Policy: and The Annual Report on Remuneration.
Policy Review Much of the Committees activity in 2016 has focused on reviewing our Remuneration Policy.
The revised Policy will be put to a binding vote at the Companys Annual General Meeting in May 2017.
Keller Group plc 59 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Directors remuneration report continued Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee continued Business context In 2015, our new CEO Alain Michaelis set out his vision for the group, to be the worlds leading geotechnical solutions provider, and since , .

It provides a stronger opportunity to build alignment between executive and shareholder interests, for example by encouraging and .
It requires reward in Keller to be competitive, to enable recruitment of new talent bringing in additional experience in driving change and .

In addition, we proposed that deferral of any bonus in excess of 100% of salary be into shares rather than cash.
This strengthens the alignment between Executives and our shareholders.
No changes were proposed to the maximum bonus opportunity.

60 Keller Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Finally, we developed a package of changes to the PSP designed to strengthen our position to attract and retain talent with the right experience including from other sectors: to shift the overall balance of our incentives towards the longer term: and to strengthen the alignment between executives and shareholders via increased shareholding.
The proposed changes were: An increase in the maximum operational award from 100% of salary for the Executive Directors.
Introduction of a two-year holding period in addition to the three-year vesting period.
An increase in the shareholding requirement for Executive Directors from 100% of base salary to 200% of base salary.
Based on the shareholder feedback we received see below, we have decided not to introduce this last package of changes at this time to the PSP in this policy revision.
Shareholder engagement In 2016, the Committee consulted extensively with our largest shareholders and their representative bodies on the development of our Remuneration Policy.
We were pleased by the level and quality of engagement and welcomed the constructive feedback provided through the .
 cumulative EPS targets for the PSP.
As we had anticipated, several shareholders emphasised the importance of targets being .
On the package of other proposed changes to the PSP policy increase in level of opportunity, introduction of a two-year holding period, increase in shareholding requirement, the majority of shareholders were again supportive.
They recognised the need for Keller reward to be competitive and the gap that has developed in the nine years since incentive levels were last increased, the .
Whilerecognisingthe validity of the proposed levels, they would prefer for any increases in opportunity to be delayed until our progress in implementing the new strategy is more established.
Keller Group plc 61 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Directors remuneration report continued Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee continued Our response and proposed way forward The Remuneration Committee has considered all of the feedback, and continues to believe that the full set of changes originally proposed will be needed in the future to underpin Kellers future success with a well-balanced and competitive reward structure aligned to the strategic direction.
However, we take the views and concerns of our shareholders very seriously and are mindful of the heightened political attention at the moment on executive pay.
We are therefore planning a measured, two-step approach: In our 2017 policy we are including the changes to the operation of the annual bonus described above.
We are also adjusting the PSP , , assupported in our consultation.
The other changes to PSP are seen as a package balancing executive and shareholder expectations.
We will revisit these over the course of the next year, with a likely further consultation and change in policy after one or two years when the timing is right in terms of progress in delivery of the strategic plan.
The Performance Share Plan did not vest in respect of the performance period ending in 2016.
The next Performance Share Plan due to vest will be based on performance ending in 2017.

However, where the Company is considering an internal promotion to the Board, the Remuneration Committee may, at its discretion, decide that any remuneration commitment agreed or entered into prior to the promotion will continue to be honoured even though that commitment may not be consistent with the prevailing policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Keller and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary for this purpose.
The table below summarises Committees approach on recruitment promotion: Component Approach Maximum Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current base salary.
Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, phased increases may be awarded over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role.
Pension New appointees may be eligible to receive pension contributions or an equivalent cash supplement in lieu of pension in line with the policy.

In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors such as expected values, any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met, time horizons, delivery mechanism and the terms of the forfeited remuneration.
To facilitate such compensation, the Committee may also rely on exemptions, procedures or provisions contained in the Listing Rules that permit awards to be granted in exceptional circumstances.
To ensure alignment from the outset with shareholders, malus and clawback provisions may also apply where appropriate and the Committee may require new Directors to acquire Company shares up to a pre-agreed level.
Shareholders will be informed of any buyout arrangements at the time of appointment.

The Committee retains discretion to settle any other amounts reasonably due to a departing Executive Director, for example legal fees incurred by an Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including but not limited to settlement or consultancy arrangements.
These will be used sparingly and only entered into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.
External appointments The Board may allow Executive Directors to accept external appointments and retain the fees: however, in accordance with the Code, the Board will not agree to a full-time executive taking on more than one Non-executive Directorship, or the chairmanship of any company.
