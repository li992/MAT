fdfdfds DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Annual statement Dear shareholder This report complies with the changes to the Companies Act which came into force on 1 October 2013.
Ben Whitley was appointed as finance director during the year, with a basic salary of 150,000.
The committee made the decision to increase the salaries of the CEO and the personnel and legal director by 9%, in recognition of their performance.
This compares with a 6.8% increase in average employees pay across the Company.
Executive directors will receive an award of 10.42% of basic salary, under the annual cash bonus plan, comprising 5% of basic salary under the quality-and standards element and 5.42% under the profit element.
Executive directors will also receive an amount equivalent of 25% of their salary in shares under a share incentive plan SIP.
The committee is proposing a change to the owners earnings calculation in the deferred bonus scheme, subject to shareholders approval at the 2016 AGM.
Subject to approval, executive directors will receive 52.2% of their salary in shares under the  element of the scheme and 7% under the EPS element.
In 2015, long-service awards were introduced across the Company for all employees with over 25 years service.
Because the prevailing remuneration policy for executive directors did not include this element, the remuneration committee has been unable to make payments under this scheme to John Hutson and Su Cacioppo, both of whom have completed more than 25 years service, simply because they are executive directors.
The remuneration committee intends to include the long-service awards in the policy which it will submit to shareholders for approval in 2017.
These will be calculated on the same basis as for all employees: an additional pension payment equivalent to 2% of salary for 2529 years service, a further 2% for 3034 years service and a further 2% at 35 years service with similarly staged 5% increments on SIPs.
In order to be able to make a payment to John Hutson and Su Cacioppo before the 2017 AGMs vote on policy, the remuneration committee is putting an ordinary resolution to shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
We believe that our remuneration policy continues to be fair and reasonable and aligns the interests of directors with those of the Company and its shareholders.
The remuneration report has been prepared based on the existing policy.
Further details are set out below, with shareholders invited to approve this report and proposals at the AGM on 10 November 2016.

An element of adjusted earnings per share growth including shares held in trust is included in this scheme, to reduce the potential volatility which may be inherent in relying purely on the owners earnings calculation, which is heavily influenced by maintenance capital expenditure.
Owners earnings are calculated as follows: Profit before tax: excluding unrealised exceptional items Add: Depreciation and amortisation Less: Cash reinvestment in current properties Less: Cash tax Equals: Owners earnings The maximum bonus to be earned under the scheme is 100% of annual salary.
