Governance Report on directors remuneration 85 Annual report on remuneration Although Experian plc is incorporated and registered in Jersey, we have drawn up this report in line with Schedule 8 of the UK Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2013, as well as the UK Financial Conduct Authority Listing Rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code.
Unless noted otherwise, all of the sections below are audited by the Companys external auditor, .
Set out below is the Annual report on remuneration, which will be put to shareholders for an advisory vote at the AGM on 20 July 2016.
What did we pay our executive directors during the year?
The following table shows the single total figure of remuneration for each executive director, in respect of the years ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015.
Further explanatory information is set out below.
The 2015 figures shown above reflect the change in remuneration which resulted from this change in role.
2 Lloyd Pitchford was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 1 October 2014 and the 2015 figures shown above reflect his remuneration from that date to 31 March 2015.
3 Kerry Williams joined the Board on 16 July 2014 and the 2015 figures shown above reflect his remuneration from that date to 31 March 2015.
The actual payment made during the course of the year reflects the timing of our US payroll.
How has the single figure been calculated?
Salary This figure represents the salary paid to executive directors during the year.
The Committee approved salary increases for executive directors of between 2.8% and 2.9% with effect from 1 April 2015: Salary from Salary to % increase 1 April 2015 31 March 2015 000 000 Brian Cassin 875 850 2.9% Lloyd Pitchford 540 525 2.9% Kerry Williams US$925 US$900 2.8% In awarding these increases, the Committee took into account a number of factors including prevailing economic conditions, positioning against the market and salary increases awarded across the wider employee population.
Benefits and pension Taxable benefits comprise the provision of life insurance, private healthcare, company car and payments in lieu of pension contributions.
Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford are eligible to participate in a defined contribution pension plan but elected not to do so during the year ended 31 March 2016.
In 2016, Brian Cassin received a cash supplement of 175,000 2015: 113,891, and Lloyd Pitchford received a cash supplement of 108,000 2015: 52,500, in lieu of their pension contributions.
The cash supplements were previously included in benefits but are now included in pensions.
Kerry Williams participates in a defined contribution plan 401k and the Company contribution to this during the year was US$12,254 2015: US$8,000.
No executive director has a prospective right to a defined benefit pension.
86 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Annual bonus Performance metrics Annual bonus outcomes depend on the Groups growth in Benchmark PBT at constant currency relative to stretching targets set at the start of the financial year.
We use Benchmark PBT because: as a profit growth metric, it reflects one of Experians key performance indicators: in line with Experians business strategy, it incentivises executives to generate returns for the business: and it is simple to understand and to measure.
For the purposes of the annual bonus, we measure Benchmark PBT growth on a constant currency basis, to strip out the effects of exchange rate fluctuations which are outside of managements control.
This is consistent with the approach we take for our longterm incentive plans.
The target setting process Each year when setting bonus targets, the Committee undertakes a rigorous exercise to ensure the targets are sufficiently stretching.
Before finalising them, it considers the strategic context and the targets at three separate meetings between January and May.
Targets are set in the context of the Groups strategic plan and approved budget.
The Committee takes into account a number of factors when setting the targets: Internal expectations External expectations Strategic plan Brokers earnings estimates Budget for the forthcoming year Wider economic expectations Current year performance Competitors earnings estimates Targets are structured as a sliding scale, with maximum awards only payable for achievement of significant levels of performance.
Performance target disclosure As our Benchmark PBT growth targets are set with reference to our strategic plan and budget, disclosing them could be useful to our competitors and may allow them to build up a picture of our strategic intentions, for example in terms of future areas of growth or acquisitions.
This could be potentially damaging to the Company and therefore not in the interests of our shareholders.
As a result, the Committee has historically taken the view not to disclose specific bonus target ranges.
However, following discussions with our key shareholders and major UK investor bodies, the Committee has reviewed its position and has decided in future to disclose the annual bonus targets one year following the completion of the relevant performance period.
This new approach will apply for the year commencing 1 April 2016 and these targets will be disclosed in the following years Report.
We believe that delaying disclosure by one year strikes an appropriate balance between protecting the commercial interests of Experian and its shareholders, and providing shareholders with greater transparency in respect of our targets.
Annual bonus outcomes The table below sets out our growth in Benchmark PBT for bonus purposes relative to our targets, and the resulting executive director annual bonus outcomes: Benchmark Achievement Bonus payout Bonus payout % of bonus PBT growth % of maximum % of salary deferred under 1 000 the CIP Brian Cassin 1,750 200% 100% Lloyd Pitchford 5.3% 100% 1,080 200% 100% Kerry Williams US$1,850 200% 100% 1 Bonus will be deferred into Experian shares under the CIP for a three-year period.
Deferred bonus shares are not subject to any further conditions.
The deferred bonuses may be matched with an award of shares of up to two times the value of the gross bonus deferred, subject to the performance conditions set out in the CIP awards section below being met as well as continued service.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 87 In determining the outcome for the annual bonus, the Committee considers whether the payouts adequately reflect the Groups wider business performance over the course of the year.
During the year, the Committee considered performance to be strong, particularly in the light of a number of factors, including: the challenging economic environment in Brazil over the past year, despite which our Brazilian business has delivered strong results: and market shifts in North America which have significantly affected our Consumer Services business and the actions taken by our leadership team to reposition the business which have seen a return to growth.
Despite these challenges, we achieved growth in Benchmark PBT of 5.3% at constant currency.
In the context of the Groups underlying performance during the year, the Committee was satisfied that this level of bonus payment was appropriate.
Share-based incentives The amount included in the single total figure of remuneration is the combined value of the CIP and PSP awards vesting in respect of the relevant financial year.
For 2015, these relate to the awards granted on 18 May 2012 and for 2016 they relate to the awards granted on 6 June 2013.
Vesting in 2016 for both the CIP and PSP awards depended on performance over the three years ended 31 March 2016 as well as continued service.
The performance achieved against the targets for CIP and PSP awards granted in June 2013 is shown in the following tables: CIP awards 1 Weighting Vesting Actual Percentage 2 vesting Performance measure No match 1:1 match 2:1 match Benchmark PBT annual growth 50% Below 7% 7% 14% 6.3% 0% 3 Cumulative operating cash flow 50% Below US$3.9bn US$4.3bn US$4.3bn 47.6% US$3.9bn Total 47.6% 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 The maximum opportunity was a 2 for 1 match on the bonus deferred.
3 T he Cumulative operating cash flow targets shown above have been increased from those originally set by US$115m to take into account the impact of acquisitions and disposals made over the performance period.
The actual Cumulative operating cash flow over the performance period, of US$4,276m, is determined on a constant currency basis.
This is in line with our approach for all performance metrics, to ensure that awards are measured on a consistent basis.
PSP awards 1 Weighting Vesting Actual Percentage 2 vesting Performance measure 0% 25% 100% Benchmark PBT annual growth 75% Below 7% 7% 14% 6.3% 0% TSR of Experian vs TSR of FTSE 100 Index 25% Below index Equal to index 25% above 6.8% above 11.3% Index Index Total 11.3% 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 The maximum opportunity was the original award with a face value of 200% and 175% of salary for Brian Cassin and Kerry Williams respectively.
Vesting of these awards was also subject to the Committee agreeing that the return on capital employed ROCE performance over the period was satisfactory.
Year-end ROCE was 15.4%, and so the Committee was comfortable that the payout determined by applying the performance criteria was appropriate in the context of this level of performance.
88 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued As these awards had not vested at the date this Report was finalised, the reported value of the awards is based on the average share price in the last three months of the financial year to 31 March 2016, which was 11.67.
The value of the awards, included in the single total figure of remuneration, is as follows: CIP PSP Value of Value of Total shares dividend value of Shares Shares Shares Shares 1 vesting equivalent shares awarded vesting awarded vesting 2 payments vesting 000 000 000 Brian Cassin 113,008 53,791 76,827 8,700 729 45 774 Kerry Williams 105,278 50,112 58,606 6,636 US$947 US$64 US$1,011 1 The value of the shares has been converted into US dollars for Kerry Williams at a rate of 1:US$1.4304, which is the average rate during the last three months of the financial year.
2 Dividend equivalents of 113.25 US cents per share will be paid on vested shares.
These represent the value of the dividends that would have been paid to the owner of one share between the date of grant and the date of vesting.
Buyout awards for Lloyd Pitchford As previously disclosed, Lloyd Pitchford was granted a number of replacement share incentive awards buyout awards on joining Experian in 2014 to compensate him for the long-term incentive awards he forfeited upon leaving his previous employer.
Whilst the Committee aimed to replicate as closely as possible the structure and vesting dates of the share awards forfeited, it was also mindful of shareholders views that vesting periods should be a minimum of 12 months and that performance conditions should be applied to awards.
Full details of the awards granted are disclosed in the 2015 Report on directors remuneration.
As disclosed in the table below, two tranches of these awards vested during the year: Shares awarded Shares vesting Vesting date Share price Value on vesting Value of dividend Total value of on vesting equivalent shares vesting payments 1 000 000 000 38,394 38,394 1 October 2015 10.69 410 10 420 29,123 29,123 5 March 2016 12.14 354 10 364 764 20 784 1 Dividend equivalents of 39.25 US cents per share and 51.75 US cents per share were payable on the awards vesting in October 2015 and March 2016 respectively.
The vesting of these awards was subject to satisfactory financial and business performance over the vesting period and the achievement of personal objectives.
Prior to approving the vesting of these awards, the Committee considered Lloyd Pitchfords performance in relation to his personal objectives since appointment, as well as the Groups general financial and business performance which is summarised in the Remuneration at a glance section of this Report, and determined that both of these conditions had been achieved.
Full vesting of these awards was therefore considered appropriate.
Update to 2015 disclosure The value of the share awards realised by Brian Cassin and Kerry Williams in 2015 was originally calculated using the average share price from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2015, in accordance with the prescribed single figure methodology.
This has now been revised to reflect the actual share price on vesting, as follows: Three-month Estimated value of longShare price on vesting Actual value of long-term average share price to term incentive awards incentive awards 31 March 2015 Brian Cassin 0.498m 0.527m 11.54 12.25 Kerry Williams US$2.458m US$2.698m Governance Report on directors remuneration 89 What share-based incentive awards did we make in the year?
On 21 May 2015, awards were granted to the executive directors under the CIP and the PSP.
The face value of awards made to Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford is given in sterling, and the face value of awards made to Kerry Williams in US dollars, using the average exchange rate for the three days prior to grant of 1:US$1.5561.
In line with the rules of the Experian Co-investment Plan, invested shares for Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford were purchased with their bonuses net of tax.
In line with the rules of the Experian North America Co-investment Plan, invested shares for Kerry Williams were calculated with reference to his gross bonus.
The matching awards are based on the gross value of the bonus deferred.
The details are set out in the following table.

2 The number of shares awarded to Kerry Williams under the Experian North America Co-investment Plan and to all three executive directors under the PSP was based on the average share price for the three days prior to grant, which was 12.41.
These awards will vest relative to the following performance conditions: CIP 1 Performance measure Weighting Vesting No match 1:1 match 2:1 match Benchmark PBT per share annual growth 50% Below 4% 4% 8% Cumulative operating cash flow 50% Below US$3.6bn US$3.6bn US$4.0bn 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
The vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to vary the level of vesting if it considers that the level of vesting determined by measuring performance is inconsistent with the Groups underlying financial and operational performance.

90 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued The vesting of awards will be subject to the Committee agreeing that ROCE performance is satisfactory and that vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
The Committee selected Benchmark PBT per share, Cumulative operating cash flow and ROCE as performance metrics for our longterm incentive plans, as they reflect three of our key performance indicators.
The use of these metrics therefore provides a direct link to Experians strategic aims.
The use of relative TSR recognises the importance of returning value to shareholders.

Governance Report on directors remuneration 91 How is our CEOs pay linked to Experians performance?
not audited The chart below shows Experians annual TSR performance against the FTSE 100 Index over the last seven years.
The FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be measured, as it is widely used and understood.
Experian is a constituent of the index.

How has the CEOs pay changed compared to the wider workforce?
not audited The following table sets out the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and annual bonus between 2015 and 2016, and how this compares to the average percentage change for our UK and Ireland employees.
Consistent with the approach used in previous years, the Committee has selected this group of employees to illustrate the comparison because Experian is a UK listed company and has widely varying approaches to pay across different geographic regions.
This also avoids the complexities, including the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, involved in collating remuneration data across different geographic populations.
As an example of the varying practices across the different countries in which we operate, salary review budgets for 2016 ranged between 1.7% and 25%.
Brian Cassin was appointed CEO part-way through 2015 and in order to provide a comparison with the full-year figures for 2016 his salary, benefits and annual bonus for the period between 16 July 2014 and 31 March 2015 have been annualised.
The figures for UK and Ireland employees reflect average salaries and average employee numbers each year.
The annual bonus figure includes payments from sales incentive plans.

As such, the value shown for share-based incentives was based on the average share price during the last three months of the financial year of 11.54, in line with the prescribed single figure methodology.
The share price on the vesting date was 12.25, and the share-based incentive figure shown in the table above has been updated accordingly.
Data for 2016 includes the value of PSP and CIP matching share awards granted to him in 2013 and which will vest in June 2016.
As these awards had not vested at the date this Report was finalised, the value of the awards presented is based on the average share price during the last three months of the financial year, which was 11.67, with further details given in the table below: CIP PSP Value of shares Value of dividend Total value vesting equivalent of shares vesting Shares Shares Shares Shares payments awarded vesting awarded vesting 000 000 000 251,980 119,942 76,828 8,700 1,492 93 1,585 Don Robert was originally awarded 172,864 shares under the PSP and these were adjusted on a pro-rata basis to 76,828 when he ceased to be an executive director.
No adjustment was made to the matching shares awarded under the CIP.
This treatment was in line with the Plans rules.
The CIP and PSP awards vested at 47.6% and 11.3% respectively, based on the same performance outcomes which applied to the awards made to the executive directors, as described in the Share-based incentives section of this Report.
Don Robert receives an unfunded pension payment from the Group of 420,945 per annum.
2 Fabiola Arredondo stepped down from the Board on 31 January 2016.
3 Jan Babiak resigned from the Board on 13 January 2016.
4 Roger Davis was appointed as independent Chairman of Experian Limited, which is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, on 15 February 2016.
His remuneration comprises an annual non-executive directors fee including a fee for his role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and a fee for his role as independent Chairman of Experian Limited.
5 Alan Jebson retired from the Board on 22 July 2015.
6 Luiz Fleury joined the Board on 8 September 2015.
His remuneration comprises an annual non-executive directors fee and fees for the provision of independent advice to Seresa S. A. our Brazilian business.
7 In October 2015 the Irish Revenue Commissioners concluded a review of the tax treatment of certain travel and subsistence expenses for non-Irish resident non-executive directors.
They confirmed that such expenses were to be treated as non-taxable from 1 January 2016.
As a result of this decision, and consistent with the approach taken in previous years, these expenses are not disclosed as benefits in the table above.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 93 During the year, the Board reviewed the fees of the non-executive directors, as it normally does every two years, and approved the following fee increases which took effect from 1 October 2015: Fee effective Previous fee 1 October 2015 Base fee 142,500 132,500 Audit Committee Chairman fee 43,000 40,000 Remuneration Committee Chairman fee 34,500 32,000 Deputy Chairman Senior Independent Director fee 86,000 80,000 In approving the increases, the Committee took into consideration a number of factors, including market data and the scope and time requirement of the non-executive director role.
Non-executive directors required to undertake intercontinental travel to attend Board meetings receive a supplementary payment of 6,000 per trip, in addition to any travel expenses.
This amount is unchanged since October 2009.
How do we intend to implement the remuneration policy next year?
not audited Salary and fees In the past, executive director salary increases have taken effect from 1 April each year.
However, we have recently aligned pay review dates across the Group and as a result the following executive director salary increases will take effect from 1 June 2016: 1 June 2016 1 April 2015 % increase Brian Cassin 900,000 875,000 2.9% Lloyd Pitchford 555,000 540,000 2.8% Kerry Williams US$950,000 US$925,000 2.7% The increases awarded to our executive directors are in line with increases awarded to the wider employee population across the Group.
On Don Roberts appointment as Chairman in July 2014, his annual fee was set at 600,000, and it was agreed that the first review of this fee would take place on 1 April 2016.
However, he indicated to the Committee that he did not wish to be considered for a fee increase at that time, and so the Chairmans fee will next be reviewed on 1 April 2017.
Fees for other non-executive directors are next due to be reviewed on 1 October 2017.
Annual bonus The Committees approach to operating the annual bonus plan for the year ending 31 March 2017 will be unchanged from 2016.
As disclosed earlier in the Report, the Committee has decided to disclose annual bonus targets on a retrospective basis.
As such, the targets for the year commencing 1 April 2016 will be disclosed in the following years Report, when we believe that their commercial sensitivity will have reduced.
94 Governance Report on directors remuneration Annual report on remuneration continued Share-based incentives CIP and PSP The executive directors have elected to defer 100% of their bonuses into the CIP.
Matching shares, equivalent to 200% of the gross deferred bonus, are expected to be granted in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2017.
These will vest subject to satisfying the following performance conditions, which will be measured over a three-year performance period: 1 Weighting Vesting Performance measure No match 1:1 match 2:1 match 2 Benchmark PBT per share annual growth 50% Below 4% 4% 8% 2 Cumulative operating cash flow 50% Below US$3.6bn US$3.6bn US$4bn 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
2 Measured on a continuing activities and constant currency basis.
The vesting of CIP awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to vary the level of vesting if it considers the level of vesting determined by measuring performance to be inconsistent with the Groups underlying financial and operational performance.
PSP awards equivalent to 200% of salary are expected to be granted in the first quarter of the year ending 31 March 2017.
These will vest subject to satisfying the following performance conditions, which will be measured over a three-year performance period: 1 Weighting Vesting Performance measure 0% 25% 100% 2 Benchmark PBT per share annual growth 75% Below 4% 4% 8% TSR of Experian vs TSR of FTSE 100 Index 25% Below Index Equal to Index 25% above Index 1 Straight-line vesting between the points shown.
The vesting of PSP awards will be subject to the Committee agreeing that ROCE performance is satisfactory and that vesting is not based on financial results which have been materially misstated.
In addition, the Committee has the discretion to vary the level of vesting if it considers this to be inappropriate in the context of the Groups underlying financial and operational performance.
Both CIP and PSP awards will be subject to clawback provisions, whereby the Company may recover all or part of any vested award, at any time during the 12 months following the end of the performance period.
Additional disclosures Directors shareholding and share interests The Committee believes it is important that executive directors build up a significant holding in Experian shares to align their interests with those of shareholders.
The Committee has therefore established guidelines under which the CEO should hold the equivalent of three times his base salary in Experian shares and other executive directors should hold two times their base salary.
These guidelines include invested or deferred shares held under the CIP but not matching shares.
Until the shareholding guideline is met, an executive director is expected to retain at least 50% of any shares vesting net of tax under a share award.
Unvested shares are not taken into account in determining whether the guideline has been met.
After joining the Board, Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford are building their shareholdings up to the level required by the guidelines.
Experian also has guidelines for its non-executive directors to build up a holding in the Companys shares equal to their annual Experian plc non-executive directors fee.
Each financial year, the first quarters net fee is used to purchase Experian shares until the non-executive director reaches this holding.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 95 The interests of the directors and their connected persons in the Companys ordinary shares are shown below and there have been no changes between 31 March 2016 and the date of this Report: Shares held in Shareholding guidelines Share awards subject to PSP awards Experian plc at performance conditions not subject to 4 31 March 2016 performance 3 Guideline Shareholding Guideline met?
2 Matching shares granted to Brian Cassin and Lloyd Pitchford are in the form of nil-cost options, which are unvested at 31 March 2016.
Those granted to Kerry Williams are conditional share awards.
3 Except for 13,705 shares awarded to Lloyd Pitchford on 17 November 2014 to replace outstanding awards from his previous employer, awards under the PSP are subject to Benchmark PBT and relative TSR performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing at the start of the financial year of grant, and are also subject to a financial performance underpin.
The shares awarded to Lloyd Pitchford in November 2014 will vest subject to satisfactory financial and business performance and the achievement of his individual performance objectives.
4 O n 18 May 2012 Brian Cassin was granted a recruitment award as a replacement for outstanding awards received from his previous employer.
The final 31,422 shares comprising the award are due to vest on 25 January 2017.
These are not subject to performance conditions and vest subject only to continued employment.
5 The number of Experian shares held by Brian Cassin at 31 March 2016 includes 77,281 invested shares in the CIP and for Lloyd Pitchford includes 23,007 invested shares in the CIP.
6 The number of Experian shares held by Kerry Williams at 31 March 2016 includes 128,917 shares, and for Don Robert includes 215,607 shares, awarded to them under the Experian North America Co-investment Plan as a result of their annual bonus deferral elections, in addition to their personal beneficial shareholding.
