62 Galliford Try plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016 Remuneration Policy and Report Committee Chairs annual statement The principal work of the Committee this year has been to review the Groups long-term incentive plans at executive and senior manager level to ensure they remain relevant to the needs of the Group.
As our current Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP approaches the end of its 10-year life, we will table a new LTIP to shareholders for approval at the AGM this November.
The plan is broadly unchanged from the existing LTIP, with changes made to reflect current market and best practice.
The Group performed well over the year, as highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report, and accordingly we are confident that there remains a strong link between individual reward and business performance.
Details regarding the specific variable elements of pay received by the executive directors can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 74.
These payments reflect another year of The principal work of the Committee strong performance delivered for shareholders in pursuit of the this year has been to review the design of strategy of disciplined and sustainable growth.
the Groups long-term incentive plans at As to the application of the approved Remuneration Policy for the present financial year, the Committee continues to monitor and executive and senior manager level to ensure review pay and conditions across the Group, and in particular the that the new plan proposed to shareholders wider executive population immediately beneath the senior team.

the intention that awards will be increased to an aggregate 3% over the year ahead.
Further details regarding salary increases awarded Ishbel Macpherson to Peter Truscott and Graham Prothero which were in line with Remuneration Committee Chair average increases across the workforce, together with the changed arrangements following Greg Fitzgeralds assumption of a Non-executive Chairmans role, can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
As a result of the outcome of the recent EU referendum, which has set the UK on a path to leave the EU, a degree of uncertainty prevails, and may continue to do so for some time.
The Committee feels that it does not have sufficient clarity on the likely impact on the housebuilding and construction sectors to enable it to set meaningful three-year targets.
Given that LTIP awards will not be made unless shareholders approve the Plan Rules at the AGM in November, the Committee has decided to delay setting targets for these awards until closer to the grant date.
The targets attached to the 2016 17 LTIP awards are therefore not set out in this report but will instead be disclosed in the relevant RNS announcement, as well as in the 2016 17 Directors Remuneration Report.
The awards will be made in line with the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy and the Committee will consult with major shareholders if any significant changes to the performance measures are proposed.
The Committee has also considered the structure of FY 2017 Annual Bonus Plan in order to fairly balance the incentivisation of management and the interests of shareholders in this uncertain period.
The targets have been simplified to focus purely on profit and cash and the stretch between threshold and target performance has been widened, as has the stretch between target and maximum performance.
Target performance has not been changed in light of the outcome of the EU referendum.
These targets will be fully disclosed in next years Directors Remuneration Report.
The changes we are proposing under the new LTIP rules are all within the existing Remuneration Policy as approved by shareholders in 2014, and this preparatory work stands us in good stead for our review of the Policy for 2017-20, which we will commence in the coming year.
This process will include any necessary consultation with shareholders before presentation of the Policy to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
