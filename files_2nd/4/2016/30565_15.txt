DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Statement from the Chairman I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2016.
An ordinary resolution to approve the Directors remuneration report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The Companys auditor is required to verify certain information within this report subject to statutory audit by the Companies Act 2006.
Where information set out below has been audited, it is indicated as such.
As at 31 December 2016 and the date of this report, the Board consists entirely of independent nonexecutive directors and the Company has no employees.
The Directors fees for the year are set out as follows: 40,000 per annum for the Chairman, 32,000 per annum for the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 27,000 for the other Directors.
The Board took the decision not to increase the Directors' fees at this stage in the Company's development.
Directors remuneration policy An ordinary resolution to approve the Directors remuneration policy was duly passed at the Companys AGM held on 9 May 2016.
There will be no significant change in the way the approved remuneration policy will be implemented in the course of the next financial year.
The key elements of the remuneration policy are summarised below: The fees for the Board as a whole are limited to 500,000 per annum in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The current total annual fee, excluding expenses, is 148,816.
Directors fees are set to reflect the experience and responsibilities of the Board and the time commitment required, and to ensure that the Company can attract individuals of a suitable calibre appropriate to promote the long-term success of the Company.
Board members are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other non-cash benefits.
No other payments are made to Directors, other than reasonable expenses for attending to the Companys affairs and nothing is payable to the Directors by way of exit payment or loss-of-office compensation.
The Directors may from time to time perform special services, which are likely to be exceptional and would result in additional consultancy payments.
Such fees would be set at the market rate.
Shareholders have the opportunity to express their views in respect of Directors remuneration at the AGM.
Any comment will be carefully considered by the Board.
Remuneration is reviewed on an annual basis and third-party information is considered.
An  review of remuneration is carried out every three years.
None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company: they are all engaged under letters of appointment.
The full version of the approved remuneration policy can be viewed on the Companys website.
