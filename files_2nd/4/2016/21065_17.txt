As our 2014 Policy comes to the end of its three-year life-cycle, we are required to put a new Remuneration Policy forward to a shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM.
During 2016, we consulted our major shareholders and their representatives extensively on executive remuneration and we would like to thank those who took part in this process.

2 Shares awarded to Mr Soriot in 2013 under the AZIP to compensate him for LTIs from previous employment which were forfeited on his recruitment as the Companys CEO as previously disclosed to shareholders in the 2013 Directors Remuneration Report and the cash equivalent of dividends accrued on those AZIP shares during the performance period, payable on vesting.
3 Cash equivalent of the dividends accrued on shares deferred under the annual bonus awarded in respect of 2012, paid during the year on the completion of the bonus share deferral period.
Notes to the Executive Directors single total figure remuneration table Taxable benets Executive Directors may select benets within the Companys UK Flexible Benets Programme or can select to take all, or any remaining allowance after the selection of benets, in cash.
In 2016, the Executive Directors principally took the allowance in cash 103,000 in respect of Mr Soriot and 54,000 in respect of Mr Dunoyer and selected other benets including healthcare insurance, death-in-service provision and advice in relation to tax.
2016 Annual bonus The CEO had a target annual bonus of 100% of base salary range 0-180% and the CFO had a target annual bonus of 90% of base salary range 0-150%.
One-third of the pre-tax bonuses shown will be deferred into Ordinary Shares which will vest three years from the date of deferral, subject to continued employment.
The bonus is not pensionable.
The precise targets or target ranges set at the beginning of the performance period are closely aligned to the Companys strategic priorities, set out in the Group scorecard.
As in prior years, we have set out below the targets for 2016 in respect of the Achieve Group financial targets element of the annual bonus and Company performance against those targets.
In addition, we have provided the outcomes under each of the Achieve scientific leadership and Return to growth targets.
While, in the judgement of the Board, the targets themselves under these areas remain commercially sensitive, we remain committed to making retrospective disclosure of these targets when they are no longer considered to be commercially sensitive.
It is anticipated that targets will be disclosed two years after the end of the performance period as has been done for the 2014 annual bonus targets which are set out on page 114.
The 2016 bonus for both Executive Directors was below their individual target and was determined by applying the Group scorecard outcome directly to their target.
The Group scorecard outcome was 98% and consequently the Committee determined that Mr Soriots annual bonus should amount to 98% of base salary, representing 54.4% of his potential maximum, and that Mr Dunoyers bonus should amount to 88.2% of base salary, representing 58.8% of his potential maximum.
Achieve Group financial targets These targets are based on the Companys key financial measures.
Cash ow performance in 2016 was strong and the target was exceeded.
The Core EPS and Revenue outcomes were below target Core EPS performance was within the performance range and resulted in a below target payout.
There will be no payout related to Revenue performance, which was below the threshold level set for that measure.

Achieve scientific leadership These targets reect the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market.
In 2016, we continued to make progress towards achieving scientific leadership.
The AstraZeneca pipeline includes 132 projects, of which 120 are in the clinical phase of development.
There are 12 NME projects currently in late-stage development, either in Phase III pivotal Phase II studies or under regulatory review.
During 2016, across the portfolio, 48 projects successfully progressed to their next phase.
This includes four first approvals in a major market, and 15 NME progressions.
In addition, 17 projects have entered Phase I and 22 projects have been discontinued.
The Committee and the Science Committee assessed the substance of the achievements and concluded a fair and balanced outcome was 15 Phase II starts progressions versus 16 as reported in the KPI section on page 16 and 13 NME and major life-cycle management submissions versus 14 as reported in the KPI section.

Return to growth These targets are based on quantitative sales targets for 2016 relating to the Companys Growth Platforms: Brilinta Brilique, CVMD, Respiratory, New Oncology, Emerging Markets, and Japan.
In 2016, the New Oncology therapy area performed well, exceeding target, and Japan met its target.
The other Return to growth platform outcomes were below target reecting a number of challenges in meeting these stretching targets.

Individual performance Although the performance targets in the Group scorecard drive prima facie bonus outcomes, the Committee also applies judgement to assess the Executive Directors individual performance.
Our Executive Directors delivered 2016 business performance in line with expectations and against stretching performance targets, while managing a number of factors that impacted 2016 Product Sales and Total Revenue, such as pricing pressure and new competition from Crestor generic medicines.
Strong leadership from our Executive Directors has enabled significant achievements such as the strategic prioritisation of scientific projects leading to the acceleration of a number of important opportunities and an organisational transformation to support entrepreneurial and agile teams focused on the most critical business priorities while delivering a 12% reduction in Core SG&A expense 9% at CER and continuing to invest in R&D.
When considering our Executive Directors individual performance and the business performance overall, the Committee decided a Group scorecard outcome of 98% represents a fair and balanced reection of performance in a challenging year and that no upward or downward adjustment to the bonus outcomes for either Executive Director was required.

Description of interest An award over shares.
The vesting date is the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to performance over a three-year period commencing on 1 January in the year of the award and a two-year holding period commencing three years from the date of grant, and continued employment.
The award is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
Awards are weighted 75% in favour of the PSP and 25% in favour of the AZIP.
Basis of award 427.5% of base salary.

The rank which the Companys TSR achieves over the performance period will determine how many shares will vest under the part of the award subject to the TSR performance measure.
Payouts against performance in relation to TSR for PSP awards are expressed as a percentage of the maximum award currently payable, shown within a range of 0% to 100%, as shown in the table below.
TSR ranking of the Company PSP awards made in 2016 % of award under TSR performance measure that vests Below median 0% Median 25% Between median and upper quartile Pro rata Upper quartile 75% Above upper quartile 75% to 100% at the Committees discretion More information about the TSR performance of the Company, including the Companys peer group, is set out in the Total shareholder return section on page 113.
Twenty five percent of the award is based on the achievement of a cumulative free cash ow target.
The measure for the cash ow target for the PSP awards made in 2016 is net cash ow before distributions and other adjustments required by the performance conditions subject to any further adjustments the Committee chooses to make using its judgement and thus referred to as adjusted cumulative cash ow, over the same three-year performance period as the TSR performance measure, and the level of vesting for the part of the award subject to the cash ow performance measure is based on a sliding scale between a threshold cash ow target and an upper target.
Vesting levels in relation to the threshold target and the upper target are shown in the table below.
Adjusted cumulative cash ow PSP awards made in 2016 % of award under cash ow performance measure that vests Less than $9bn 0% $9bn 25% Between $9bn and $11bn Pro rata $11bn 75% Between $11bn and $13.5bn Pro rata $13.5bn and above 100% Twenty five percent of the award is based on Return to growth measures based on achievement of an aggregate revenue target relating to the Companys Growth Platforms.
Aggregate revenue of Growth Platforms PSP awards made in 2016 % of award under Return to growth performance measure that vests $17bn 25% $20bn 100% Twenty five percent of the award is based on Achieve scientific leadership measures covering five areas: an NME target, which reects the Companys ability to deliver innovation to the market: major life-cycle management approvals, which represent a good proxy for near-to-mid term growth: the volume of NMEs in Phase III and their registration: a target for peak-year sales, to track the value of pipeline output: and delivery from our research and early development organisation, assessed by Phase II starts.
As the PSP performance measures related to Achieve scientific leadership are an indicator of the Companys longer-term strategic priorities, we believe that the targets target ranges associated with them are commercially sensitive.
We will make retrospective disclosure when the targets are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive, which we currently anticipate to be immediately following the end of the performance period.
More information about the PSPs performance measures is set out on page 125 of the Remuneration Policy Report.

In 2015, we simplied the PSP for awards made in 2016 by replacing the six Return to growth performance targets with one aggregate sales target for our Growth Platforms and increased transparency in our reporting by disclosing the target for that measure at the start of the performance period, in line with our aim to strike the right balance between transparency in our reporting on executive pay and protecting our commercially sensitive information.
In 2016, the Chairman of the Committee consulted with our major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies on executive remuneration.
The feedback we received has informed the Committees approach to executive remuneration in 2017, with further detail set out in the Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee from page 103 and the Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017 section from page 117.
Based on our shareholder consultation we believe that the changes made to the Committees approach to executive remuneration in 2017 will closely align our reward mechanisms with the experience of shareholders.
We intend to continue the dialogue with our major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies during the course of 2017 as the Companys strategy and business needs evolve, to ensure executive reward remains aligned to the delivery of sustainable value for our shareholders.

The Committee conducted a review of its terms of reference during 2016 and recommended minor changes including an express reference to the regular tender for the services of the Committees independent adviser.
The Board approved this recommendation.
Basis of preparation of this Directors Remuneration Report This Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the Regulations and meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.
As required by the Regulations, resolutions to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration and the Directors Remuneration Policy will be proposed at the AGM on 27 April 2017.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017 This section sets out how the Committee intends to implement our Remuneration Policy in 2017.
Changes to LTI plans From 1 January 2017, LTI plans will be simplied: no new awards will be made under the AZIP so LTI awards for Executive Directors will only be made under the PSP.
The performance measures and weightings for 2017 PSP awards are set out in the table overleaf.
Taking into account shareholder feedback, a number of changes have been made to the PSPs performance measures: The level of vesting for threshold performance has been reduced from 25% to 20% of maximum for all measures.
The TSR peer group will be increased from 10 to 18 companies.
The new peer group provides a better comparison in terms of revenue, innovative portfolio and geographical presence.
The TSR peer group is set out in the Summary of Executive Directors remuneration for 2017 section on page 118.
We have introduced a Reported EBITDA measure.
In selecting Reported EBITDA, the Committee has addressed a general concern about the pharmaceutical industrys use of core earnings for incentive purposes.
Further to this, in line with our aim to increase transparency and accountability in our reporting, we have disclosed the targets for this measure at the start of the performance period.
The number of measures under the Achieve scientific leadership element has been reduced from five to three measures ensuring focus on late-stage value creation.
For AZIP awards that still have performance years to run in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Committee is responding to concerns expressed by some shareholders that the AZIP may incentivise decision making that is strongly focused on short-term earnings, by introducing a simple pro rata sliding scale to assess performance for the outstanding AZIP awards.
If a performance target is missed in any one year, instead of every outstanding AZIP award failing, only 25% will fail reecting the fact that only one of the four performance years has failed.
The Committee believes that this sliding scale directly addresses shareholder concerns and will provide a good balance between challenging and achievable targets.
Executive Directors remuneration opportunity for 2017 Effective from 1 January 2017, Mr Soriots base salary was increased, in line with increases in the UK employee population, by 2.5% to 1,220,000.
For performance in line with the Companys expectations, Mr Soriots overall remuneration opportunity will remain unchanged at 100% of base salary for his annual bonus, and 250% of base salary for his LTI award.
Effective from 1 January 2017, Mr Dunoyers base salary was increased, in line with increases in the UK employee population, by 2.5% to 725,000.
For performance in line with the Companys expectations, Mr Dunoyers overall remuneration opportunity will also remain unchanged at 90% of base salary for his annual bonus, and 200% of base salary for his LTI award.
Awards under the PSP have an expected value of 50%, whereas the expected value that has been used when making AZIP awards has been 100%.
A consequence of awarding shares entirely under the PSP is that the value that could potentially be delivered to Mr Dunoyer for maximum performance under the LTI has increased from 350% of base salary to 400% at face value.
There is no increase in Mr Soriots maximum remuneration opportunity under the LTI which remains at 500% at face value.
The annual bonus measures and weightings for 2017 are set out in the table overleaf and are broadly consistent with those applicable in 2016.
Individual performance for each of the Executive Directors will be assessed by reference to individual objectives in line with the Companys objectives for the year.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 121 Corporate Governance Remuneration Policy This section sets out the Remuneration Policy the Policy proposed for approval by shareholders at the Companys AGM in April 2017.
Subject to shareholder approval, the Policy is intended to remain in effect for three years from the 2017 AGM.
There are two substantive differences between the previous policy approved by shareholders in April 2014 and the proposed Policy: i the level of LTI vesting at threshold performance will be reduced from 25% to 20% of maximum: and ii no new awards will be made under the AZIP so, from 2017, LTI awards for Executive Directors will only be made under the PSP.
For the outstanding AZIP awards that still have performance years to run in 2017, 2018 and 2019, a simple pro rata sliding scale will be used to assess performance against unchanged targets.
In addition, the Policy has been drafted more concisely and is shorter than the previous policy.
Setting remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specic remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group.
Remuneration for all roles within the organisation is benchmarked against that for comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employees local market to ensure the Company is paying fairly at all levels.
Executive Directors remuneration is benchmarked against a global pharmaceutical peer group and the FTSE30.
Each year, the Company engages with employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, to solicit feedback generally on a wide range of matters, including pay.
While the Committee does not consult employees when setting the Executive Directors remuneration policy, it does review Group remuneration data annually, including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay: bonus data: and gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation.
Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore have the opportunity to vote at the 2017 AGM on the Policy.
In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Directors local market in the relevant year.
In all aspects of its work, the Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders.
It consults the Companys major investors on general and specic remuneration matters and provides opportunities for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Committee and other Committee and Board members.
It is the Companys policy to seek input from major shareholders on an ad hoc basis when significant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed.
The Companys shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and any views expressed will be considered by Committee members.
The Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Groups remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, management of risk, and the pursuit of the Companys business objectives.
Legacy arrangements The Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofce on terms that differ to the terms in the Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect or were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the agreement was not entered into in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Committee in connection with such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration including share awards, in line with the terms agreed at the time the award was granted.
Minor amendments The Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for Directors described in the Policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation.

bonus plan awards on cessation of employment section on page 131. of the Companys strategy.
Performance targets are set by the Committee at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
They are closely aligned to the Companys strategy and are designed to reward scientific, commercial and financial success.
Performance is currently assessed against a combination of five measures: TSR: cash ow: reported EBITDA: sales of medicines in key therapy areas and territories: and innovation metrics.
If the Committee was to propose any material changes to the PSP performance targets, it would consult major shareholders in advance.
When setting performance targets, the Committee allocates such weightings to the targets as it considers appropriate, taking into account strategic priorities.
The intention of the Committee is to exercise appropriate judgement, in particular so that the experience of shareholders over time is taken into account.
Performance is assessed over the three-year period commencing on 1 January in the year of grant.
Shares are then subject to a two-year holding period following the performance period, so full vesting takes place on the fifth anniversary of grant.
During the holding period, no further performance measures apply.
Payout under the PSP can range from 0% to 100% of the original award.
All PSP performance targets have a payout curve.
Each payout curve is structured to suit the objective it is intended to measure and the relationship between threshold, target and out-performance is determined at grant.
Typically, 20% of the proportion of a PSP award linked to a performance target will vest on the achievement of threshold level of performance and 100% will vest if the target level of performance is achieved.
For relative measures such as relative TSR the threshold level of performance associated with a target will be performance at or above median.
The maximum level of performance will usually be set as achievement of performance at the upper quartile level.
Where the performance target permits, there will be further vesting points between threshold and maximum vesting levels, with vesting typically taking place on a straight-line basis.
The Committee may acting fairly and reasonably adjust or waive a performance target if an event occurs that causes it to believe that the performance target is no longer appropriate.
On vesting, the cash value equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the vesting shares during the performance and holding periods will be paid to the Director.
For awards granted in 2015 and for subsequent years, the Committee has discretion: to reduce or cancel any portion of an unvested award in certain circumstances malus, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual for up to six years from the third anniversary of the date of grant, to claw-back from individuals some or all of the award in certain circumstances, including i material restatement of the results of the Group, ii significant reputational damage to the Group, or iii serious misconduct by the individual.

There are three extant AZIP awards which were granted to the Executive Directors in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
Vesting of these awards is dependent on the achievement of two performance targets measured over a four-year performance period commencing on 1 January in the year of grant.
Shares are subject to a four-year holding period following the performance period, so vesting takes place on the eighth anniversary of the start of the performance period.
Payout of the award is subject to continued employment as further described in the Treatment of LTI and deferred bonus plan awards on cessation of employment section on page 131.
The performance targets are dividend level and dividend cover.
If both targets are achieved in each year of the performance period, the award will vest in full at the end of the holding period.
Twenty five percent of an award will lapse for each year in which neither or only one target is achieved.

'LHUHQFHV LQ UHPXQHUDWLRQ SROLF IRU RWKHU HPSOR HHV The Companys approach to determining and reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors and the employee population as a whole is the same.
On an annual basis the salaries for individual roles are reviewed in the context of individual sustained performance and the external market.
AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust salary review process for all employees.
The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive benets, including pension, to all employees including Executive Directors in the context of their local market.
Employees at mid to senior levels globally are eligible for LTI awards in the form of the PSP and or restricted stock units.
The occupants of approximately 700 senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards these are the leaders who have the ability to directly inuence the execution of the Companys strategic goals.

In order to offer a competitive package to attract the most suitable candidate, the Committee may consider providing remuneration arrangements that exceed those of the existing Executive Directors and may agree to pay allowances to expatriates in line with the Companys international assignment policy to provide support towards housing, schooling and other relocation or assignment related costs.
The Committee will offer a remuneration package that it considers appropriate in the particular circumstances of the recruitment, giving due regard to the interests of the Companys shareholders and taking into account factors such as typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors, internal relativities and market positioning.
The pharmaceutical industry is global and future Executive Directors might be recruited from organisations with pay structures and practices that differ from AstraZenecas usual remuneration policy.
The Committee believes that it is in the interests of shareholders for it to retain an element of exibility in its approach to recruitment to enable it to attract the best candidates: however, this exibility is limited.
The Committee may nd it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements as a consequence of the recruit leaving his or her previous employment to join AstraZeneca.
Where such compensation is offered to a new recruit on his or her hire, the Committee will explain the rationale to shareholders in a timely manner and will provide details of the arrangement.
The value of such compensation will depend upon the circumstances of the recruitment and the individual in question.
The Committee will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company: however, the precise nature of the compensation arrangement will depend on the type of entitlement being forfeited, which the Committee will generally seek to compensate in kind.
The arrangement might therefore comprise cash and or restricted shares and or an LTI award.
The Committee will obtain and take into account independent valuations of the forfeited entitlements to determine the appropriate level of compensation.
All other aspects of a new recruits compensation opportunity will be subject to the maxima stated in the Policy.
The Committees intention is to use buyout awards for this compensatory purpose only.
A new recruit may be granted shares under an LTI plan within the Policy or under a plan specic to that individual, as permitted under the Financial Conduct Authoritys Listing Rules.
Vesting of such awards may be subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
The precise targets and measures will depend on the objectives of the Company and the individual at the time of the recruitment and will be determined by the Committee.
128 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2016 Corporate Governance Ongoing annual variable remuneration will not exceed an award which comprises up to 250% of base salary under the annual bonus, and up to 500% of base salary under the PSP.
If the Committee ever felt that it would be in the interests of shareholders to grant annual variable awards to a new Executive Director with values exceeding the historical maximum of 680% of base salary comprising up to 180% under the annual bonus and up to 500% in aggregate under the LTI, it would consult major shareholders in advance.
In the case of Group employees who are promoted internally to the position of Executive Director, the Committee intends to honour all remuneration arrangements entered into before the promotion.
The Company may reimburse the costs of financial planning and tax advice.
Service contracts for Executive Directors Save as noted below, it is not intended that service contracts for new Executive Directors will contain terms that are materially different from those summarised below or contained in the Policy set out in this Remuneration Policy Report.
The contractual obligations below are applicable to each of the current Executive Directors unless stated otherwise.
Notice period The Company may terminate employment by giving not less than 12 months written notice.

Summary The Company may terminate employment summarily in particular dened circumstances such as gross termination misconduct, with no further payment.
Payments in If, on termination, the Executive Director has exceeded their accrued holiday entitlement, the value of this excess lieu of holiday may be deducted by the Company from any sums payable.
If the Executive Director has unused holiday entitlement, the Committee has discretion to require the Executive Director to take such unused holiday during any notice period, or make a payment in lieu of it calculated in the same way as the value of any excess holiday.
