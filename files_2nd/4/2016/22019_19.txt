The Committee may also authorise the provision of outplacement services and pay reasonable legal expenses associated with the termination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years, which may be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a further three-year term.
The terms of appointment provide for a notice period in the event of early termination of six months for the Chairman and three months for other non-executive directors, other than if they are not re-elected at an AGM.
Details of contracts and letters of appointment, for directors serving at the date of this report, are as set out below: Non-executive Date of first appointment Notice period months Date of expiry of current contract 64 Governance Garry Watts 1 January 2012 6 31 December 2017 Giles Kerr 1 October 2007 3 30 September 2016 Ian Much 1 August 2010 3 31 July 2016 James OShea 2 April 2009 3 31 March 2017 Richard Wohanka 1 January 2013 3 31 December 2018 Susan Foden 1 March 2015 3 28 February 2018 Non-executive directors and Chairmans fees The table below summarises the Groups policy in relation to the fees of non-executive directors.

When reviewing fee levels, account is taken of market movements in non-executive director fees, Board committee responsibilities, ongoing time commitments and the general economic environment.
Additional fees may be paid where there is a material increase in the time commitment and responsibilities required of non-executive directors.
Fee increases, if applicable, are normally effective from 1 April each year.
Non-executives do not participate in any pension, bonus or share incentive plans and do not receive any benefits other than limited benefits relating to travel, accommodation and hospitality provided in relation to the performance of any directors duties and any tax thereon.
The Chairman, in consultation with the executive directors, is responsible for proposing changes to the non-executive directors fees.
The Senior Independent Director, in consultation with the executive directors, is responsible for proposing changes to the Chairmans fees.

In proposing such fees, account is also taken of the time commitments of the Groups non-executive directors.
The decision on fee changes is taken by the Board as a whole.
Individual non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their remuneration.

The share price used is the three month average share price to the end of the financial year.
For 2016 this figure does not include the 2013 Core PSP award as the Core and Multiplier awards are treated as a single award and the Core award will be shown in 2017 if no election is made and both Core and Multiplier in 2018 if an election is made.
If 50% of a Core award is rolled over into a Multiplier award 50% of the Core award will be shown in 2017 and the remainder is part of the Multiplier award in 2018.
The 2015 figure has been restated to reflect the actual share price on the date that the 2012 share options become exercisable 1 June 2015: 709.0p.
The LTIP figure for 2016 relates to the 6 July 2011 Core and 6 July 2014 Multiplier awards.
Share price appreciation over the five-year period to 31 March 2016 contributed materially to the total remuneration figure for 2016.

BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2016 audited For the year ended 31 March 2016 bonuses were subject to a maximum of 100% of base salary for executive directors and up to 75% for other senior staff.
Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom based on the achievement of certain objectives.
These were the achievement of targets for revenue growth, trading profit, cash generation and individual KPIs intended to drive future growth in the business.
The Committee set threshold and stretch as well as intermediate targets.
The bonus is calculated on base salary with a percentage pay out of between 25% at threshold, 50% at on-target and 100% at maximum.
The trading profit measure is a normalised measure relating to earnings before amortisation of intangibles, restructuring and acquisition costs, group foreign exchange movements and movements in derivatives.
The cashflow measure adjusts for restructuring and acquisition costs only.
The Remuneration Committee may adjust the final outcome upwards or downwards in the event that an exceptional event occurs, which, in the Committees opinion, materially affected the bonus out-turn.
During 2015 16 the Committee assessed that adjustments should be made for each of the following: i the positive impact from the foreign exchange translation: and ii the negative impact of the incremental amounts paid to purchase the residual financial interest of the originator of the Varithena foam sclerotherapy technology Cabrera purchase.
For the financial year to 31 March 2016 they are calculated as follows: Revenue Trading profit Cashflow m m m Revenue profit before tax operating cash flow 447.5 57.5 66.6 Adjustments to calculate trading profit: Derivatives and group foreign exchange movements 1.7 Amortisation of business combination intangibles 35.0 Fair value adjustment on PneumRx inventory 1.5 67 Fair value adjustment on business combination contingent considerations 1.4 Governance Adjusted revenue trading profit operating cash flow 447.5 94.3 66.6 Remuneration Committee adjustments: Translational foreign exchange impacts 25.7 12.4 Cabrera purchase 2.0 23.0 Adjusted revenue trading profit operating cash flow for bonus purposes 421.8 83.9 89.6 The performance achieved against the bonus targets are summarised as follows: Performance required Louise Makin Rolf Soderstrom As a percentage of maximum Pay out Cash Pay out Cash bonus Threshold Target Stretch Actual Measure opportunity m m m m % of salary % of salary Corporate Financial Targets 1 Revenue 23 3% 410.0 425.0 441.2 421.8 10.5% 10.5% 1 Trading profit 23 3% 72.5 80.5 86.7 83.9 18% 18% 1 Operating cashflow 23 3% 8.7 19.5 31.1 89.6 23.3% 23.3% Individual Corporate Objectives 30% Covering execution across the business 23% 23% segments including relating to R&D and Innovation: developing organisational capabilities and leadership: and progression of the Interventional Medicine strategy including early phase assets.

Deferred share bonus plan awards are structured as conditional awards over shares, to be held for three years.
The level of deferral under the policy in operation for the 2015 bonus year is dependent on the achievement of the share ownership guidelines with no deferral if the guidelines have been met.
As both executive directors have achieved the guideline levels, bonuses for 2015 have been paid in cash.
Following changes to the policy, commencing with the financial year ending 31 March 2017, the first 75% of salary of any bonus will be paid in cash, with any bonus paid in excess of 75% of salary compulsorily deferred into shares for three years, irrespective of whether the applicable shareholding guideline has been met.
Vesting of LTIP awards Core awards granted on 6 July 2011 together with the associated Multiplier awards granted on 6 July 2014 and Core awards granted on 17 July 2013 under the Performance Share Plan will vest in July 2016 based on performance to the year ended 31 March 2016 subject to a decision by the executive directors to roll-over 50% or 100% of the 2013 Core awards.
The performance conditions and estimated vesting outcomes for these awards are as follows: BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Directors Remuneration report continued 2011 LTIP Core and Multiplier included in single figure for total remuneration The Core awards granted in July 2011 were subject to 50% cumulative trading profit and 50% TSR targets over the three years to 31 March 2014.
All that time, full vesting was achieved on both elements due to performance of 173.4m trading profit compared to a stretch target of 101.7m, and TSR performance of 164.2% compared to an upper quartile target of 96.4%.
Vesting of all Core awards were deferred and put at risk in 2014 and in return each director was eligible to receive Multiplier awards, with both elements capable of vesting in July 2016, subject to TSR performance over the five years to 31 March 2016.

If Core awards are deferred in July 2016, each director will have the Core awards plus the associated Multiplier awards Louise Makin 417,614 awards and Rolf Soderstrom 273,728 awards subject to a five-year TSR condition.
BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The 2013 performance share awards are subject to the multiplier mechanism approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
As a result the number of shares that are capable of vesting under the 2013 PSP this year as a Core award are subject to an election by either executive director to forego vesting of 50% or 100% of that award and roll-over the award in return for the entitlement to receive a Multiplier award which may increase or decrease the number of shares vesting at year five based on relative TSR performance up to the end of that period.
This election must be made before the shares vest in July 2016.
The Core awards will not vest until the expiry of the period within which directors are able to elect to roll-over their awards without a valid election having been made.
Any Multiplier award will not vest until the period of five years from grant of the original Core award.

50% of the 2015 award comprises a Core award and the remaining 50% comprises a Multiplier award that can only be received if the executive director puts at risk their Core award for a further two years after vesting.
25% of the Core award i. e. 12.5% of the total award vests at threshold.
These awards have been attached to the 2012 Core award that would otherwise have vested in June 2015.
This gives effect to the Multiplier mechanism approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM, which provides executive directors with an opportunity to place their 2012 Core awards at risk in return for a matching Multiplier award.
Depending on performance against the Multiplier performance condition the Core award could be reduced, potentially to zero.
The number of awards under the 2015 Core award that will vest will be determined according to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions each performance condition applies to 50% of a Core award Relative TSR ranking against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index Percentage of vesting of Adjusted EPS in the financial year as at 1 April 2015 for the period that portion of an award to 31 March 2018 from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2018 50% of the Core award 50% of the Core award 0% 23.0p below threshold Below median 25% 23.0p threshold Median 100% 30.3p stretch Upper quartile Vesting on a straight line basis in between threshold and stretch EPS or median and upper quartile TSR.
If a participant elects to roll-over 50% or 100% of their vested Core awards, participants will receive matching Multiplier awards on a one-for-one basis which, together with the vested deferred Core awards, will be subject to a further performance condition.
Under the Multiplier performance condition, for each 1% of TSR underperformance of the median TSR, the shares that vest under the deferred Core award will decrease by 1%, for each 1% of TSR outperformance of the median TSR, the shares that vest under the Multiplier award will increase by 1%.

2 In 2015, Louise elected to receive a Multiplier award as an alternative to the vesting of the 2012 PSP as a Core award and on 1 June 2015 a Multiplier award of 186,063 was granted.
3 Performance shares awarded in 2013 were subject to an EPS and a relative TSR condition against the FTSE 250 both of equal weighting.
The EPS condition required a threshold performance of 17.7p and stretch performance of 24.1p.
The relative TSR target required a threshold performance of a median position and a stretch performance of finishing at or above upper quartile with straight line vesting in between these points.
Footnote Unless otherwise stated the Groups TSR will be compared with that of a peer group comprising FTSE 250 companies.
2 In 2015, Rolf elected to receive a Multiplier award as an alternative to the vesting of the 2012 PSP as a Core award and on 1 June 2015 a Multiplier award of 137,961 was granted.
Share options and performance shares were granted for nil consideration.
The price used for calculating the number of shares awarded under the PSP and DSBP was based on the average of the closing share prices over the five days immediately prior to the award date.
Share options are awarded using the closing mid-market price on the date before grant.
Sharesave options were granted on the condition that participants agreed to enter into a monthly savings contract.
Awards other than DSBP awards are normally satisfied using new issue shares.
The Groups share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution limits and the Group has always operated within these limits.
Assuming none of the extant options lapse and will be exercised and, having included all exercised options, the Group has utilised 3.5% of the 10% in ten years and 3.0% of the 5% in ten years in accordance with the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance on dilution limits.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
BTG FTSE 250 The Group has chosen the Index as a comparator as it believes that it gives shareholders a reasonable comparison with the TSR of other equity investments in companies of a broadly similar size across all sectors.
The TSR performance has been measured by NBS.
The middle market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2016 was 621.5p.
During the year the share price ranged from a low of 520.5p to a high of 787.5p.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and LTIP awards which vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus and LTIP percentages show the payout for each year as a percentage of the maximum.
