The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, risk or regulatory compliance issues and also in the event that the level of bonus represents, in the Committees view, an excessive proportion of the Groups overall profitability.
There were no events in 2016 which led the Committee to determine that a scale back of the annual bonus payment was appropriate.
In addition, the Committee did not consider that the level of bonus represented an excessive proportion of the Groups overall profitability such that it should be scaled back.
Awards in 2016 were subject to deferral arrangements in line with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
30% of awards will be deferred into shares, with the deferred portion vesting in equal thirds over three years.

The Committee now considers these targets no longer to be sensitive and, as such, they have been set out below.
The annual bonus for 2015 was based 75% on a financial measure and 25% on personal and customer measures.
The financial measure was assessed on the Groups trading profit with reference to a sliding scale.
Actual trading profit was 92.3m, which was between target and maximum performance and represented a solid set of financial results given market conditions.
The Committee selected the targets for the 2015 annual bonus awards based on budgeted levels of profit given the context of the external environment as well as esures own strategic plans for the 2015 financial year.
The Committee is satisfied that the targets were sufficiently stretching for the Executive Directors and were appropriate in driving the continued success of the esure business following the completion of the Gocompare.
The outcome against the financial objectives during 2015 is set out below: Threshold Target Maximum Actual Profit m 73.0 91.3 109.6 92.3 Vesting 25% 50% 100% 52.73% The table below details the overall payouts to Executive Directors in respect of the 2015 annual bonus.
This was provided in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report and is reproduced here to show the outcomes of performance against the financial target in relation to the overall bonus awards for the year: Therefore, the overall outcome for 2015 awards is set out below: Actual % of maximum achieved Actual % of salary achieved Executive Financial Non-financial Overall Financial Non-financial Overall Total award Stuart Vann 52.73% 92% 62.55% 29.66% 17.25% 46.91% 236,738 Darren Ogden 52.73% 88% 61.54% 19.77% 11% 30.77% 104,810 Vesting of long-term incentive awards for performance periods ending during the year ending 31 December 2016 audited Executive Directors were granted awards under the 2014 PSP, the vesting of which was due to be determined with reference to the performance period ending on 31 December 2016.
Following the Demerger of the Gocompare.
com business, the Committee used its discretion to determine that the 2014 awards should vest early upon completion of the Demerger on 3 November 2016.
Under the PSP, Executive Directors have agreed to retain any shares net of tax for a six-month period post-vesting.
Performance was assessed on a pro-rata basis for the period from 1 January 2014 to 30 September 2016.
Awards were subject to EPS performance two-thirds and relative TSR performance one-third with performance originally due to be measured over a three-year period.
EPS was measured on a straight-line basis between a threshold growth target of 15% and a stretch target of 39%.
The Groups TSR was ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250, excluding investment trusts and esure.
25% of the TSR element of the award vests for median performance rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile ranking or above.
EPS growth targets 2014 Awards Threshold 25% vesting 15% Stretch 100% vesting 39% EPS performance was below 15% growth which was below threshold for the shorter performance period, resulting in nil vesting under the EPS element of the award.
Relative TSR performance was between the median and upper quartile of the peer group, resulting in 75.3% vesting of the TSR portion.
Therefore the 2014 awards achieved an overall vesting outcome of 25.1% of the maximum award available.

No further awards will be granted under the Performance Share Plan, as new awards will now be issued under the SLP.
Treatment of outstanding long-term incentive awards following the Demerger of Gocompare.
com 2015 PSP awards PSP awards granted in 2015 are subject to the same performance conditions and targets as the 2014 awards.
In the context of the Demerger, the Committee determined that an adjustment to the measurement of EPS performance was necessary to enable continued measurement of performance on a like-for-like basis.
Therefore, the Committee used its discretion to determine that the 2015 EPS condition will be measured by excluding the impact of Gocompare.
com from the base year EPS i. e. comparing base year EPS for esure Group only with the final year EPS for esure Group at the end of the performance period.
The growth targets themselves remain unchanged.
The table provides the target growth at threshold and maximum for 2014 and 2015.
EPS targets rise from threshold to maximum and vesting in between is on a straight-line basis.
EPS is measured over a three-year period taking as a starting figure the 2014 EPS.
Earnings per share growth targets 2015 awards Threshold 25% vesting 15% Stretch 100% vesting 39% Relative TSR is measured over the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 for the 2015 awards.
No adjustments have been made to the targets as the companys TSR was rebased at the time of the Demerger.
SLP awards granted in 2016 The SLP awards are subject to an absolute TSR growth target for three-quarters of the award and relative TSR for the remaining one-quarter of the award.
The targets for the 2016 SLP awards were stated in the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report and were based on very stretching plans which reflected the high growth potential of Gocompare.
com for the duration of the performance period.
As a result of the Demerger, the Committee determined that the original absolute TSR targets for the 2016 SLP awards would be significantly harder to achieve due to the less diversified sources of value in the Group, with performance wholly dependent on the level of competition in the motor and home market.
The Committee therefore used discretion to adjust the absolute TSR targets for 2016 SLP awards to ensure that these were equivalently stretching for participants following the Demerger.
The Committee is of the opinion that the revised targets reflect the strategic plan of esure going forward while maintaining an ongoing level of incentivisation.
The targets have been revised to reflect the same level of stretch as the original targets, and are only adjusted to reflect the lower growth projections of the esure business without the impact of Gocompare.
The original and revised targets for the 2016 SLP absolute TSR element are as follows: Maximum exceptional Absolute TSR growth Threshold 15% vesting Mid 35% vesting Good 66% vesting 100% vesting Original targets 13% p. a.
In respect of the relative TSR condition, performance will be measured over the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
As for previous years awards, the Groups TSR will be ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and esure itself at the start of the performance period.
As for 2015 awards, no adjustments will be made to the relative TSR targets as the Companys TSR was rebased at the time of the Demerger.

The Executive Directors and a small number other senior management received share awards under this new plan following the Demerger of Gocompare.
A description of the RAP and the basis for making the awards was provided in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting.
The RAP awards are not subject to any performance conditions but are subject to a holding period.
Awards will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date and will be released in equal thirds on the second, third and fourth anniversary of the grant date.
These awards were outside the limitations of the current Directors Remuneration Policy and as such, special approval was obtained from shareholders.
No further awards will be made under the RAP in future years.

The Company operates within these limits, currently tracking at 2.03% of outstanding capital in all employee share scheme plans and 1.43% in executive plans.
All-employee share plans and other arrangements The Board adopted two all-employee share plans in 2013: the SIP and the Sharesave Plan.
Participation is currently being offered under the Sharesave Plan to employees including the Executive Directors.
Employees can save up to 500 a month increased from 250 in 2013 to purchase shares on the exercise of their Sharesave options at a purchase price of 80% of market value at the date of grant.
