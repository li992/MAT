66 DIRECTORS FUTURE REMUNERATION POLICY The Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors, which Shareholders will be asked to approve at the AGM to be held on 27 April 2017 and which will apply to payments made from this date is set out below.
Until this time the Policy approved by Shareholders on 16 April 2014 will continue to apply.
Our current Remuneration Policy was approved by our shareholders in April 2014 with over 90% of the votes in favour.
The changes proposed to the policy reflect the expiration, for the purposes of new awards, of the 2012 LTIP and the associated need to ensure that the policy is appropriate for the next three years.
In summary the changes made to the proposed policy as compared to the policy approved at the 2014 AGM are as follows: A key element of our remuneration framework is the 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2012 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders in 2012.
As no more awards will be granted to Executive Directors under the 2012 LTIP, it is not included in our forward looking Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Executive Directors existing entitlements under the 2012 LTIP set out on page 80 will continue in accordance with their terms.
As set out in the Chairmans Statement we have included a new plan the 2017 Performance Share Plan 2017 PSP, which would apply to new Executive Directors appointed if any after the date the policy is adopted, and to existing Executive Directors once their 2012 LTIP awards have vested in full.
Minor amendments have been made to the policy to aid its administration.
A summary of the Companys policy on Directors remuneration, broken down by Executive Directors, Chairman and Non-Executive Directors is set out in the tables below.
Executive Directors The Committees policy for the Executive Directors is to provide remuneration which is largely performance orientated, closely aligns the Directors interests with those of shareholders and which will retain a talented executive team who can deliver excellent long term Company performance.
To achieve the aim of this policy the remuneration of the Executive Directors is made up of different elements of fixed and variable pay, with a significant emphasis on performance related pay for achievement of stretching targets.
If challenging performance conditions attached to variable pay are achieved in full, a substantial proportion of an Executive Directors remuneration will be performance related.
Overall, the Committees policy is to ensure that the balance of performance conditions provides a good link to the Companys business strategy and continues to make the Company successful on a sustainable basis.

An additional payment in the form of cash or shares may be made to reflect the value of dividends which would have been paid on vested shares over such period as the Committee determines, ending no later than the date on which the award is released.
Awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions which enable the Committee to cancel or reduce an unvested award or require repayment of a vested award for up to two years following the end of the performance period which is effected through the cancellation or reduction of the award if it remains subject to a holding period.
These provisions may be applied in the event of material misstatement of financial results, gross misconduct which substantially affects the Companys financial performance or reputation and error in the assessment of an awards performance condition.
The Committee retains discretion to operate the 2017 PSP In accordance with its rules, including the ability to adjust the terms of any award to take account of any variation of the Companys share capital or any demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event that may affect the Companys shareprice.

Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 70 Directors future remuneration policy continued 2012 LTIP The Committee considers that it is appropriate for a significant component of an Executive Directors remuneration to be share-based with long term performance conditions closely linked to the Companys long term strategy.
To align the interests of the Executive Directors with the Companys long term financial performance and with the interests of shareholders the Companys long term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors is the 2012 LTIP.
Options granted under the 2012 LTIP have a performance condition directly linked to the return of 1.9bn 6.20 per share to shareholders over the Capital Return Plan period and a vesting period over the same timescale.
The initial exercise price will reduce by the value of cash returns to shareholders during the period from date of grant to the earlier of 31 December 2021 or the date of exercise of an option.
There is an underpin requirement in the 2012 LTIP that the cash returns paid by the Company are financed out of retained earnings and the Company has an ungeared balance sheet at the relevant performance measurement date.
Subject to performance, up to 40% of options may be exercisable at 31 December 2017.
The balance of options may be exercisable on the earlier of 31 December 2021 and the date the performance condition is achieved in full.
After sales to meet tax, no more than 50% of shares received upon exercise of an option may be sold within 12 months of the date of exercise.
The Committee may waive this condition for good leavers and in exceptional circumstances.
A clawback arrangement under the Companys long term incentive plans allows the Company to recover share awards which have vested as a result of an error or misstatement, or if a Director is guilty of gross misconduct which substantially affects the Companys financial performance or reputation.
No further options will be granted under the 2012 LTIP to Executive Directors.
However, the existing options will continue and, subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions, may be exercised in accordance with their terms.
The options held by the Executive Directors are set out on page 80.
Choice of performance conditions Annual bonus conditions Rationale for selection and how performance targets are set Profit before tax and cash Aligned with the Companys strategy to deliver high quality growth and return cash to shareholders.
These are important generation factors in ensuring overall business performance, sustainability and reputation.
Customer satisfaction and health Annual bonus performance conditions are reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that they take into consideration and safety the Companys strategy and the outlook for the Company over the medium term and are appropriate from a risk perspective.
The Committee retains the right to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions, which cause the Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that theyachieve their original purpose.
2017 PSP The Committees approach Awards under the 2017 PSP will only be granted to: 1 Executive Directors appointed after the 2017 Annual General Meeting: and 2 Executive Directors appointed before the 2017 AGM when their awards under the 2012 LTIP have vested.
Since it is not, therefore, currently proposed to grant awards to Executive Directors under the 2017 PSP, the details of any measures have not been considered.
The Committee would consult with shareholders as appropriate in relation to the applicable performance measures in advance of any award under the 2017 PSP being granted to an Executive Director.
For initial awards to senior managers under the 2017 PSP, the intention is to align the performance targets with the CapitalReturn Plan.
This is aligned with our strategy and provides consistency with the participants in the current 2012 LTIP.
Differences between the Executive Directors and general employees remuneration policy Performance related pay makes up a significantly higher proportion of remuneration for the Executive Directors and senior employees than for employees generally, reflecting the role of these individuals in managing the business to achieve the Companys strategic objectives.
The Committee considers that the emphasis on performance related pay for Executive Directors and senior employees closelyaligns the Directors interests with those of shareholders and helps to deliver excellent long term Company performance.

Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 72 Directors future remuneration policy continued Recruitment and promotion policy The Companys policy is to promote internally where possible.
The Committees approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates with the appropriate skills for the housebuilding industry.
The Committee retains discretion to include other elements of remuneration which are not included in the policy set out above should business needs require.
However, this discretion is subject to the following principles and limitations, and the commercial rationale for taking such action will be disclosed inthe following Annual Report on Remuneration.
The salary for a new Executive Director may be set below the normal market rate, with phased increases over the first few years as theDirector gains experience in their new role.
Pension salary supplement benefits will be provided in line with the policy set out above.
The variable remuneration that may be awarded will be subject to the limit set out below.
The discretion will not be used to make non-performance related incentive payments for example a golden hello.
The Committee may alter the performance measures and vesting period of annual bonus awards to take account of the circumstances of the recruitment and if the Executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance, the quantum in respect of the months employed during that year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and proportionate basis.
The Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements at recruitment when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would take account of the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted to a new Executive Director on appointment excluding any award to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer will be 450% of salary and, for a new Chief Executive, 500% of salary.
As described in the policy tables above, it may also be necessary to offer relocation benefits for external and internal appointments.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive Director would be in line with the structure set out in the policy table for Non-Executive Directors.
Service contracts The Companys policy is for service contracts with Executive Directors to have no more than a 12-month notice period.
The Committee reserves the discretion to offer a longer notice period initially to an Executive Director recruited externally.
In such cases where a longer notice period is given, the Executive Directors notice period would be reduced to 12 months once the initial period has lapsed.
The Executive Directors have a contract with a twelve month notice period.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not employees, they have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities: they do not have service contracts.
The Chairmans letter of appointment is dated 7 March 2011 but is effective from his appointment as Chairman on 21 April 2011.
The Chairmans continued appointment is subject to his re-election by shareholders at each AGM and may be terminated on six monthsnotice.
The Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment are effective from their date of appointment.
A Non-Executives appointment is initially for a three-year term but is subject to re-election at each AGM but their appointment may be terminated on onemonths notice.
There are no change of control provisions in the Executive Directors service contracts.
The rules of the Companys share schemes provide for early exercise of awards on a takeover or change of control.
Policy on payment for loss of office The Company retains the right to terminate each Executive Directors service agreement by making a payment in lieu of some or all of thenotice period.
Save as noted below in relation to Mike Killoran, any such payment would consist of base salary and benefits including pension or salary supplement contributions in respect of the unexpired notice period for termination.
Such payments will be subject to mitigation by the Director.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 73 Save as noted below in relation to Mike Killoran, any payment to an Executive Director on termination in respect of annual bonus will be determined by the Committee taking into account the circumstances of the termination.
Any payment will be pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the bonus year worked and subject to performance achieved.
Payments will ordinarily only be made at the usual time although the Committee retains discretion to make payments early in appropriate circumstances.
The Committee retains discretion to pay the whole of the bonus for the year of departure and or the previous year in cash.
Under his service agreement entered into in 2002, if Mike Killoran leaves as a Good Leaver as defined in the agreement, his termination payment will include any payment for bonus to which he would have been entitled had he remained in employment to the end of the notice period subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition.
In other circumstances, Mr Killoran will be entitled to payment in respect of any bonus awarded but not paid and to a pro-rated bonus for the year of departure subject to satisfaction of the performance condition.
Options under the 2012 LTIP, Bonus Share Scheme awards and SAYE options are not contractual entitlements and Directors awards will lapse under the rules of those schemes on termination of employment save in standard good leaver circumstances.
In good leaver circumstances 2012 LTIP Awards would continue to be subject to the original performance conditions but the number of shares under award would be scaled back pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
The Committee has the discretion to reduce any scaling back if it considers it inappropriate in a particular case.
Bonus Share Scheme awards and SAYE options would be exercisable within six months of an Executive Director leaving the Company under the standard good leaver circumstances.
If an Executive Director participates in the 2017 PSP and ceases employment, the rules of the 2017 PSP will govern the treatment of his award.
In the event of cessation during the performance period, an award will ordinarily lapse.
However, in good leaver circumstances including cessation due to death, ill-health, injury, disability or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee awards may be retained.
Retained awards will ordinarily vest and be released on the originally anticipated timescale subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions and a reduction to reflect the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed although the Committee has discretion to vest and release the awards earlier, and to assess the performance conditions accordingly, and not to apply the time based reduction.
In the event of cessation during the holding period, the award may be retained other than in the case of summary dismissal and will be released at the ordinary release date to the extent the performance condition was met although the Committee hasdiscretion to release the awards earlier.
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with an Executive Directors cessation of office or employment where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach ofsuch an obligation or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of a Directors office or employment.
Any such payments may include but are not limited to paying any fees for outplacement assistance and or the Directors legal and or professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of office or employment.
Legacy arrangements The Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payment or payment for loss of office including exercising any discretion available to it in respect of any such payment outside the policy in this report: where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect including the satisfaction of options granted under the 2012 LTIP, provided in the case of any payment whose terms were agreed after the previous Directors Remuneration Policy was approved at the Companys 2014 AGM and before the policy in this report became effective, the remuneration payment or payment forloss of office was permitted under that former policy: and where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes, payment includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, theterms of the payment are agreed no later than the time the award is granted.
External appointments None of the Executive Directors currently have an external appointment.
The Directors recognise that external appointments can broaden an individuals skills and experience.
If an Executive Director wishes to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Chairman.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 74 Directors future remuneration policy continued Illustrations of application of remuneration policy The charts below illustrate the value of remuneration each of the Executive Directors could receive for 2017 under three scenarios being the minimum remuneration they will receive: the remuneration in line with expected performance, and the maximum achievable.
Fixed pay is base salary for 2017, plus benefits and pension salary supplements.
Annual variable pay is the annual bonus receivable.
Expected performance would deliver 67% of the maximum annual bonus.
The Committee will not make long term incentive plan awards to the existing Executive Directors in 2017 and so no allowance has been made for long term variable remuneration in the illustrations below.
Awards have previously been made to Executive Directors under the 2012 LTIP but these have a performance condition linked to the return to shareholders of 6.20 per share over the period from2012, with the first opportunity for exercise up to a maximum of 40% of the vested shares on 31 December 2017.

Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 75 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committees Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2016 is set out below, including remuneration for 2016 and the proposed implementation of the updated Remuneration Policy for 2017.
The auditor is required to report on the following information up to and including the Statement of Directors shareholding requirements and share interests.
As a result the actual salary paid to an Executive Director while accruing service in this scheme was reduced by 9% of pensionable salary, which would have been the member rate of contribution to the scheme.
Jeff Fairburn accrued benefits in the defined benefit pension scheme until 31 March 2016 when his membership of the scheme ceased.
Dave Jenkinson remains a member of the scheme.
# Nigel Greenaway retired from the Board on 14 April 2016 and from the Group on 30 April 2016.
Figures above are the amounts earned to 14 April 2016.
Information in relation to payments made to Mr Greenaway following his retirement from the Board is included on page 79.
2016 figures are from 4 April 2016, the date when Nigel Mills was appointed to the Board.
2016 figures are to 14 April 2016, the date when Richard Pennycook and Mark Preston retired from the Board.
Mark Prestons fees were paid in full to his employing company, Grosvenor Estate Holdings.
During the year no Director waived their entitlement to any emoluments.
Additional information on the amounts which make up the single figure for total remuneration is set out below.
Benefits Benefits include fully financed cars or cash car allowance, private medical scheme membership, life assurance benefits, income protection scheme membership, professional subscriptions and some telephone costs.
Annual bonus 2016 The performance condition for Executive Directors 2016 annual bonus excluding Nigel Greenaways bonus, details of which are set out later in this section was made up of two financial metrics, being profit and cash generation measures up to 50% and 40% of maximum bonus potential, respectively, and also included two non-financial metrics, being a customer care measure up to 10% of maximum bonus, but subject to a potential downward modifier based on customer care performance and a health and safety measure which couldact as a downward modifier of up to 10% of bonus.
The profit performance condition for 2016 annual bonuses was the achievement of Group profit before tax before exceptionals and goodwill impairment for the year the profit measure.
The cash generation performance condition was the Group net cash inflow beforeCapital Return Plan and net land payments for the year the cash generation measure.
The customer care condition was split into three equal measures.
One third of the measure was to achieve a minimum percentage of customers who would recommend Persimmon, as measured by the results of the NHBCs Customer Satisfaction Survey question, Would you recommend Persimmon to a friend?
This survey is an independent measure of customer satisfaction for houses legally completed from October 2015 to September 2016, measured from survey responses published up to 10 February 2017.
The second Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 76 Annual report on remuneration continued measure was based on achievement of Group Customer Journey Performance documents issued on time, as measured through the Persimmon Group reporting process.
The final measure was meeting legal completion of house sales within 30 days of target, as set out by the Persimmon Group reporting process.
However, if the Group was rated as a two star builder with a score of less than 70% asmeasured by the NHBC Customer Satisfaction Survey as at 31 January 2017, then there would be no customer care bonus element payable, even if some of the other targets were met.
The health and safety performance condition could reduce the total annual bonus payments if any to the Executive Directors by up to 10% if in the view of the Committee, the health and safety management and or performance of the Group is below the standard expected of a reputable market-leading housebuilder.
The Committee reviewed the Groups health and safety performance and agreed not to reduce the Executive Directors annual bonuses for 2016.
The target figures set for each part of the performance condition, and the extent to which they were achieved are set out below.

The Remuneration Committee has agreed that Nigels performance was satisfactory and the full bonus will be paid.

The bonus share awards earned under the annual bonus arrangements for 2016 were calculated at the average share price of 19.459 over the period from 1 January 2017 to 14 February 2017, inclusive.
These awards will ordinarily vest half on the announcement of the annual results in 2018 and half on the announcement of the annual results in 2019.
Vesting of Bonus Share Scheme awards is not subject to further performance conditions, other than the Director must remain employed at the date of exercise subject to standard goodleaver provisions.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 77 Long Term Incentive Plan awards vesting in 2016 Jeff Fairburn, Mike Killoran and Dave Jenkinson have outstanding awards under the 2012 LTIP, which have a 10 year performance period.
The first and second targets have been achieved, which is to return 1.70 and 2.80 per share to shareholders by 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2017 respectively.
However vesting will not take placed until 31 December 2017.
Nigel Greenaway retired from the Group on 30 April 2016 after almost 30 years service and as a good leaver his 2012 LTIP awards vested on 1 May 2016.
The number of shares available under his awards was reduced on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the 2012 LTIP rules.
The performance condition attached to the awards was the achievement of Capital Return Plan payments to shareholders forfurther information on the performance condition see page 78.
By the date of Nigels retirement 3.50 of the 6.20 Capital Return Plan payments due under the performance condition had been achieved.
As a result, Nigel was able to acquire 667,420 shares at an option price of 2.70 and 39,325 shares at an option price of 7.59.
The share price on the date of vesting was 19.87 making the value of the awards on that date 11,942,512.
Nigel is required to retain half of any shares remaining after sales to pay tax for a minimum of oneyear from date of exercise.
Directors pension entitlements The value of the pension benefits earned and salary supplements paid during the year is as follows.
Value of defined benefit pension Salary earned supplement Total Executive Director # J Fairburn 12,650 148,380 161,030 D Jenkinson 24,144 104,286 128,430 M H Killoran n a 149,061 149,061 N P Greenaway n a 9,079 9,079 # Jeff Fairburn left the defined benefit pension scheme on 31 March 2016.
Nigel Greenaway retired as a Director on 14 April 2016.
Dave Jenkinson is a member of the Companys defined benefit pension scheme and Jeff Fairburn was a member until 31 March 2016, when he elected to cease accrual due to HMRC tax allowance limits.
Benefits are earned on a career average revalued earnings basis at an accrual rate of sixtieths.
They each have a normal retirement age in the scheme of 65.
Both Dave Jenkinson and Jeff Fairburn earned pension on a scheme capped salary of 149,400 until 31 March 2016.
Dave Jenkinsons pensionable salary was amended to 37,500 from 1 April 2016, to align his pension accrual with his pension Annual Allowance for tax purposes.
In addition, each received a salary supplement of 24% of the difference between their pensionable salaries and their base salaries.
After ceasing membership of the scheme on 31 March 2016 Jeff Fairburns salary supplement was payable on his full base salary.
Mike Killoran has ceased membership of the Company pension schemes, as had Nigel Greenaway.
Both previously earned benefits in the Companys defined benefit pension scheme.
Mike Killorans scheme retirement age is 60 and Nigel Greenaways is 65.
Mike Killoran is paid a salary supplement of 30% of his base salary, which the Committee after taking advice considers is cost neutral to the Company based on the pension benefits Mike Killoran previously earned.
Prior to his retirement, Nigel Greenaway received a salary supplement of 9% of his base salary.
No additional benefits are receivable by the Directors on early retirement.
The defined benefit pension benefits accrued for each Director serving through the year are as set out below: Accrued Accrued Increase in pension as at pension as at Increase in accrued pension 31 December 31 December accrued during the year 2016 2015 pension net of inflation J Fairburn 54,436 53,804 632 632 D Jenkinson 43,682 42,475 1,207 1,207 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 78 Annual report on remuneration continued LTIP awards granted in 2016 Dave Jenkinson was promoted from North Division Chief Executive to Group Managing Director on 7 January 2016 and consequently assumed responsibilities for all Group operating businesses across the country.
Due to the substantially increased nature of Daves responsibilities the Committee agreed that Daves promotion merited an additional award of an option under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2012 2012 LTIP.
Dave was therefore granted the following option in 2016, to bring his total award to the maximum approved by shareholders for the Group Managing Director.
Percentage receivable if Basis on Number of Initial option Fair value Fair value per Regulatory minimum Type of interest which award ordinary exercise at date of year to date of value of performance Performance Name awarded was made shares price the award full vesting the Award achieved period end date Market value Specified number Dave 745,800 21.02 1,543,806 385,952 14,871,252 27% 31 December share option of shares on Jenkinson 2021 promotion to Group Managing Director The fair value of the award is considered by the Committee to be 2.07 per share.
This is the independent calculation of the fair value of the awards for such transactions in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and has been prepared using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
The awards were granted with an option price at full market value and the value will be dependent upon the performance condition being met.
The regulatory value is required to be included using a strict calculation which is inappropriate for this award.
It should be noted that the regulatory value has been calculated using the share price on the date of grant, it takes no account of the fact the award was a market value option and makes no allowance for the exercise price that will be payable by the Director.
The date of grant was 7 March 2016 and the share price on that date was 19.94, however, in accordance with the rules of the 2012 LTIP the market value for setting the initial option exercise price was the average of the mid-market price of a share on the five days prior to the date of grant.
The number of shares that will vest is the same for all awards made under the 2012 LTIP and is dependent on the payment of cash returns to shareholders for the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2021, which must be achieved by the Measurement Dates set out below.
Cumulative Cash Return targets Measurement Dates Achieved 1.70 per share or more by 31 December 2015 2.80 per share or more by 31 December 2017 3.90 per share or more by 31 December 2019 5.05 per share or more by 31 December 2020 6.20 per share or more by 31 December 2021 The initial exercise price will reduce by an amount equal to the value of cash returns to shareholders made by the Company during the period from date of grant to the earlier of 31 December 2021 or the date of exercise of an option.
The aggregate number of shares held under an option that will vest by each Measurement Date will normally be determined by reference to the fraction x 6.20, where x is the value of the Cumulative Cash Return paid by the relevant Measurement Date.
The first and second stages of the performance condition have been achieved but no awards will ordinarily vest until 31 December 2017, at which point up to 40% of the total number of shares held under an option will vest and may be exercised.
The remainder of the award will vest upon completion of the original Capital Return Plan to pay 6.20 per share.
In considering the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied, no options shall vest and become exercisable unless, in the opinion of the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, the cash returns paid by the Company are financed out of retained earnings and the Company has an ungeared balance sheet at the relevant Measurement Date, except to take account of events and or circumstances which the Committee fairly and reasonably determines are appropriate the Underpin.
If the Cumulative Cash Return is not achieved by a future Measurement Date options will vest and become exercisable on the Measurement Date by which the Cash Return for that date has not been achieved and the number of shares that vest will be reduced accordingly.
Once an option vests and becomes exercisable, a participant will be able to sell sufficient shares to pay the tax and national insurance payable but will be required to retain half of the balance of their shares for at least 12 months from date of exercise.

Executive Directors are expected to hold shares in the Company worth 200% of base salary and must retain any vested share awards net of tax until the share ownership requirement is met.
Jeff Fairburn and Mike Killoran hold shares above the minimum share ownership requirement, as did Nigel Greenaway prior to his retirement.
Dave Jenkinson as the most recently appointed Executive Director is yet to meet the shareholding requirement.

Group Chief Executive change in remuneration Set out below is a comparison of the change in remuneration of the Group Chief Executive from 2015 to 2016, compared to the change in remuneration of the Groups salaried employees.
We have selected the salaried workforce as the comparator group as this includes 2,809 2015: 2,729 junior to senior employees with the most relevant pay structure.
Percentage change from 2015 to 2016 Value of taxable Annual salary Bonus benefits Group Chief Executive 3.0% 3.0% 3.4% Average of salaried employees 2.72% -2.99% 13.8% The average bonus per salaried employee fell over the year due to the dilution effect of the increased number of more junior employees and trainees, recruited to support the growth of the business.
These employees generally receive a lower percentage bonus than managers and directors.
Salaried employees generally received a 3% pay increase in 2016.
The average per capita salary increase was lower in 2016, again due to the dilution effect of the increased number of more junior employees and trainees.

Although we are seeking shareholder approval for a new Long Term Incentive Plan, no current Executive Directors will participate in that plan until awards under the 2012 LTIP have fully vested.
The implementation of the new policy in 2017 will be consistent with the implementation of the current policy in 2016, and a summary of the approach is set out below.
Executive Directors Base salaries After taking into consideration Group employees salary increases in 2016 salaried employees generally received a 3% base salary increase in 2016 together with general market conditions, the Committee has awarded salary increases of 3% to the Executive Directors.
Base salary from 1 January 2017 2016 Jeff Fairburn 675,270 655,600 Dave Jenkinson 515,000 500,000 Mike Killoran 511,775 496,870 Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2016 84 Annual report on remuneration continued Annual bonus In line with the Companys strategy to improve margins and return cash to shareholders under the Capital Return Plan, the Committee has decided that the most appropriate performance condition for 2017 annual bonus will again primarily be based on profit before tax and cash generation measures, plus conditions relating to customer satisfaction, which will account for 10% of the maximum bonus opportunity but subject to a potential downward modifier based on customer care performance.
Health and safety outcomes may act as a downward modifier of up to 10% of the bonus outcome.
The Committee considers that the chosen annual bonus performance targets and maximum award levels achieve their aim of having a large part of an Executive Directors remuneration performance related and that those performance conditions are closely aligned to the Companys strategy to grow the business, improve margins and increase cashflow.
They also link the Executive Directors remuneration with two of the Companys key non-financial performance indicators.
The targets are based on figures which are commercially sensitive, but they will be disclosed in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee considers that the targets it has set are stretching.
Annual bonus awards continue to be subject to robust clawback and malus provisions.
The Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus potential for Jeff Fairburn should remain at 200% of base salary.
This structure enhances the emphasis on pay for performance, with any annual bonus payable in excess of 100% of base salary paid entirely in deferred shares.
The Committee has retained the maximum annual bonus achievable for the other Executive Directors at 150% of base salary.
Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary would again be paid in bonus share scheme awards for all Executive Directors.
Ordinarily half will vest one year and the other half will vest two years after the announcement of the relevant years financial results.
Long Term Incentive Plan awards As set out in the updated policy, the Committee will not grant further awards to Jeff Fairburn, Mike Killoran or Dave Jenkinson until the 2012 LTIP awards have vested.
Pension and Pension Salary Supplement There is no change to pension benefits for 2017: current arrangements are as set out on page 77.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees The Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee for 2016 should be increased by 3%, making his fee for 2017 213,880.
In addition, the Committee agreed that the Chairman should receive a car allowance of 23,000 p. a. from November 2016.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors.
The Board has agreed that the fee for 2017 should increase by approximately 3%, making the fee 60,000, plus the additional fee for the extra responsibilities in chairing a committee has increased from 10,000 to 15,000.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the Chairmans and each Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee is currently comprised of the following four Non-Executive Directors, who all served throughout the year except Nigel Mills who was appointed to the Committee on 4 April 2016 and Mark Preston who resigned from the Committee on 14 April 2016 when he resigned from the Board.

Deloitte was selected by the Committee due to their expertise in executive remuneration.
The Committee considers that the advice provided by Deloitte as professional remuneration consultants is objective and independent.
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to its Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Deloitte have no other connection with the Company.
The amount of fees the Company paid to New Bridge Street and Deloitte for the services they provided in 2016 was 690 and 19,646 respectively, charged on a time spent basis.
In addition, the Committee consulted with Jeff Fairburn, Group Chief Executive, but no Director was involved in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee has also reviewed the remuneration of the Groups Regional Boards the level of management below Board level.
