Governance Directors remuneration report Context and business performance Annual statement from the Chairman This has been a year of excellent performance across all of our markets.
The UK and Ireland has delivered another year of significant growth, exceeding revenue of 8 billion and 40 million products for the first time.
Dear Shareholder We closed the year in Germany with our first ever full year profit and On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present in Italy we grew our customer base to its highest level in three years.

Base salaries for the Group CEO and Group COO & CFO were increased There are four key drivers of performance that underpin the sustainability by 2.5% on 1 July 2016.
This compares to increases of between 2% and success of our business, and these have been reflected in performance and 10% for our employees based on performance targets for our bonus and Long Term Incentive Plans: Annual bonus payments made in full at 200% of base salary for the Revenue growth: The key measure of how the Group is delivering CEO and 150% for the Group COO & CFO on its overall strategy Matching shares under the 2013 co-investment plan vested in full, Paid-for products growth: Shows progress against our multi-product with like for like earnings growth of 28% over three years strategy As mentioned in my annual statement for 2015, measurement of the Adjusted operating profit: Focuses on our ability to manage costs performance outcome for the 2013 co-investment plan has been restated and productivity for the UK and Ireland only to avoid the distortive effect of the acquisition Adjusted operating cash flow: Ensuring that profit is successfully of Sky in Germany and Sky in Italy in November 2014. converted into cash able to be distributed or reinvested Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are made annually but vest We also measure Earnings Per Share growth and relative TSR as only every two years.

Annual Report 2016 49 Directors remuneration report Annual statement from the Chairman continued Decisions made during the year Last year for the first time we made retrospective disclosure of the targets for the annual bonus and LTIP vesting.
The Committee discussed its position again this year and we remain of the firm view that the early disclosure of specific targets continues to be commercially sensitive.
We operate in a highly competitive market both in acquiring customers and in particular for bidding for key rights in competition with a very small number of large and well-resourced competitors.
We believe strongly that early disclosure of targets would provide a material insight on forthcoming operating plans to our competitors and therefore would be to the detriment of our shareholders.
A number of our direct competitors either do not disclose their targets or they are subsumed into a much larger Group target.
Our commitment remains to make retrospective disclosure when the targets are no longer commercially sensitive.
We anticipate this to be two years after the end of the performance period.
As a result we have disclosed the targets for the 2014 annual bonus on page 60.
There was no LTIP vesting in 2014.
I also made a commitment last year that the Committee would review its position on clawback.
We have done this and decided to introduce a clawback provision for the annual bonus, Co-Investment and Long Term Incentive Plans in cases of gross misconduct and for misstatement of results.
This will apply to share awards granted from July 2016 as well as bonus awards for the next performance year.
As the business has made significant progress against our strategy for growth the Remuneration Committee agreed it was the right time to review the performance measures for the bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan to ensure continued alignment to our key drivers of performance.
The Committee decided to replace paid-for products growth with revenue growth, which we believe is now a more relevant indicator of success against our broader growth strategy.
Revenue growth captures AdSmart, thirdparty distribution revenue and Sky Store, none of which are captured in the narrower measure of product growth.
Activity in the coming year We regularly monitor our policy to ensure it continues to support the interests of our shareholders and to reward our Executive Directors appropriately.
Whilst this policy has been extremely effective, has commanded high levels of support at our AGMs and has delivered exceptional returns for shareholders, we will undertake a detailed review during the next 12 months and will seek the views of our shareholders prior to submission of a new Remuneration Policy for approval at the 2017 AGM.

This will include vesting of awards made in 2014 and 2015.
Awards made in 2012 and 2013 vested in July 2015.
There is no LTIP vesting in 2016.
What share-based incentive awards did we make in the year?
2 Market price at date of CIP matching award was 10.42 on 28 August 2015.
Performance conditions for the Long Term Incentive Plan Awards made in July 2015 were Year 2 nil-cost awards.
That is, they relate to the three-year performance period beginning on 1 July 2014 and ending on 30 June 2017, and are subject to the following performance conditions: 1.
Operational targets 70% of the award There are three equally weighted operational performance measures, each of which is a key indicator of Skys continued success: EPS growth Operating cash flow Revenue growth The Committee will make retrospective disclosure of the targets for operating cash flow and revenue growth when they are deemed to be no longer commercially sensitive.
This means that we will review disclosure of performance targets in our 2019 implementation report, with a view to publishing unless the Committee believes they are still commercially sensitive in the context of the market in which the company operates.
For EPS, two points are awarded for growth of RPI 3% per year, with the maximum ten points awarded for RPI 5% per year or more.
For operating cash flow and revenue growth, one point is awarded for 75% achievement of target on a sliding scale up to ten points for 105% or more.
One point equates to 10% of the award vesting, with maximum vesting for 21 points or more, vesting on a straight-line basis between these points.
There is no additional award for achievement above 21 points.
If the minimum range is met each year for all measures, 26% of the shares vest.
The Committee sets a high threshold vesting level in line with our policy of rewarding success not failure.
Maximum vesting is not achievable if performance is below threshold for any one measure.
To earn the minimum of one point on any one of these measures requires the achievement of 75% of target.
Missing two targets would represent a significant and disproportionate reduction in total compensation.

This is equivalent to absolute growth in earnings of 26% over three years if RPI is 3% a year.
This level of growth in earnings was set at a level which exceeded consensus research analysts estimates.
Relative TSR performance 30% of the award The Companys TSR performance is measured relative to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 100.
If the Companys TSR performance is below median, the TSR element of the award lapses in full.
For median performance, one-third of the shares subject to the TSR condition may vest, with all the shares vesting for upper quartile performance.

The table below sets out total remuneration received by the Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 and the prior year ended 30 June 2015.
The vesting pattern of awards under the LTIP is biennial: shares vest every other year over a three-year performance period.
This means that every other year no payment is due as there is no vesting of awards.
The following year, assuming performance conditions are met, there will be a payment which covers the equivalent of two years vesting.
2015 was a year in which the LTIPs awarded for the performance period 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2015 vested.
2016 is a non-vesting year, the single figure is therefore lower than 2015.
The average increase for employees at that time was 2.5%, rising to 3.5% for those earning less than 31,000 per year, with a range of 2% to 10% for performance, promotions and market adjustments.
2 Taxable benefits include company car or car allowance and healthcare, and provision of tax advice for Andrew Griffith.
3 Pension comprises a cash allowance in lieu of company contributions.
4 Bonus shows the full amount earned shortly after year end in which the performance measures applied, including amounts deferred through the CIP.
The payout for the 2015 bonus was 200% of base salary for the Group CEO and 150% for the Group COO & CFO.
The figures for 2016 are 200% for the Group CEO and 150% for the Group COO & CFO.
The Executive Directors deferred 50% of their bonus into shares through the CIP in 2015 and it is anticipated they will do so for 2016.
5 Long Term Incentive Plan shows the market value of the awards vested immediately following the end of the relevant performance period.
The figure for 2015 is for LTIP shares which vested on 29 July 2015 at a share price of 11.50.
Previously the value of these shares was estimated using the average share price over the period 1 April to 30 June 2015 of 10.59.

The performance is shown relative to the FTSE 100, which represents the broad market index against which the Companys shares are traded.
TSR is a measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.
Data is averaged over three months at the end of each financial year.

The table highlights the unique structure of our remuneration policy, in which vesting of LTIP shares occurs every two years rather than the customary 12-month cycle.
As our LTIP awards are made as a fixed number, the realised value is purely reflective of delivery against performance measures and any share price growth over this period, keeping it aligned to shareholders interests.
It should be noted that total remuneration for 2013 includes vesting of the one-off additional LTIP award of 300,000 shares made in 2011 at the time of the possible News Corporation bid.
The average annual total remuneration paid to the Group CEO over this seven-year period, excluding this one-off award, is 8,626,088.

Annual Report 2016 59 Value of a hypothetical 100 investment Directors remuneration report Annual remuneration implementation report continued Disclosure of Performance Targets for 2014 The Committee has discussed at length its approach to disclosure of performance targets.
Whilst maintaining its position that early disclosure of targets would be commercially detrimental because of the highly competitive nature of the market in which it operates it considers that performance targets for the 2014 annual bonus are no longer commercially sensitive.
In setting the targets the Committee gave careful consideration to the business plan and to the research analyst consensus forecasts at the time.
The targets and performance for the 2014 annual bonus are shown in the table below.
2013 14 Performance vs Performance Metric Target Performance Target Net Product Growth 2.2m 3.1m 141% Operating Profit 1,225m 1,260m 103% Operating Cash Flow 1,150m 1,284m 112% On the basis of this performance the Committee determined that the bonus was paid at 100% of maximum for the Group CEO and 100% for the Group COO & CFO.
The 201315 LTIP vested in July 2015 and it is anticipated that the performance targets will be published in the 2017 remuneration report, two years from the end of the performance period.
How do we intend to implement the remuneration policy next year?
The Committee has determined that the remuneration policy will be implemented as set out below for the year ending 30 June 2017.
Base salary The average salary increase for our employees, effective 1 July 2016, was 2.7% for those earning less than 31,000, and 2.0% for all other employees, with increases up to 10% for outstanding performance, promotions and market adjustments.
Whilst the level of personal achievement of the Executive Directors would allow for greater increases under the all employee salary review process, the Committee decided to make base salary adjustments of 2.5% each for the Group CEO and Group COO & CFO, effective 1 July 2016, to recognise their contribution without compromising the long held intent to maintain a well-leveraged package with a relatively low level of fixed pay versus our pay comparator group.
Taxable benefits and pension No changes.
Annual Bonus and Co-Investment Plan The performance measures used for the annual bonus have previously been growth in paid-for products, operating profit and operating cash flow.
For 2016 17, the Remuneration Committee decided to retain three measures, but replace growth in paid-for products with revenue growth, which the Committee believes is a more relevant indicator of success against our broader growth strategy: revenue growth captures AdSmart, third-party distribution revenue and Sky Store, none of which are captured within the narrower measure of product growth.
We expect that both of the Executive Directors will participate in the CIP for this year.
The performance conditions for the vesting of shares are as per the details set out on page 57.
Long Term Incentive Plan award The Committee agreed that Jeremy Darroch would be granted an award of 600,000 shares and Andrew Griffith would be granted an award of 350,000 shares on 29 July 2016.
This is the Year 1 award of the 20162019 Plan.
These awards will normally vest on 29 July 2019 subject to the performance measures being achieved.
The performance conditions for this award remain the same as for those made in 2014 and 2015, and operate using the same methodology as set out on pages 56 to 57.
EPS growth target and TSR vesting schedule are outlined on page 57.
Introduction of Clawback The Committee agreed to introduce a clawback provision for the annual bonus, Co-Investment and Long Term Incentive Plans, with effect for share awards granted from July 2016 and for bonus awards payable from year ending 30 June 2017.
The provision will apply at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, in cases of gross misconduct or misstatement of results.
Directors Share Interests As at the end of the financial year, the Group CEO had beneficial ownership of 628,078 shares equivalent to 5.2 x base salary and the Group COO & CFO had beneficial ownership of 143,267 shares, equivalent to 1.9 x base salary, using the year end closing share price of 8.48.
The Group CEO currently exceeds the shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors as described on page 54.
Andrew Griffith fell slightly behind the shareholding guidelines of 2x base salary using the closing share price on 30 June 2016 of 8.48.
This was due to a sharp fall in the share price at the end of the year in line with the market due to uncertainty over the EU referendum.
He has given an undertaking to the Remuneration Committee to remedy any shortfall to the required holding before 30 September 2016.
