All UK employees were chosen for this comparison as this is a broad dataset where local packages comprise each of these remuneration elements.
It is hoped to expand this comparison to additional geographies in future years.
The level of salary increase shown for the CEO reflects that part of the CEOs salary for 2015 was paid at a lower rate.
The benefits offered to all UK employees were unchanged in 2016, and constituted private medical and dental insurance.
The increase reflects changes in the cost to the Company of providing these benefits.
The increase in average UK employee bonuses is reflective of the Groups strong performance in 2016, and also the introduction in the year of a consistent bonus structure across both the legacy Optimal Payments and Skrill businesses in the UK.
Historically, incentives within Optimal had included a wider use of share plans rather than cash incentives.
