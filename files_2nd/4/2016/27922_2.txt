B5.1 Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The information provided in this part of the Directors Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Dear Shareholder The philosophy underpinning the Groups remuneration policy seeks to produce an outcome which is fair and appropriate to the Company, its Alan K Fletcher shareholders, senior executives and employees.
Company performance Chairman of the is central, with the focus being on short and long term qualitative and Remuneration Committee quantitative objectives with an emphasis on strong risk management.
Business performance The Group has made strong progress against both its operational objectives for the ongoing business and its longer term strategic objectives, notwithstanding a year marked by disruptive fiscal and regulatory change.
The growth in the Groups loan books, up 6.7% to 10,737.5 million, contributed to an increase in underlying profit by 9.1% to 146.9 million 2015: 134.7 million.
The Groups product range was expanded by the acquisition of the asset and development finance operations.
At the year-end preparation for the Groups launch of specific niche residential mortgage market products was well advanced and regulatory approvals had been obtained.
Variable pay earned in the year The Committee has reflected the positive performance in the year in applying the remuneration policy.
Performance bonuses of 75% of maximum for Mr N S Terrington and Mr R J Woodman and 62.5% of maximum for Mr J A Heron have been awarded.
In reaching this decision, the Committee has reviewed performance against a number of financial value and risk based targets and has taken individual performance into account.
In particular, the executive team has delivered above plan in a year which was particularly challenging in the second half and has continued to focus on the successful delivery of our new businesses, whilst also embedding risk management across the Group.
The objectives are detailed in section B5.2.
Full retrospective disclosure of the target range for the year ended 30 September 2016 will be included in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long term incentive awards under the Paragon Performance Share Plan PSP which were granted in December 2013 are due to mature in December 2016.
These awards are subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition, measured against the FTSE-250 Index 50% of the award, and EPS growth 50% of the award both conditions being measured over the three financial years ended 30 September 2016.
The Companys TSR performance over the period ranked below median and EPS exceeded the upper target.
The Committee will consider the financial underpin for these awards prior to vesting, however anticipate that based on these results, half of the award will vest.
Key changes to the remuneration structure for 2017 The current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM to apply for a period of three years.
Consequently, the Committee undertook a review of the policy during the year and, as a result, are proposing a few minor changes which are summarised below and in more detail at the front of the policy.
No significant changes have been made to the 2014 policy which was approved with over 94% of votes in favour.
The changes proposed are to simplify the policy, aid administration and take account of how it has been operated.
In setting our new policy the Committee has continued to take into account its key principles of ensuring that the executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual performance, having regard to retention and motivation, whilst maintaining a clear link between rewards and company performance.
PAGE 102 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The key changes proposed to the 2014 policy are: The Matching Share Plan which had not been used since 2010 has been removed from the Policy Shareholding guidelines have been formally included in the policy, in line with best practice We have formally included clawback on the cash element of the bonus although as I stated last year, this has been introduced for bonus awards in respect of the year ended 30 September 2016 For new externally appointed executive directors, the maximum contribution which may be made in respect of pension either as a contribution into a pension or as cash in lieu is 25% of salary.
This level of contribution will only be used in exceptional circumstances with the usual contribution level expected to be in the range of 10-15% For externally appointed executive directors, there will be a two year holding period applied to the PSP awards this has not been adopted for the existing executive directors on the basis that they already hold high levels of personal shareholdings : and As described in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, we are proposing, subject to shareholder approval, to make minor administrative amendments to the PSP in accordance with which the number of shares subject to the awards will ordinarily be determined by reference to the share price following the announcement of the prior years results and the awards will vest following the assessment of the performance conditions In addition, the Committee has reviewed the performance metrics attaching to the PSP awards.
Our awards over the last three years have been based on a combination of relative TSR against the FTSE-250 and EPS growth targets, with equal weighting attached to both.
As the business grows and becomes more diversified, while the level of regulation increases, the focus on effective risk management becomes of increasing importance to the long term wellbeing of the Group.
The Committee is mindful that the PSP should reflect a balance of the key performance indicators for the business.
In line with market practice in the sector and to reflect the regulatory environment and good governance for a regulated business, it has therefore been decided to introduce a risk-based element into the PSP.
This is in order to maintain the balance of internal and external measures, meaning that the risk and EPS elements will in future constitute 50% of the award.
Further details of how risk will be assessed for the PSP to be granted following the Groups results announcement are detailed in section B5.2.
Prior to 2011 the TSR performance metric for PSP awards was by reference to a bespoke comparator group as the Committee considered a sector specific group made a more appropriate means of measuring the Groups performance.
This approach became unworkable because of the number of the groups constituents that subsequently delisted, and TSR was therefore measured against the FTSE-250 index instead.
Over recent years the number of listed companies in the financial services sector has expanded allowing the Committee to consider using a bespoke group again.
Comparison to the peer group is one of the key ways the Group is benchmarked externally by analysts and internally by management in determining success and the Committee has therefore decided to reinstate the use of a bespoke group.
This consists of 13 companies and details are in Section B5.2.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 103 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE For the 2015 PSP award the EPS target for threshold was set at 3% above the rate of increase in the retail prices index RPI and the EPS target for maximum vesting was increased from 7% to 13% taking into account market expectations at that time.
For the 2016 PSP grant the EPS target for threshold vesting is being maintained at 3% above RPI and the EPS target for maximum vesting will be set at 7% above RPI which is in line with the EPS targets set for PSP awards up to 2014.
This is consistent with the reduction in market expectations since the 2015 PSP awards were granted.
The Remuneration Committee believes strongly that these EPS targets represent a high degree of stretch against the current landscape and headwinds facing the business without encouraging excessive risk.
Together with the Group Chairman, the Groups People Director and the Company Secretary, I consulted with major shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies prior to the Committees finalisation of the decisions above and received broad support.
The most important challenge for the Committee will be to continue to ensure that the remuneration policy remains appropriately structured to retain and motivate executive directors, whilst providing alignment with shareholders and, most importantly, directly linking to the achievement of the Groups strategy.
I commend this report to shareholders and ask you to support the resolutions to approve the Companys Directors Remuneration Report, the new Remuneration Policy, which, if passed by shareholders, will apply from the AGM in 2017, and the proposed amendments to the PSP at the AGM in 2017.

1 Application of policy The information provided in this part of the Directors Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Consideration by directors of matters relating to directors remuneration Remuneration Committee During the year, the Committee consisted of Alan Fletcher who chaired the Committee, Fiona Clutterbuck, Peter Hartill and Hugo Tudor, all of whom were independent non-executive directors, and the Chairman of the Company, Robert Dench.
The Board introduced a conflicts policy in 2015 which takes into account the requirements of the UK Code on Corporate Governance in recognising and managing conflicts at remuneration committees.
None of the non-executive directors who sit on the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder or debt holder, conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman of the Company does not participate in discussions on his own remuneration.
The Committee determines the Companys policy on executive remuneration and specific compensation packages for each of the executive directors and the Chairman.
No director contributes to any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews the level and structure of remuneration of senior management.
The terms of reference for the Committee, which were revised during the year to better reflect current corporate governance practice, are available on request from the Company Secretary.
In determining the directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr N S Terrington Chief Executive and the Groups People Director about its proposals.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 105 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration advisers The Committee retained the services of New Bridge Street NBS, a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited, as its independent advisor on remuneration matters until February 2016.
Deloitte LLP Deloitte became advisors from the 2016 AGM following a review process.
Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under its Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK.
During the year the Chairman of the Committee reviewed the performance of Deloitte, in terms of the quality and independence of advice, the potential for conflicts of interest which are actively managed within Deloitte and its knowledge and understanding of market practice.
Having reviewed these factors, the Committee chose to continue to retain Deloitte as its adviser in 2017.
The total fees paid to Deloitte for advice to the Remuneration Committee amounted to 68,410.
Deloitte stepped down as the Groups auditors at the AGM in 2016.
Deloitte provided other professional services during the year including regulatory and tax advice, co-sourced internal audit services, and advice relating to the Groups structured finance business.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman and executive directors The Companys policy is to ensure that the executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual performance, having regard to the importance of retention and motivation.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
The Committee also sets the salary for the Chairman, taking account of his performance and time commitment in the role.
In forming and reviewing remuneration policy the Committee has given full consideration to the Code and has complied with its provisions relating to directors remuneration throughout the year.
Moreover, the Committee has given due regard to the link between remuneration and strategy, seeking to ensure that the remuneration structures in place do not encourage excessive risk or activities that are not in line with the agreed strategy.
Contractual commitments already made to directors will continue to be honoured as part of this policy.
The remuneration packages of the individual directors are assessed after a review of their individual performances and an assessment of comparable positions in the financial sector and within a group of pan-sectoral comparators comprising a number of FTSE-250 companies with market capitalisations similar to the Company's.
The Committee pays due regard to the levels of remuneration within the Group when determining the remuneration of executive directors and other senior employees.
It also seeks to ensure that the incentive structure for directors and senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
PAGE 106 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Bank remuneration Paragon Bank PLC has its own remuneration committee, reporting to the Banks board of directors, which considers remuneration policy across the Bank including the application of the PRAs Remuneration Code Remuneration Code which governs the compensation of senior personnel in the banking sector, referred to as Remuneration Code Staff.
The Banks remuneration committee ensures that Paragon Bank complies with the Remuneration Code on an ongoing basis in respect of those employees.
The Committee reviews the work undertaken by the Banks remuneration committee through regular reports submitted to it.
At the 2015 Annual General Meeting, shareholders were asked to approve a limit of 200% on the ratio of fixed to variable components of total remuneration for individuals classified as Material Risk Takers as defined in the Remuneration Part of the PRA Rulebook and employed by Paragon Bank PLC.
In February 2016, the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority confirmed in a joint statement that this requirement would not be imposed on smaller firms.
As a result, Paragon Bank PLC is not required to impose a limit on variable remuneration for regulatory reasons.
The Group has therefore decided to seek shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM to remove the specific limit on variable pay.
The Group wishes to be aligned with the prevailing regulatory environment and to have the flexibility in its remuneration arrangements to be able to respond to future developments.
It is not currently proposing to make any changes to variable pay opportunity for Material Risk Takers, or for the Companys executive directors.

Ms F J Clutterbuck was appointed as Senior Independent Director on 1 July 2015.
Mr E A Tilly resigned from the Board on 1 July 2015.
In addition to fees earned as a non-executive director, Mr A K Fletcher serves as a director of the Corporate Trustee of The Paragon Pension Plan the Plan and receives 10,000 per annum in respect of that appointment from Paragon Finance PLC, the sponsoring company of the Plan and a subsidiary of the Company.
The Plan is a trust which is independent of the Company and, as a director of its corporate trustee, Mr Fletcher has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the trust and the Plans beneficiaries.
Allowances and benefits include private health cover, fuel benefit and company car provision.
The company car allowance paid to executive directors and the Chairman 10,000 - 12,000 is also included in allowances and benefits.
In accordance with the Regulations, the amounts shown in respect of pension accrual have been calculated by applying a factor of 20 to the increase in accrued pension, after adjusting for inflation.
In the single total figure of remuneration for the year ended 30 September 2016, the share award values are calculated by multiplying the number of shares expected to vest by the average share price over the last quarter of the year ended September 2016 290.48 pence.
In accordance with the rules of the PSP, participants are entitled on exercise to additional value equal to the dividends that would have been paid on vested shares in respect of dividend record dates between the grant date and vesting date.
Accordingly, the share award values also include 29.1 pence per vested share in respect of dividend record dates between 10 December 2013 and 10 December 2016.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 109 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE In the single total figure of remuneration for the year ended 30 September 2015, the share awards value has been restated to reflect the value of awards under the PSP that vested in respect of performance conditions with performance periods ending in that year, being the awards granted on 28 February 2013 which vested on 28 February 2016.
The share award values are calculated by multiplying the number of vested shares by the share price on 28 February 2016 308.7 pence.
Accordingly, the share award values also include 27.2 pence per vested share in respect of dividend record dates between 28 February 2013 and 28 February 2016. Dividend on vested bonus is the accrued dividends to vesting paid on deferred bonuses which were exercised during the year.
PAGE 110 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The link between pay and performance Annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2016 The annual bonus for the year under review was based on performance against financial and risk measures: performance against each of these measures is then subject to individual scale factors according to performance against personal strategic objectives.
The performance for the year, and the resulting accrual levels, were as follows: Measure Weighting Outcome Award level Financial Adjusted operating profit 33.33% 146.9m 17% performance Buy-to-let lending 1,161.0m Projected profits from Debt purchase investments lending and investment 208.8 m Future value of activities in the year 33.33% 21% Consumer lending new business and projected residual 124.7m cash flow from acquired portfolios PBAF and Premier acquired asset finance lending 144.3m The business having operated within the key Risk 33.33% See below 24% risk tolerance levels agreed by the Board Totals 100.00% Bonus achieved for 2016 62% Of maximum under scheme, subject to individual performance scale factors of 0.5 to 1.5 times.
Financial performance Operating profit for the year was in line with the target level of 147.0 million and exceeded the consensus at 30 September 2016 of 146.2 million.
Cash generation from both the originated and acquired portfolios was also strong.
Tight control was maintained over costs, with the underlying cost:income ratio remaining broadly stable in the year.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 111 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Future value Following the changes to stamp duty announced in the 2015 Autumn Statement, the Groups buy-to-let volume target for 2016 was adjusted to 1,268 million.
In anticipation of regulatory changes to underwriting the Group tightened criteria in January 2016 and increasingly focused new business activities at the more complex end of the buy-to-let market, evidenced by the increased proportion of complex cases from 48% in September 2015 to 63% in September 2016.
Despite absolute volume levels being 8.5% below the target level at 1,161 million, the margins are stronger in this part of the market, with the Groups embedded value analysis suggesting the second half of 2016s originations delivered an uplift of 6% over the average 2015 level, a position also reflected in the year end pipeline.
Debt purchase investments significantly exceeded the target of 100 million, at 208.8 million.
Within this figure, 184.8 million was completed in Paragon Bank.
Organic car finance, development finance and secured lending advances grew by 126.4% from their 2015 level at 133.8 million, however this undershot the target for the division of 174.5 million.
The asset finance business acquired in November 2015 outperformed its plan, delivering 144.3 million of new business compared to the original plan of 131.9 million, despite the integration, re-branding and system development activities being undertaken in the post-acquisition period.
Risk During the year the Group has operated within the risk tolerance levels set by the Board for capital ratios, liquidity positions, new business and operational and regulatory risk.
It has also further developed its plans to mitigate longer-term strategic risk.
Complaint levels in the year were below comparable industry levels.
We have provided target performance numbers for the financial elements of the bonus.
Full disclosure of the threshold and maximum ranges will be provided for the bonus earned for the year ended 30 September 2016 in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ending 30 September 2017 which will be when it is anticipated that this information is no longer considered commercially sensitive.
The final level of each executive directors bonus is adjusted to reflect personal performance against strategic objectives related to each of the elements.
These individual performance scale factors are between 0.5 and 1.5 times, according to performance.
The Committees assessment of performance and delivery on objectives is noted in the Chairmans letter and the objectives for the year ended 30 September 2016 are detailed below: For N S Terrington, R J Woodman and J A Heron: To deliver strategic leadership working within the parameters of the Groups risk appetite.
To deliver the planned financial performance for the year, whilst ensuring fair outcomes for customers, future profit streams and positioning the Group to meet its longer term strategic goals.
To ensure the business as a whole meets all risk, compliance and regulatory changes Additionally for R J Woodman To deliver operational improvements from regulatory and accounting changes to the Group: specifically, IRB and IFRS 9 PAGE 112 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Additionally for J A Heron In respect of the Paragon Mortgages division to: - achieve its target operating profit - achieve its target new origination volume at agreed return levels - improve application conversion rates and cost per application levels - manage resource levels to meet immediate and longer term strategic requirements - ensure the mortgage business operates within the key risk tolerance levels agreed by the Board - facilitate Paragon Bank buy-to-let lending originations - develop the product range - maintain a balanced and sustainable distribution profile Lead a strategic review of the acquired Asset Finance business Performance against the objectives is assessed by the Committee at the end of the year with input from the Chief Executive as appropriate.
Each objective is scored from 0 to 4, with target scale factor being for a score of 2, equating to a scale factor of 1.0 times, as set out in the table below: Scale factor Average score Performance 0.50 0 Poor 0.75 1 Below target 1.00 2 Target 1.25 3 Above target 1.50 4 Exceptionally good The Committee, having considered individual performance against the objectives set at the beginning of the year, has agreed the following scale factors for the year ended 30 September 2016: N S Terrington 1.2 R J Woodman 1.2 J A Heron 1.0 The resulting bonuses for 2016, after applying the scale factors to the award levels, were as follows: Executive Financial Future value Risk Scale Total Total Cash Share performance of new factor percentage of max value business capped at 100% max 33% max 33% max 33% times 000 000 000 N S Terrington 17% 21% 24% 1.2 75.0% 694 533 161 R J Woodman 17% 21% 24% 1.2 75.0% 437 340 97 J A Heron 17% 21% 24% 1.0 62.5% 308 244 64 The maximum bonus entitlement is 200% of salary for the period.
25% of amounts awarded in excess of 50,000 are deferred, to be payable in shares after three years, net of any clawback applied see below.
No further performance conditions apply to the deferred shares.
The Committee is satisfied that the level of bonus earned by each director reflects both the performance of the individual and the Group during the year.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 113 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Directors pensions The total amount charged to the profit and loss account of the Group in respect of pension provision for directors was 414,000 2015: 397,000.
Mr N S Terrington, Mr R J Woodman and Mr J A Heron were members of the Group defined benefit pension plan during the year.
Their entitlements under the Plan are shown below.
Director Description of entitlement Accumulated total accrued annual pension at 30 September 2016 2015 000 000 N S Terrington Entitled to 1 48.375th of final salary per year of service, payable from 178 174 age 60.
May take reduced early retirement from age 55.
Ceased pension accrual on 6 April 2006 but retains final salary linkage.
R J Woodman Entitled to 1 46.625th of final salary per year of service, payable from 62 61 age 60.
Ceased pension accrual on 9 October 2007 and opted out of final salary linkage from 1 April 2011.
J A Heron Entitled to 1 49.125th of final salary per year of service, payable from 100 98 age 60.
The pension accrual figure included in the single total figure of remuneration table represents the increase in the accrued pension, excluding the effect of CPI inflation, during the year multiplied by 20, in accordance with the methodology set out in the Regulations.
The entitlements shown above represent the weighted average of service years for which accrual was earned at 1 60 of final salary and those for which accrual was earned at 1 37.5.
The executive directors have each ceased pension accrual, as shown in the table above.
This was in return for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards future service benefits had each individual stayed within the Plan for his future service accrual.
These contributions in respect of further pension provision for each of the directors are shown as pension allowance in the single total figure of remuneration table.
Share-based awards Paragon Performance Share Plan Vesting: Awards granted in December 2013 under the Groups PSP which will vest in December 2016 are subject to performance conditions measured over three financial years ended 30 September 2016, with 50% based on comparing the Groups relative TSR performance against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 and 50% based on assessment against EPS growth targets.
The vesting percentage will be reviewed by the Committee against a financial underpin.
The Company was ranked below median for the TSR element, which will therefore not vest.
EPS targets required growth to exceed RPI plus 7% over each of the three financial years for the full amount to vest and this has been achieved.
Consequently, 50% of the awards will vest, subject to the Committee determining, prior to vesting, that such level of vesting is consistent with the Companys financial performance.
PAGE 114 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Grants: The awards granted in December 2015 were calculated so as to have a face value of 200% of salary, using the average closing mid-market price of the Companys shares on each of the five dealing days up to and including the day before the grant date 3.5634.
Therefore, the face value of the awards granted during the year were 926,000 for Mr Terrington, 583,000 for Mr Woodman and 494,000 for Mr Heron.
25% of the awards would vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
50% of these awards are subject to the TSR test, as above, and 50% are subject to an EPS test.
The EPS test provides that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus a lower threshold, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus an upper threshold or more.
For awards granted between February 2013 and December 2014 the lower threshold was 3% and the upper threshold 7%.
For awards granted in December 2015 the lower threshold was 3% and the upper threshold was 13%.
In each case the testing period is the three financial years commencing with the year of grant.
The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 115 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Corporate Governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Sharesave Plan Awards made under the Sharesave Plan are granted to directors on the same terms which are available to employees in general.
Rights to further shares under the DSBP are due to be granted in respect of the compulsory deferral of performance bonuses for the year ended 30 September 2016, shown in the single total figure of remuneration table above.
The number of shares to be awarded will be determined based on the average market price of the Companys shares on the five dealing days before the awards are granted.
The shares, less any clawback, which can be applied by the Remuneration Committee in certain circumstances, will be exercisable by the recipients from the third anniversary of the grant date, subject, in normal circumstances, to the recipient being employed by the Company at that time.

For new appointments the guideline was 100% of salary by the fifth anniversary of their appointment, increasing to 200% by the seventh anniversary.
The number, net of income tax and national insurance, of vested but unexercised shares granted under the DSBP and under the PSP count towards the aggregate shares held by each director in respect of the policy.

At 30 September 2016, all of the executive directors holdings were in accordance with guideline levels.
From 1 October 2016 onwards the Committee has amended its guidelines so that all directors, whenever appointed, are required to hold shares to a value of 200% of their salary and will be required to retain 50% net of a vested PSP or DSBP award until that level is reached.
The guidelines applying from 1 October 2016 are set out in the Directors Remuneration Policy in section B5.3.
The Committee has decided, for the present, not to mandate that executive directors hold awards granted under the PSP for an additional period after the vesting date given the level of personal shareholdings of the current executive directors and their commitment to the Company over many years.
For new external appointments the Committee has introduced a holding period to encourage share participation applied to the PSP awards.

3 Application of remuneration policy for the year ending 30 September 2017 The information provided in this section of the Directors Remuneration Report is not subject to audit Salary The Chairmans fee and executive directors salaries are determined by the Committee immediately prior to the start of each financial year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers remuneration levels within the Group as a whole, individual and business performance during the year and remuneration in comparable FTSE-250 companies.
The current Chairmans fee and the salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 October 2016 are as follows: Position Director Fee salary with effect from 1 October 2016 1 October 2015 Chairman R G Dench 240,000 240,000 Chief Executive N S Terrington 474,270 462,700 Group Finance Director R J Woodman 298,685 291,400 Director - Mortgages J A Heron 252,870 246,700 The Committee agreed that the salaries of Mr N S Terrington, Mr R J Woodman and Mr J A Heron would be increased by 2.5% from 1 October 2016.
This is in line with the level of increases for the Groups wider workforce.
The non-executive directors fees have been benchmarked against the wider market during the year and it was agreed that the present levels were appropriate.
Consequently, from 1 October 2016 the fees remain as follows: Base fee 50,000 2015: 50,000 Additional fee for Senior Independent Director 20,000 2015: 20,000 Additional fee for chairmen of committees 20,000 2015: 20,000 The additional fee for chairmen of committees is currently payable to the Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit and Risk and Compliance Committees, but would be payable for the chairmanship of such additional Committees as might be authorised by the Board.
The Companys Articles of Association include a limit on the total aggregate fees that can be paid to non-executive directors.
The present limit of 400,000 was approved by the shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting.
Pension contributions There will be no change to the operation of the pension policy for the executive directors in the year ending 30 September 2017.
However, the Committee will review the level of these benefits during the year.
Benefits There will be no change to the benefit provision for the directors.
PAGE 120 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Corporate Governance 2016 Annual Report and Accounts CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Performance bonuses For the year ending 30 September 2017, the annual bonus will be based on performance against the following performance measures: 1 operational profit, 2 future value of new business and 3 risk, each with equal weightings together with each directors performance against strategic and personal objectives, which will determine the level of a scale factor to be applied of between 0.5 and 1.5 times.
The Committee has chosen not to disclose, in advance, the performance targets for the forthcoming year as these are felt to be commercially sensitive.
Retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be set out in next years Annual Report on Remuneration except to the extent that any measure target remains commercially sensitive.
For the avoidance of doubt, there will be no change to the maximum potential bonus and executive directors will be required to defer 25% of amounts awarded in excess of 50,000 in shares.
The Committee may require higher levels of deferment or the executive may elect to defer a greater proportion.
Share awards For PSP awards in the year ending 30 September 2017, 50% of any award will be subject to a TSR test and 50% subject to a combination of EPS and risk based metrics.
The TSR test compares the rank of the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies.
Due to a lack of comparable companies over recent years, the Committee has used the FTSE-250 index as the comparator group since 2011, however, for awards to be made in respect of the year ending 30 September 2017, TSR will be compared against a group of specific companies in the financial services sector as the Committee considers that this is the best measure of performance.
25% of awards vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The EPS test will account for 25% of the overall PSP award and provides that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where annual EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 3%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for annual EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 7% or more.
The risk element will account for 25% of the overall PSP award and will be based on a number of risk and compliance factors which will be taken into consideration by the Committee at the time of vesting.
This will include assessing evidence of wider risk management performance and the application of a strong risk culture across the Group, taking into account the businesss risk tolerance levels.
Included will be broad risk appetite metrics, material regulatory breaches, customer service, management of liquidity and capital risk, credit losses against risk appetite and other material risk events over the performance period.
Disclosure of the assessment against performance of the risk element will be made in the Annual Report on Remuneration when the awards vest.
In addition, prior to any awards vesting under any element, the Committee must be satisfied that the requirements of a financial underpin test have been met.
As described in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, we are proposing, subject to shareholder approval, to make minor administrative amendments to the Performance Share Plan in accordance with which the number of shares subject to the awards will ordinarily be determined by reference to the share price following the announcement of the 2016 results and the awards will vest following the assessment of the performance conditions.
For the avoidance of doubt, no change is proposed to the award quantum for executive directors.
