Other than advice on remuneration, no other services were provided by Kepler to the Company or any other part of the MMC group of companies with the exception of unrelated insurance brokerage services.
The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2016 based on time and materials totalled 33,532, excluding expenses and VAT.

Summary of shareholder voting at the 2016 AGM The table below shows the results of the advisory vote on the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration at the AGM on 20 May 2016: Annual Report on Remuneration Total number % of of votes votes cast For including discretionary 284,334,705 65.75% Against 148,095,988 34.25% Total votes cast excluding withheld votes 434,265,280 Votes withheld 1,834,587 Note: Votes withheld are not included in the final proxy figures as they are not recognised as votes in law.
The current Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM, and received 74% support.
com 61 Directors remuneration report continued The Board is mindful of the shareholders who voted against the Annual Report on Remuneration, which related principally to the salary increase awarded to the CEO in November 2015, and the use of year-end salary to calculate his bonus entitlement.
As set out in the 2015 report, the salary increase related to the commencement of production from Inmaculada in August 2015.
The Committee believes the size of the increase is justified in the context of market pay data which was reviewed again during 2016 as part of an extensive benchmarking analysis and strong Company and individual performance.
In respect of the bonus calculation, the Committee acknowledges that this approach may not be considered appropriate where salary is reviewed later in the year, and has revised the approach to align with best practice with effect from 2016.
The Committee is committed to listening to and engaging with the views of our shareholders and takes an interest in voting outcomes.
The Committee will continue to be transparent in our remuneration decision-making and to engage with our shareholders on remuneration matters.

Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2016 audited Performance-related annual bonus in respect of 2016 performance Objectives for the 2016 bonus were set by the Committee at the beginning of the year and a provisional assessment of performance during the year was undertaken at the December Committee meeting, which was confirmed in March 2017.
Further details of the bonuses paid for 2016, including the specific performance metrics, weightings and performance against each of the metrics, are provided in the table below: Targets Target Performance Objective KPI weighting Threshold Target Maximum assessment Profitable production and Production 35% 32m Oz Aq Eq 35.5m Oz Ag Eq 1 financial results EBITDA 18% US$175m US$181m US$191m US$219.9m 1 All-in Sustaining Cost AISC 12% US$13.2 Oz US$13.0 Oz US$12.8 Oz US$12.4 Oz Sustaining capex 10% US$115m US$109m US$99m US$97.4m Safety awareness Frequency rate 15% 2.18 2.08 1.98 2.20 Severity rate 10% 540 450 300 137.71 1 Adjusted as described in the final paragraph below.
The determination of the bonus payout is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account performance during the year against the above scorecard.

Objectives which are considered critical to the Group are given higher weightings, such that outperformance in these areas contributes more significantly to the overall bonus outcome.

The Committee assessed performance against the scorecard and the CEOs performance in 2016.
A number of adjustments were made in line with the Companys usual practice to maintain the quality of earnings by primarily disregarding the impact of factors outside of managements control such as the price of silver and gold as compared to the budgeted prices and the impact of any hedging approved by the Board.
The Committees assessment of performance resulted in the award of a bonus to the CEO of 125% of salary 83.3% of maximum.
