38 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Remuneration report Introduction I am pleased to introduce the Remuneration report for the financial year 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2016.
At our 2015 Annual General Meeting, our remuneration policy was approved.
No changes are being made to that policy which is reproduced for reference at page 100 of this Annual Report.
Shareholder feedback The Companys remuneration policy and remuneration report received a significant percentage of votes against at the 2015 Annual General Meeting 36.5% and 37.7% respectively.
The majority of these votes against were attributable to one shareholder who voted against a number of other resolutions.
Feedback received at the time of the 2015 Annual General Meeting included concern over the potential size of bonus and long-term incentive plan LTIP awards in situations where the Committee relied on the exceptional circumstances provision in the remuneration policy.
In response to this, the Committee has claried that bonus and LTIP awards relying on the exceptional circumstances provision will only be made following consultation with larger shareholders.
The Board wanted to ensure shareholders views were heard and during the year the Chairman and I have met with a number of the larger shareholders to better understand any concerns.
Meetings were offered to shareholders representing 58% of the shareholder base.
The meetings focused on the following key points: k The reasons behind the introduction of the new remuneration policy at last years AGM principally the impending transaction with AAM that required the introduction of a new policy to allow payments to executive Directors following the sale of Aberdeen SVG Private Equity Managers Limited ASVGM to Aberdeen Asset Management plc AAM : k The principal changes from the prior Group remuneration policy including the newly introduced Chief Executives shareholding requirement: bonus deferral: introduction of malus and clawback: and reduction in the quantum of potential LTIP awards now based on a multiple ofsalary only, not salary and bonus : k clarification of the proposed operation of the current policy including that the maximum limits for bonus and LTIP awards would only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances and following consultation with major shareholders : k The proposed vesting targets for LTIPs of 7% 0% vesting to 15% 100% vesting growth in TSR and NAV over a three and four-year period respectively: and k The remuneration package for the Chief Executive which has been materially reduced in recognition of the reduced scope of the role following the sale of the Companys remaining interest in ASVGM to AAM, including a reduction in salary for the role from 367,500 to 300,000 p. a.
The potential for carried interest to be awarded to the Chief Executive was also discussed and it was noted that any entitlement would likely not be a material part of the Chief Executives package and would result in a commensurate reduction of other variable elements of remuneration in accordance with the policy.
Developments during the year At the time of last years AGM, the Company was managed by ASVGM, which was a member of the AAM group of companies.
Accordingly all staff who provided management services to the Company through ASVGM including the Companys Chief Executive were paid pursuant to the AAM remuneration policy only in the financial year to 31 January 2015.
During 2015, the Companys remaining 49.9% interest in ASVGM was sold to AAM and a new manager, SVGC Managers Limited awholly owned subsidiary of the Company was appointed as investment manager with effect from 1 October 2015.
Accordingly, theremuneration report that follows covers remuneration that was paid pursuant to the AAM policy for part of the year and pursuant to the Companys policy for the balance.
Despite the fact that the Chief Executive was employed by AAM for part of the year, all awards of variable compensation to the Chief Executive during the period have been made under the Companys policy.
These were awarded with reference to the weighted average salary earned by the Chief Executive in the period.
The net impact of this is a significant reduction in the variable elements of compensation from prior years.
From 1 October 2015, all remuneration has been, and will continue to be paid, under the Companys policy.
Strategic report | Corporate information | Financial information | Shareholder information 39 Performance in the year A number of metrics both financial and non-financial were used to assess Company and management performance during the year: NAV growth net asset value NAV per share increased by 11% over the year.
Total Shareholder Return TSR the share price increased from 435p to 491p over the year.
After adjusting for the tender offers in May 2015 and January 2016, Total Shareholder Return was 14%.
Capital allocation the Company continued to exercise discipline in its capital allocation strategy.
167 million was returned to shareholders by way of tender offers and share buybacks.
67 million of debt was repaid through the repurchase of convertible bonds.
New fund commitments of $100 million were made during the year and $12 million of co-investments were made.
Portfolio performance the portfolio of fund investments and co-investments has performed strongly in the year.
The commitments made since the adoption of the new strategy are performing well, with some good, early realisations.
Management team the Companys interest in ASVGM was sold to AAM during the year.
This necessitated the establishment of a new wholly-owned management subsidiary and the transfer of personnel from ASVGM to this new subsidiary.
This complex transaction was executed by the management team, and the Company has retained the expertise it requires through that process.
In addition, two new investment professionals have joined the management team.
Culture the management team in place is now focused solely on delivering on the Companys strategy.
Robust risk management and compliance regimes have been put in place to ensure that all staff are focused on these important issues in their day-to-day roles.
Investment discipline has developed into a key philosophy of the Company and appropriate processes and procedures have been implemented to ensure this remains the case.
Supplementary to this is the desire to form partnership relationships with our underlying managers and progress has been made in developing those existing relationships and a select few, potential new relationships.
The Committee did not set specic management objectives at the start of the year, as the management team was employed by AAM at that time.
However, the Committee has reviewed the results described above and takes the view that the Chief Executive has performed very strongly across the range of both financial and non-financial metrics.
Activities of the Remuneration Committee The Committee met on four occasions in the year.
It formulated the remuneration policy that was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
It continued to operate the existing LTIP and deferred bonus schemes and approved changes to those schemes introducing malus and clawback.
It met to consider the Chief Executives new remuneration package and to approve the bonus for the year and the award of LTIPs.
Looking forward the Committee remains committed to maintaining a remuneration policy that attracts and retains talent and rewards achievement of strategic goals, thereby aligning management and shareholders, while encouraging prudence from a risk perspective.
The Committee monitors regulatory and market developments and will seek to ensure that the policy evolves, if necessary, to reect these.
Helen Mahy CBE Chairman, Remuneration Committee 22 March 2016 40 SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2016 Remuneration report continued Report on remuneration implementation This report is prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
Directors emoluments Directors are only entitled to fees at such rates as are determined by the Board from time to time in accordance with the remuneration policy.
None of the non-executive Directors has any entitlement to pensions or pension related benets, medical or life insurance schemes, share options, long-term incentive plans, or performance related payments.
No non-executive Director is entitled to any other monetary payment or any assets of the Company.
Accordingly the single total gure table for non-executive Directors below does not include columns for any of these items or their monetary equivalents.
Directors & Ofcers insurance is maintained and paid for by the Company on behalf of the Directors.
In line with market practice the Company has agreed to indemnify the Directors in respect of costs, charges, losses, liabilities, damages and expenses, arising out of any claims or proposed claims made for negligence, default, breach of duty, breach of trust or otherwise, or relating to any application under Section 1157 of the Companies Act 2006, in connection with the performance of their duties as Directors of the Company.
The indemnities would also provide financial support from the Company should the level of cover provided by the Directors & Ofcers insurance maintained by the Company be exhausted.
Details of the implementation of the remuneration policy are set out below.
The Committee appointed New Bridge Street a trading name of Aon plc to provide general remuneration advice and specic advice on the operation of its long term incentive plans including the introduction of malus and clawback into the Companys share schemes.
New Bridge Street helped establish these plans and was therefore well placed to advise on them.
Neither New Bridge Street nor any other part of the Aon Corporation provided other services to the Company during the year and the Committee was therefore comfortable with their objectivity and independence.
Fees of 24,257 were paid to New Bridge Street during the period.
Single total gure tables Set out below, are single total gure tables for non-executive Directors and the executive Director.
Non-executive Directors are paid their fees by the Company.
