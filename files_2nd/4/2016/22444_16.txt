Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Governance Directors remuneration report Remuneration policy 2017 As mentioned above, the committee undertook a comprehensive review of senior executive remuneration at the Company and found that the current structure comprising base salary, benefits, a profit-related annual bonus and annual awards of performance shares remains appropriate.
The committee has, however, strengthened the alignment between executives and shareholders by increasing the share ownership guideline for all Executive Directors.
The remuneration policy at Clarksons has been designed to attract and retain the best talent in our markets, while at the same time ensuring a close alignment between the interests of shareholders and management.

The long-term incentive plan LTIP performance measures, earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR, reward significant long-term returns to shareholders and long-term financial growth.
EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements while TSR performance is monitored on the remuneration committees behalf by New Bridge Street.

Only modest rewards are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year.
3 The committee operates the annual bonus and LTIPs according to their respective rules, and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
Consistent with market practice, the committee retains flexibility and discretions in a number of key areas.
4 The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the Group as a whole and is consistent between the Executive Directors and the remainder of the workforce.
The annual bonus plan operates on a similar profit-driven basis across the Group and there is a relatively high level of employee share ownership.
The key differences in policy for Executive Directors relate to participating in the LTIP awards, which have strict vesting conditions.
This is considered appropriate to provide a link for a proportion of performance pay with the longer-term strategy thereby creating stronger alignment of interest with shareholders.
The committee does not formally consult with employees in respect of the design of the Companys Executive Director remuneration policy, although the committee will keep this under review.
5 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors remuneration policy, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into in the previous remuneration policy or with current or former Directors such as, the payment of a pension or the vesting or exercise of past share awards that have been disclosed in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.
Directors remuneration scenarios The Companys remuneration policy results in a proportionate breakdown of total remuneration such that, in line with most other wholesale brokerage and agency companies, a very high proportion of the package is performance-related.
The charts below show an estimate of the potential remuneration payable for the Executive Directors in office on 1 January 2017 at different levels of performance.
The charts highlight that the performance-related elements of the package comprise a highly significant portion of the Executive Directors total remuneration at target and maximum performance.

2 The value of taxable benefits is estimated at 2016 values.
3 The value of the pension receivable is up to 15% of basic salary.
4 - Minimum performance assumes no award is earned under the annual bonus plan and no vesting is achieved under the LTIP: - on-target performance assumes an annual bonus calculated by reference to market expectations at the start of 2017 and 50% being achieved under the LTIP: and - maximum performance assumes profit before taxation outperforms consensus and full vesting under the LTIP.
It should, however, be noted that there is in fact no upper limit as explained on page 59 and the above charts are purely for illustrative purposes.
5 Share price movement has been excluded from the above analysis.
com 61 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Directors recruitment and promotions The remuneration committee has the objective to attract and retain the best talent in our markets, while at the same time ensuring executive pay is aligned to the corporate plan and business goals as well as supporting the interests of shareholders.
If a new Executive Director was appointed, the Company would seek to align the remuneration package with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders, including the maximum limit for the LTIP and an annual bonus pool entitlement in line with the existing policy.
An LTIP award could be made shortly following an appointment assuming the Company is not in a close period.
Flexibility is retained to offer remuneration on appointment in respect of remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The committee will look to replicate the arrangements being forfeited as closely as possible and, in doing so, will take account of relevant factors including the nature of the deferred remuneration, performance conditions and the time over which they would have vested or been paid.
The initial notice period for a service contract may be longer than the policy of one year, provided it reduces to one year within a short space of time.
For an internal appointment, any ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
The remuneration committee may also agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
Directors service contracts and payments for loss of office The remuneration committee reviews the contractual terms for Executive Directors in light of developments in best practice and trends in our sector.
The remuneration-related elements of the current contracts for Executive Directors are shown in the table below: Provision Detailed terms Notice period One year by the Company or the Director.
Termination payment Chief Executive Officer: The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to 12 months base salary plus the cost of contractual benefits: plus an amount equivalent to 50% of the last bonus received.
In addition: if not already paid, any bonus in respect of the prior year is payable if not agreed, an amount equal to the last bonus received : and a pro-rated bonus for the period of the year worked is payable.
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer: The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to base salary, benefits and bonus for the relevant period of notice.
President of Broking and Investment Banking: The Company may elect to pay in lieu of notice: an amount equivalent to base salary and contractual benefits for the relevant period of notice only.
The remuneration committee recognises that it is unusual in the context of listed PLCs to pay an amount in lieu of annual bonus for the notice period for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer but considers that the policy is appropriate for the following reasons: salary forms a lower proportion of remuneration than in most other UK companies: typically, in the shipbroking industry, income from business conducted is received over a number of years in arrears: bonuses are only payable if profit thresholds and targets are achieved i. e. there is no automatic entitlement to a bonus: and unvested awards under the LTIP are capable of vesting subject to performance.
For unvested entitlements to share awards under the 2004 Clarkson LTIP which reached the end of its ten year life in May 2014, the rules contain discretionary provisions setting out the treatment of awards where a participant ceases to be employed by the Group for designated reasons.
In the case of the participants injury, disability, statutory redundancy, retirement, a sale of their employing company or business in which they were employed or for any other reason at the discretion of the committee, the participants awards will not be forfeited but will vest on the date of cessation of employment, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions.
In the case of a participants death, any unvested awards will vest in full on the date of cessation.
For unvested entitlements to share awards under the 2014 Clarkson LTIP, where a participant ceases to be employed by the Group due to ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, a sale of his employing company or business or for any other reason at the discretion of the committee good leaver circumstance, then he will be entitled to keep his award as described below: performance-related awards will normally vest at the normal vesting dates unless the remuneration committee determines that they should vest upon cessation subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and time pro-rating unless the remuneration committee decides to disapply time pro-rating.
In the case of, death or ill-health, awards will vest at cessation subject to the relevant performance conditions: and deferred bonus awards will vest in full.

In these circumstances, the Chief Executive Officers notice period is reduced to four weeks.
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer: Within one year of a change of control the executive or the Company may give notice of not less than four weeks in the case of the former whereupon the executive will receive immediately an amount equivalent to one years basic salary, contractual benefits, employer pension contributions and annual bonus.
President of Broking and Investment Banking: No change of control provisions exist.
All unvested awards under the 2004 Clarkson LTIP would vest, to the extent that any performance conditions attaching to the relevant award have been achieved.
All unvested awards under the 2014 Clarkson LTIP would vest, in respect of performancerelated awards, the extent of vesting would be subject to any performance conditions attaching to the relevant award have been achieved and any time pro-rating applied at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
In August 2008 it was contractually agreed with the current Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Woyda, that no time pro-rating will be applied to his LTIP awards.
The remuneration committee recognises that it is now unusual, in the context of listed PLCs, for service contracts to contain change of control provisions and will therefore seek to avoid such provisions for future executive appointments to the Board.

Each appointment can be terminated before the end of the three-year period with three months notice due.
Fees payable for a new Non-Executive Director appointment will take into account the experience of the individual and the current fee structure.

In particular there has been a widespread salary freeze for employees earning salaries of 100,000 p. a. or more.
In contrast, salaries for lower paid employees have generally increased on average across the population each year.
Annual bonus for 2017 For 2017, the annual bonus opportunity will remain on the same basis as previous years and will continue to be based on a bonus pool derived from Group profit before tax as follows: below a profit floor set by the committee no bonus is triggered: and above the floor, an escalating percentage of profits is payable into a bonus pool for progressively higher profit before tax performance.
Profit for bonus calculations may be adjusted by the remuneration committee where appropriate and do not include mark-to-market valuations or business that has not been invoiced.
The profit floor and challenges for 2017 have not been disclosed on a prospective basis as these are considered to be commercially sensitive although disclosure will be provided retrospectively.
The threshold and maximum targets are higher than those that applied for 2016.
Consistent with the policy applied to the majority of senior employees, 90% of the bonus payable will be paid in cash with 10% deferred into restricted shares vesting four years after grant.
Executive Directors have agreed to this deferral, although they have no contractual obligation to defer bonuses.
Clawback provisions will continue to apply as previously highlighted, in circumstances of misstatement or error.
Long-term incentive awards to be granted in 2017 Consistent with past practice, it is envisaged that: Executive Directors will receive LTIP awards over shares worth up to 150% of salary in 2017. the vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys EPS for 31 December 2019, as shown in chart i below.
The EPS for 2016 is shown black line for reference: and the vesting of the remaining 50% will be determined by the Companys TSR performance from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019 against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts, as shown in chart ii below.
The level of total shareholder return achieved against the FTSE 250 Index over the last three year cycle is shown black line for reference.
EPS and relative TSR are considered to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the Group, in that they ensure executives are incentivised and rewarded for the earnings performance of the Group as well as returning value to shareholders.
The awards will be subject to clawback provisions.
