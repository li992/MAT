The differential between the 2016 and prior year figures for IanKing reflects his first salary increase in 2016 since 2012.

The BAE Systems UK employee population has been chosen as this employee comparator group reflects the local employment conditions of the ChiefExecutive for the purpose of this comparison.
Pay ratio of Chief Executive to average employee The ratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the entire Group over the last three years was asfollows: 2014 2015 2016 1 Chief Executives remuneration 000 3,519 2,929 3,463 2 Average employee remuneration 000 58 62 67 Ratio 60:1 47:1 52:1 1.
The Chief Executives remuneration is calculated on the same basis as the single figure of remuneration table.
Average employee remuneration is based on staff costs calculated on the same basis as note 3 to the Group accounts, excluding social security costs andUS healthcare costs.
The Committee is mindful of the relationship between Chief Executive remuneration and remuneration of the wider BAE Systems employee population.
Therefore, in line with our commitment to transparency, the table above provides theratio of remuneration of the Chief Executive to the average employee of the Group for the past three years.
As can be seen, the ratio has typically been around 50:1, with the ratio being higher in 2014 as a result of the partial vesting ofLong-Term Incentive awards in that year.
The ratio could range from around 20:1 to 100:1 depending on the level of performance against the measures which drive the Annual and Long-Term Incentive Plans.

Ian King and Peter Lynas have accrued defined benefit pensions which are reduced if they are taken before normal retirement age.
In addition, alongevity adjustment factor is applied to their pension accrued after 5 April 2006 to mitigate against life expectancy changes.
Their figures allow forthe current factors in force, whereas in practicethe factors are updated annually and those in force at retirement will be applied.
The defined benefit figure includes both funded and unfunded arrangements for Ian King and Peter Lynas.
Peter Lynas accrued benefit will be restated next year to allow for the impact of his divorce, once finalised.
However, the added pension value receivedin 2016 will be unaffected.
Accrued benefit for Ian King and Peter Lynas is annual pension payable on retirement.
Accrued benefit for Jerry DeMuro is the total value of his Section401 k account, including both employee and company contributions as well as investment returns.
Accrued benefit for Charles Woodburn isthe totalvalue of his defined contribution account, including employee contributions and investment returns.
Ian King and Peter Lynas are members of the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme ExPS and the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan which together provide a pension for executive directors payable at 62 of 1 30th of three-year average final salary for each year of service subject to the payment of members contributions currently 8%.
Benefits paid prior to age 62 will be subject to actuarial reduction.
The ExPS tops up the underlying employee plan to provide a target benefit for executive directors payable from normal retirement age of 1 30th of Final Pensionable Pay FPP for each year of ExPS pensionable service subject to a maximum of two-thirds of FPP.
FPP is defined as annual base salary averaged over the last 12 months prior to leaving service in respect of service accrued to 5 April 2006 and 36 months prior to leaving in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
The ExPS also provides a lump sum death-in-service benefit equal to four times base salary at date of death, and a spouses death-in-service pension equal to two-thirds of the prospective pension at normal retirement age.
Spouses pensions arealso payable upon death in retirement and death after leaving the Companys employment with a deferred pension.
Once in payment, pensions are increased annually by the rise in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum increase of 5% per year in respect of pre-6 April 2006 service and 2.5% per year in respect of service from 6 April 2006.
Ian King and Peter Lynas joined the ExPS in 1999.
BAE Systems Annual Report 2016 | 91 Strategic report Directors report Financial statements The 2000 Plan provides a pension of 1 50th of Final Pensionable Earnings FPE for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 65 and members pay contributions of 8% of Pensionable Earnings.
FPE under the 2000 Plan is the best consecutive three-year average of base salary and bonus in the ten Plan Years prior to leaving, less an offset for State pensions.
The Company decided in 2006 to limit pensionable bonuses in the 2000 Plan in the 2006 07 Plan Year to 20% of base salary and to 10% of base salary for the 2007 08 Plan Year and thereafter.
However, there is a guarantee that the FPE figure for benefits in respect of service prior to 6 April 2007 will not be less than the FPEfigure at 5 April 2007 to ensure that employees do not lose the benefit of contributions paid on past bonuses.
IanKing and Peter Lynas have 33 years and 6 months and 31 years and 2 months service, respectively, in the 2000 Plan.
The review of pension policies carried out in 2010 by the Committee concluded that the pension benefits should continue to be based on the Companys registered pension schemes and that, in appropriate circumstances, the Company will continue to have the option to offer an unfunded pension promise so as to mitigate the impact of further reductions to the Lifetime Allowance and the impact of the reduced Annual Allowance.
Ian King and Peter Lynas were given the choice to remain in the current arrangement and pay the increased tax or to take an unfunded promise: they both elected for the latter.
The Committee has decided that in cases where the Company is to pay an unfunded promise, executives will be given the choice to commute some or all of the benefit for a taxable lump sum, or take it as pension.
Where an unfunded pension is taken, ten years after retirement, the executive will be given a further opportunity to commute the residual value of the unfunded pension for a lump sum.
Therefore, Ian Kings and Peter Lynas individual total pensions are the sum of their 2000 Plan benefits plus the top-up from the ExPS, most of which is provided through the unfunded promise referred to above.
Jerry DeMuro participates in a Section 401 k defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which thecompany will match his contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of salary, up to US regulatory limits 2016 $15,900: 2017 $16,200.
In 2016, the company paid contributions of $14,867 into this arrangement.
Charles Woodburn participates in the BAE Systems Executive Pension Scheme Defined Contribution Retirement Plan EPSDCRP, which is a defined contribution arrangement for senior executives.
Charles Woodburn contributes the maximum 10,000 per annum into the EPS DCRP arrangement as permitted by the Annual Allowance limit and a 19% salary supplement is paid in lieu of the Company contributions.

The arrangements are strictly in accordance with the Companys remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the AGM on 7 May 2014, and the rules of the Companys 2000 Pension Plan andExecutive Pension Scheme outlined in the 2015 Annual Report.

Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests Minimum Shareholding Requirement MSR Executive directors are compulsorily required to establish and maintain a minimum personal shareholding equal to a setpercentage of base salary.
An Initial Value must be achieved as quickly as possible using shares vesting or options exercised through the executive share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive schemes by retaining 50% of the net value i. e. the value after deduction of exercise costs and tax of shares acquired under these schemes.
Once the Initial Value is achieved, a Subsequent Value must be achieved in the same way, except that a minimum of 25% of the net value must be retained on each exercise or acquisition.
Shares owned beneficially by the director and his her spouse count towards the MSR.
The MSR does not apply after the individual has ceased to be a director.
Any case of non-compliance would be dealt with by the Committee.
The following table sets out MSR Initial Value and Subsequent Value: Initial Value Subsequent Value Ian King 150% 300% Charles Woodburn 100% 200% Peter Lynas 100% 200% Jerry DeMuro 175% 350% Ian King and Peter Lynas were both in excess of their Subsequent Value MSR at 31 December 2016.
Jerry DeMuro joined the Board in 2014 and his personal holding of shares in the Company at 31 December 2016 stood at 53%.

There are no shareholding requirements for the Chairman or the non-executive directors.
