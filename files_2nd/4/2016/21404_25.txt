Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report I am pleased to introduce our Directors Remuneration Report for 2016 which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board.
Introduction Susan Kilsby This has been a year of change for the Group whilst at the same time the UK Chairman of the executive remuneration landscape is going through an unprecedented level of Remuneration Committee uncertainty as shareholders, companies and the Government look at the current practice of companies in the listed space.
As a result of the above I have consulted with shareholders a number of times during the year on the key remuneration issues which are set out below.
Key issues considered by the Remuneration Committee in 2016 A Landmark Aviation The acquisition and associated fundraising relating to the transformational Directors Landmark Aviation acquisition had a number of consequences that the Remuneration Committee considered.
Remuneration Due to the rationale behind the transaction, its scale and the equity issue, the Committee decided to undertake a review of its impact on BBA Aviations in-flight share based awards.
As I said in my statement last year, we had already determined that no adjustment should be made to the 2013 awards due to the short amount of Report performance period remaining at the point the acquisition occurred.
I discussed our proposals for the awards made in 2014 and 2015 with our larger shareholders.
I am very grateful for the time and effort taken by shareholders during the consultation and I am happy that broadly the approach proposed by the Committee set out below has been supported.
Following the consultation with shareholders the Committee concluded that no changes should be made to the targets for the 2014 awards due to vest in March 2017.
However, it was agreed that a minor adjustment should be made to the ROIC targets for the awards granted in 2015 due to vest in 2018.
The Committee also clarified the calculation methodology for both the ROIC and EPS elements to increase transparency.
The methodology is set out on page 64.
B New Directors Remuneration Policy The Committee is engaged in a consultation with shareholders on a new Remuneration Policy as this report goes to print.
The Committees intention was initially to seek shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.
However whilst the overall approach has been determined: the Committee, in consultation with shareholders, continues to work through some of the detail of the proposals.
This process has been more time consuming than anticipated due to the level of change and uncertainty in the UK surrounding executive remuneration.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee intends to finalise the consultation over the next few months and will put a revised policy to a formal vote at the 2018 AGM.
56 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report The overall approach being proposed by the Committee is set out below.
Long-Term Awards granted in 2014 Where the changes can be made within the existing Policy and where based on The LTIP awards granted in 2014 will vest at 23.3% of the maximum.
Additional detail consultation to date shareholders are supportive they will be operated in 2017. on these long-term awards is on page 64.
Changes within the current Policy: After careful consideration, the Committee has decided to calculate the level of bonus earned and the level of the 2014 LTIP award vesting based on the audited a ELTIP this Plan will not be operated going forward and will not form part numbers, making no adjustments.
This approach has been adopted to recognise of the new Policy: the Committees objective for transparency with consistency between the b LTIP the Committee is introducing the following changes for the Companys reported results and the numbers used to calculate incentive payments to the executive directors.
This was the philosophy behind the clarification of the 2017 LTIP grant: methodology for EPS and ROIC used for the LTIP performance conditions.
In The introduction of a comparative total shareholder return performance addition, the Committee is aware of the negative shareholder sentiment around measure against the FTSE 250: adjustments to performance conditions for incentive outcomes.

In Part 3, on pages 72 - 78 we have included a summary of the existing policy.
When the revised Policy is put to shareholders, the Committee will set out the detailed rationale and reasons for the proposed changes.
Conclusion The Committee believes that the proposed changes summarised above are in I would like to thank again the shareholders who engaged with me during the year on the best interests of the Company.

2 The LTIP awards granted in 2014 will vest at 23.3% of the maximum.
3 The performance period for the 2014 LTIP award granted to the CFO was completed at the end of the 2016 financial year.
The level of vesting based on this performance would be 23.3 % which is 52,552 shares.
The third anniversary of the date of grant of his award is on 26 August 2017 due to the timing of his recruitment which resulted in a delay to his 2014 LTIP grant.
Following the CFO serving notice the Committee will determine whether the level of award capable of vesting as a result of the satisfaction of the performance conditions will vest based on the circumstances and performance of the CFO up to the date of his departure.
4 The Deferred Stock Plan awards that are expected to be granted in March 2017 are disclosed in the table above because the operating profit used to calculate the pool was over the three financial years ending 31 December 2014, 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 and the strategic objectives were measured at the end of 2016.
The details of these DSP awards are shown on page 64.
5 The Companys pension contribution for Simon Pryce and Mike Powell is 20% of basic salary.
During the year Simon Pryce and Mike Powell received a cash payment in lieu of a contribution to a pension scheme.
6 The disclosure in the Other column for 2016 represents payments made to Simon Pryce associated with his role as President of Flight Support and the need to spend significantly more time in the USA.
61 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Base salary for executive directors In December 2015, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries for the executive directors and their salaries were increased to reflect the increased scope, complexity and responsibilities of managing the enlarged Group: the challenges of effectively integrating the Landmark acquisition: and individual performance.
The base salary effective from 1 January 2016 for Simon Pryce was 660,750 and for Mike Powell was 420,000.
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors The fees for the Chairman and the non-executive directors are in the single figure table.
No change to the fee rates for the Chairman or non-executive directors were made for 2016.
Benefits Other benefits for the year for each executive director included a company car allowance, private medical insurance, death in service benefit, annual holiday, sick pay, an annual health check and gym membership.
The nature of the taxable benefits for the executive directors were unchanged compared to 2015.
Bonus The maximum bonus opportunity is 62.5% of salary for the executive directors split 52.5% of salary for financial performance 35% for operating profit and 17.5% for free cash flow and 10% of salary for personal objectives.
The whole bonus is paid in cash and there are no deferral obligations.
The choice of performance conditions and their respective weightings reflected the Committees belief that they would drive action to deliver exceptional sustainable value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.
In determining the bonus payment for 2016, no discretion was exercised by the Remuneration Committee in determining the bonus outcomes.
Following an assessment against the performance targets, the Committee concluded that Simon Pryce and Mike Powell will receive 70.6% and 70.1% respectively of their maximum bonus opportunity for 2016.
This equates to 34.1% of salary for the achievement against the financial objectives for both executives.
The 34.1% of salary for financial objectives is split 12.4% for free cash flow and 21.7% for operating profit.
Simon Pryce will receive 10% of his salary and Mike Powell will receive 9.7% of his salary for achievement of the personal strategic objectives.
This is illustrated below: 10% plus 52.5% 62.5% Opportunity 10% plus 34.1% 44.1% Simon Pryce 9.7% plus 34.1% 43.8% Mike Powell Personal objectives Financial objectives The Board has reviewed its practice and has decided to continue with its approach to disclose the Bonus targets for the year under review.
Financial measures account for 84% of the maximum opportunity.
The operating profit represents 56% of the maximum opportunity and free cash flow represents 28% of the maximum opportunity: of this free cash flow element, half was for the half-year position and the remaining half for the full-year position.
Personal objectives represent 16% of the maximum opportunity.
62 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Personal objectives In February 2017, the Remuneration Committee assessed each executive directors performance against the objectives that were set early in 2016 and concluded that Simon Pryce and Mike Powell had achieved 100% and 97% respectively of their personal objectives for 2016.
The objectives and the performance are summarised below: Simon Pryces personal objectives included financial targets in conjunction with the Landmark integration, strategic planning for all businesses with specific areas of focus for different businesses, setting five-year strategic VMV goals, portfolio optimisation and continuing development of senior leaders as part of the succession planning programme.
Mike Powells personal objectives included cash and covenant management, financial targets in conjunction with the Landmark integration, financial elements of the strategic planning process, a number of specific structural and organisational design matters and a number of projects linked to the Companys pension arrangements.
Financial objectives The graph below shows the financial objectives performance: Performance targets and achievement for 2016 Threshold Target Maximum $282.6m $314.0m $361.1m Operating profit 6.5% 15% 35% Percentage of salary payable $330.1m equalling a payment of 21.8% of salary Actual Performance $134.3m $149.2m $171.6m Free Cash Flow Full Year Percentage of salary payable 1.75% 3.75% 8.75% Actual Performance $148.1m equalling a payment of 3.6% of salary $7.3m $8.1m $9.3m Free Cash Flow Half Year Percentage of salary payable 1.75% 3.75% 8.75% Actual Performance $ 68.8 m equalling a payment of 8.75% of salary Maximum Threshold Target Notes The purpose of the half-year cash flow target is to focus attention on cash throughout the year rather than at a single point in time.
There is a trade creditor cap applied to the actual figures above, which ensures payments to creditors are not inappropriately delayed to deliver bonus targets.
The measures are assessed on a straight-line basis between threshold and target and also from target to maximum.
63 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Long-Term Incentive Awards Long-Term Incentive Plan The performance conditions for the LTIP awards granted in 2014 are set out in the table below.
Performance was measured over three financial years ending 31 December 2016.
Percentage of EPS growth per annum Average annual ROIC shares vesting 50% of each award 50% of each award Nil Less than 6% Below 10.5% 25% At 6% At 10.5% 25% to 100% straight line pro-rata Between 6% and 12% Between 10.5% and 12.0% 100% At or above 12% At or above 12.0% For the three years ended 31 December 2016: EPS growth per annum was 1.3% and the average annual ROIC was 10.93%.
Accordingly, the awards for the Executive Directors will vest at 23.3% of the maximum.
No discretion was exercised by the Remuneration Committee in determining the vesting.
LTIP Calculation Methodology Adjusted Earning Adjusted operating profit EPS ROIC Weighted average shares in issue Statutory invested capital Adjusted earnings In line with the formal IFRS calculation of EPS with two Adjusted operating profit: In line with the formal IFRS calculation of operating adjustments: 1 takes into account the Companys exceptional policy: and profit taking in to account the Companys exceptional policy.

Deferred Bonus Plan Half of the bonus in respect of 2013, paid in early 2014, was deferred for a period of three years.
The deferred bonus was converted into shares and will be released shortly after the third anniversary of the award.
As permitted by the rules of the scheme, the Remuneration Committee agreed that dividends will be awarded on the deferred element for the period of time after the risk of forfeiture had lifted.
The adjustment for dividends reflects the economic alignment of the directors interests with those of shareholders.
The Deferred Bonus is not included in the single figure table as it was included in the year it was earnt.
Deferred Stock Plan In 2015, the DSP was introduced for the executive directors and senior executives of the company.
Under the DSP, a pool of shares is determined based on 3.5% of BBA Aviations average Operating Profit performance over the prior three years and achievement against certain strategic objectives.
Participants are granted conditional shares which vest annually over a three year period but are not released until after the third anniversary of the grant.
The Group operating profit for 2014 was US$201.2m: for 2015 was US$202.0 million: and for 2016 was $330.1 million giving an average of US$244.4 million and 3.5% of this is US$8.5 million.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that 100% of the strategic objectives had been delivered and agreed the overall pool is therefore $8.5 million.
The strategic objectives were: Action plans on customer surveys prepared Q1 and actions undertaken Q4 Safety Management System and safety business plan formulated by business unit and site H2 : delivery achieved Q4 Bands 1-3 and other hi-potential staff to have personal objectives that require innovation tools to be applied to specific problems Formal design and launch of Signature ERO joint marketing programme and GM sales incentive scheme Situational Awareness training delivered to all banded employees Ethics Training updated and delivered to all 1500 relevant employees The face value of the DSP award that will be granted to Simon Pryce is equivalent to 72.5% of salary 493,415.
This award equates to 100% of the maximum for Simon Pryce.
The Remuneration Committee anticipates that it will grant this award in March 2017 and any awards made to executive directors will be announced via the Regulatory News Service RNS as soon as they are made, as well as in the 2017 Annual Report.
64 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Pension The Company made a cash payment equal to 20% of base salary in lieu of a contribution to a pension scheme for Simon Pryce and Mike Powell.
Other When Michael Scheeringa resigned in 2015, the Board asked Simon Pryce to take on the role of President of Flight Support in addition to his role as Group Chief Executive.
In order to fulfil these duties Simon Pryce was asked to spend significantly more of his time in the United States.
The Remuneration Committee agreed, in accordance with the Group Remuneration Policy, to provide accommodation for Simon Pryce while he is in America and an allowance to support his incidental living expenses.
The Committee agreed that the approach should be that Simon should be neither better off nor worse off as a result of the assignment and this meant certain elements have been grossed up for tax purposes.
There was no change in applicable bonus or long-term incentive structures, contract or underlying terms and conditions as a result of this.
It should be noted that there was no increase in the allowance in 2016.
The figure disclosed in 2015 represented the allowance from the start of the assignment to the end of the year.
In accordance with the approach described above and the policy, Simon Pryce received the following payments: Element Amount 000 Relocation and living expenses 120 Housing allowance 74 Total 194 Payments to past directors No payments have been made in 2016 to past directors in respect of their services as a director of the Company.
DBP shares were released to Mark Hoad, the former Group Finance Director, representing half of his bonus that was deferred in early 2013 in respect of 2012.
These shares were earned at the end of the deferral period.
Loss of office payments No directors received any payments for loss of office during the year.

Under normal circumstances, the linked award will only vest to the extent needed to provide sufficient funds to meet the exercise price of the approved share option.
The face value for both the linked award and the approved option are disclosed above the combined face value of these two awards is 29,999.

Change in remuneration of Chief Executive Officer and a comparator group The table below shows the movement in total remuneration for the CEO between the current and previous financial years compared with that of the total remuneration costs of relevant comparator employees as a whole.
Relevant employees are employees of BBA Aviation plc and its subsidiaries who are in banded grades 14 about 100 of the Groups senior leaders as the Board believes this is a suitable comparator group.
The CEOs reward is made up of a larger proportion of variable pay than employees within this comparator group.

Simon Pryce receives an annual fee of 50,000 for his role at Electrocomponents plc and Mike Powell receives an annual fee of 40,000 for his role at Low & Bonar plc.
Implementation of policy in 2017 The proposed implementation of the existing policy for each element of remuneration in 2017 is described below.
Base salary for executive directors The Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries of the executive directors in December 2016 and it was agreed that the base salary for Simon Pryce from 1 January 2017 would increase by 3% to 680,572.50.
Mike Powells base salary from 1 January 2017 would increase by 3% to 432,600.
The standard pay rise from 1 January 2017 for employees of good standing across the Group ranged from 2.5% to 5% and the average was 3%.
NED Fees The fees for the non-executive directors were reviewed in December 2016 and it was agreed to increase the standard fee and the Committee Chairmanship fees for the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee by 3%.
It was noted the Senior Independent Director fee was out of line with the market rate and it was agreed to increase the Senior Independent Director fee to 10,400.
The fees for the Chairman are due to be reviewed in December 2017.
66 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Pension and benefits The Committee does not expect to change the pension or benefit arrangements for the executive directors in 2017.
Annual cash bonus For 2017, the Committee has determined that the annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 62.5% of salary and will again be contingent on meeting both financial targets and personal objectives.
The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching and relevant to the Companys business strategy.
In 2017, financial performance objectives will again represent 84% of the bonus opportunity and personal objectives will represent 16% of the bonus opportunity.
The financial targets will, as in 2016 be based on operating profit and free cash flow at the half and full year with the same weights as in 2016.
The Board has decided that Bonus targets for 2017 are commercially sensitive as they could provide the market and competitors with confidential information on the Groups strategy and expectations.

Nick Land was a member of the Committee from the start of the year until his retirement at the AGM on 6 May 2016.
The Committee held five scheduled meetings and two additional meetings in 2016.
There was 100% attendance at all meetings during 2016.
The meetings were minuted by the Company Secretary.
Executive directors and the Group HR Director attend Remuneration Committee meetings by invitation.
The Committee is responsible for, among other things: determining remuneration strategy: determining the executive directors remuneration: determining the Chairmans remuneration: selecting performance measures and setting targets for the short-term and long-term incentive plans and performance-related share plans: reviewing proposals in respect of other senior executives: and overseeing any major changes in employee incentive structures throughout the Group.

Simon Pryce exceeded the expectation throughout the financial year and as at 31 December 2016 owned shares to the value of just under 900% of his salary.
The calculation includes shares held by Simon Pryce and his connected persons and, in accordance with the internal guidelines, conditional shares in the DBP and DSP.
New directors are expected to build up their holding to meet this expectation over time and as at 31 December 2016 although Mike Powell did not hold any shares in BBA Aviation plc, his interest in shares under the DBP and DSP was just over 150% of his salary.

The Directors Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 28 February 2017 and signed on its behalf by: Susan Kilsby Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 71 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Part 3: Summary of Directors Remuneration Policy In line with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2013, the full Directors Remuneration Policy has not been presented in this report given that the Policy was approved at the 2015 AGM and it is not intended to move a similar resolution again at the 2017 AGM.
However, to provide shareholders with an overview of our policy we have presented the following sections: Introduction Policy Table for executive directors Malus and Clawback Levels of remuneration under the policy assuming different performance outcomes for 2017 Recruitment and appointment policy Policy on payment for loss of office Change of control For the purpose of the Directors Remuneration Policy, scenario charts on page 76 have been updated using levels of remuneration under the Policy for 2017.
The full Directors Remuneration Policy, including the policy table for the Chairman and the non-executive directors together with the legacy plans, is available to view in full in the 2014 Annual Report on the Companys website at www.
Unexpired service contract information is shown above on page 67.
Introduction This section of the report describes BBA Aviations remuneration policy for directors.
The following key principles govern the design of the Groups remuneration and reward structures: relevance to BBA Aviation, the cyclicality of our businesses and the international markets in which we compete and operate: pay for performance, notably the effective execution of the Group strategy and delivery of exceptional, long-term sustainable value for all our shareholders and stakeholders: top quartile for exceptional performance and mid-market for mid-level performance: reward actions that support our Vision, Mission and Values: remuneration should be commensurate with role and responsibilities and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals with relevant experience: reward should be appropriate and easily understood, both internally and externally: for executive directors a significant element of remuneration should be aligned to long-term business performance: and the reward structure is compatible with our risk policies and systems and must not create environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The remuneration policy took effect following shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM.
All contractual commitments or awards made which are consistent with the remuneration policy in force at the time that the commitment or award was made will be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled or awards vest.
Any contractual commitments entered into or awards made before the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 came into force or before a person became a director will also be honoured.
The tables below set out a clear and comprehensive summary of BBA Aviations remuneration policy for directors and how it operates.
72 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Policy table for Executive Directors Base salary Strategic purpose Designed to attract individuals with the skills and capabilities to oversee the execution of the Groups strategy.
Set to reflect the role, the international nature of operations and the contribution, skills and experience of the individual.

Market comparisons are carried out every three years and are made against organisations of comparable size, complexity, geographical spread, business focus and opportunity.
Maximum opportunity The annual percentage salary increase will not normally exceed increases for employees across the Group as a whole with comparable levels of performance, except in certain exceptional circumstances such as: increase in scope, complexity or responsibilities of the role: salary progression for a newly appointed director: and market adjustment.
Link to performance Salary increases are linked to individual contribution and business performance which is assessed annually by the Remuneration Committee.

Bonus is delivered in cash.
Maximum opportunity The maximum annual cash bonus is 62.5% of salary.
Link to performance The level of bonus paid each year is determined by the Remuneration Committee after the year end based on performance against target.
Financial targets will normally account for not less than 70% of the potential maximum award, with personal objectives accounting for the remainder.
The Committee reviews the measures, the targets and the relevant weightings on an annual basis to ensure they remain appropriately aligned with the business strategy.
Examples of financial performance measures include operating profit and Group free cash flow.
Examples of personal objectives include achievement of specific strategic goals or KPIs.
Details of performance targets will be disclosed in the Annual Report covering the year that follows the end of the performance period subject to the Board being satisfied that they are no longer commercially sensitive.
Provisions for recovery of sums paid or Yes subject to the Groups malus and clawback policy.
withholding of sums Deferred Stock Plan Strategic purpose To strengthen the focus on delivering the Groups medium to long-term strategic goals and enhance the alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders.
The plan provides the individuals with an economic effect equivalent to annual bonus deferral.
Operation An award is made up of conditional shares that will be delivered based on the Companys operating profit, performance against strategic objectives and subject to continuing employment.
Under the rules of the plan the Remuneration Committee may make an award in respect of dividends that would have been received on the shares once the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
The Committee will operate the plan in accordance with the rules and in accordance with the principles of this remuneration policy.
Awards will be made annually and will vest over a three-year period.
The first awards are likely to be made in 2016.
Maximum opportunity The maximum opportunity under this plan is 72.5% of salary.
Link to performance Deferred stock will be allocated from a pool.
The pool will be calculated at the beginning of each year and the size of the pool will be the equivalent in value to 3.5% of the average Group operating profit over the prior three years.
The value of the pool will be converted into a number of shares based on the prevailing share price.
The proportion of the deferred stock pool available for allocation each year will be determined by the achievement of strategic Group objectives during the year.
These objectives will be set annually by the Remuneration Committee and aligned to medium and long-term goals that support the Groups objectives and focus on shareholder value creation.
The allocation of deferred stock to each individual will be based on potential and performance.
withholding of sums 74 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Long-term incentive plan Strategic purpose Focuses executives on achievement of longer-term strategic objectives and ensures long-term alignment with shareholders interests.
Operation Awards of shares are made on an annual basis and vest over a three-year period.

There is no vesting below threshold.
The Remuneration Committee will review the minimum vesting level and the weightings of performance metrics and the performance metrics themselves annually and retains the right to amend these weightings, metrics and measures as it thinks appropriate to effectively incentivise directors.
In the UK, the Executive Share Option Plan ESOP is used to grant options that are linked to the LTIP to allow directors to take advantage of HMRC-approved share options at no marginal cost to the Company.
Maximum opportunity Maximum annual award is 190% of salary.
Link to performance Financial performance is measured over three years and the performance measures are selected in accordance with the Groups key long-term strategic performance indicators.
Performance standards threshold and maximum will be reviewed by the Remuneration Committee in advance of each performance cycle.
Details of performance measures and targets are disclosed in the Annual Report.
withholding of sums Long-term incentive plan extended awards Strategic purpose Seeks to more closely align senior executives with the interests of shareholders and focus participants on creating shareholder value in line with the Groups growth aspirations by providing superior reward opportunity for delivering exceptional and stretch earnings growth above the base LTIP performance targets.
Operation The plan is long-term in nature with performance measured over a three-year period and awards vesting in years four and five normally being released at the end of the fifth year.
There is no vesting below threshold performance.

Maximum opportunity Subject to the relevant local tax limits.
Link to performance n a Notes 1 The performance measures selected for the purposes of the annual bonus plan and the long-term incentive plans are either KPIs for the Group or are selected in order to encourage and reward directly or indirectly sustainable and long-term shareholder value creation.
Performance targets are set taking into account prior year performance, annual budgets, strategic imperatives and external factors.
Threshold performance is set taking into account the highly cyclical nature of our business and the variability of results from year to year and our dependence on flying hours.
The maximum standard of performance is intended to be exacting and to represent a level of performance that places the Group among the best performers.
2 The elements of remuneration for executive directors are similar to those that apply to the management-banded population in the Group.
Any differences that exist arise either because of market practice and or the Remuneration Committees assessment of business need and commercial necessity.
3 The Company also reimburses business expenses in accordance with the corporate business expenses policy which the Remuneration Committee has discretion to revise from time to time.
4 In addition to other benefits, the Remuneration Committee, where necessary, will provide support in accordance with BBA Aviations standard approach to relocation where a director is required to relocate to fulfil their responsibilities.
The primary purpose of the policy is to facilitate recruitment and relocation of key employees by protecting the individual and their family from costs arising directly from a move of residence required for business reasons.
The elements of the policy include, but are not limited to, travel reimbursement of the cost of movement of household goods, housing, schooling and other reasonable costs.
75 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Policy tables for Chairman and non-executive directors See 2014 Annual Report and Accounts on the Company website www.
com Malus and clawback policy The table below sets out the scope and circumstances under whic h withholding malus and recovery of pay clawback will be applied to variable pay of the executive directors.
The same provisions also apply to the senior staff in Bands 14 circa 100 employees.
Clawback triggers Malus triggers fraud where proven personally culpable: or as clawback: or gross misconduct.
material misstatement in, or adverse impact on, published accounts or financial Time limit: Two years from vesting.
accounts of the relevant entity: or error in information or assessment of performance target or measures.
Time limit: Until the award vests.
If a trigger event does occur, the Remuneration Committee will apply the malus and or clawback policy fairly, taking account of all relevant circumstances, including the degree of personal culpability.
Levels of remuneration under the policy assuming different performance outcomes for 2017 This information has been updated to show 2017 figures rather than the 2015 figures that were used when the policy was approved by shareholders.
For maximum performance the chart shows that, for the Chief Executive, 73% of reward is performance related and 59% is linked to longer-term performance.
For mid-point performance the chart shows that, for the Chief Executive, 57% of reward is performance related and 46% is linked to longer-term performance.
Simon Pryce 27% 14% 59% Maximum 3,049,548 43% 11% 46% Mid-point 1,943,617 100% Minimum 837,687 0 | 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 1,500,000 | 2,000,000 | 2,500,000 | 3,000,000 | 3,500,000 | Fixed pay Annual bonus Long-term incentives For the purposes of this analysis the following assumptions have been made: Fixed elements comprise base salary and other benefits.
Base Salary and benefits and pension reflect the increases approved in December 2016 to apply in 2017.
For mid-point performance, an assumption of 50% of annual bonus and DSP is applied and 50% vesting for the LTIP has also been used.
Housing and relocation are excluded.
76 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report Recruitment and appointment policy This recruitment and appointment policy will apply if any of the following are appointed to the Board: an external candidate: an internal candidate: a non-executive director being appointed as Chairman or to an executive role: or an executive director being promoted.
All of the components in the existing policy would be considered in developing an appropriate remuneration package in accordance with the principles set out on page 72 and taking into account the following additional considerations: a full range of factors including, but not limited to, the calibre of candidate, the level of existing remuneration, the jurisdiction the candidate is recruited from and into, and the individuals skills and experience: internal relativities and appropriate market comparisons: any awards or payments made in consideration for remuneration that may be foregone by an external candidate will generally be share-based and subject to forfeiture if the executive leaves within a set period after the appointment: and the value assigned to any remuneration that may be foregone will take into account factors such as the vesting period and the probability of shares vesting and will be based on objective valuation methodologies.
As far as possible, the remuneration of new directors will be set in accordance with the existing directors remuneration policy: however, the Committee retains discretion to: use the current Listing Rule 9.4.
2R, or any other existing share scheme operating at the relevant time if required, in order to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of a director but any arrangements of this kind will not in aggregate exceed 400% of salary or any lower limit in the relevant schemes : and agree contract terms to reflect local market norms but will generally seek to apply the current policy in respect of contracts of employment and Corporate Governance guidelines.
Policy on payment for loss of office In the event of termination of an executive directors contract, the Company will comply with any applicable legislative or regulatory framework and will honour contractual commitments that have been made.
The Company will seek to avoid making any payment for failure.
The Company takes into account the circumstances of termination and seeks to strike an appropriate balance, considering all relevant matters, that it believes are in the best interests of shareholders.
In certain circumstances the executive directors may receive compensation on early termination of a contract which could amount to up to one years base salary, benefits in kind and pension rights.
The contracts allow for phased payments to be made on termination and include an obligation on the former director to mitigate loss.
This mechanism of phased payments allows for the amount of any phased payments to be reduced in circumstances where the former director secures a position during the period of phased payments.
A director who leaves as a result of poor personal performance will normally be treated differently than a director who leaves by reason of redundancy, retirement or ill health.
The Company will not make any payments for loss of office in the event of gross misconduct.
The Remuneration Committee will operate the share schemes in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the principles of the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to reach agreement with departing directors and approve additional payments in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment where such payment is in the interests of shareholders including the settlement or compromise of any claim or threatened claim.
There is no contractual obligation to pay a bonus which has not been superseded by the bonus rules and there is no entitlement to any bonus payments if an employee is under notice given or received at the end of the applicable financial year, although it is within the discretion of the Committee to award a bonus, subject to the limits set out in the policy.
On termination, a non-executive director would normally receive their fee for the month of termination.
The Chairman is entitled to six months notice and benefits for that period if served notice by the Company.
The Company may purchase a small token leaving gift for departing directors.
77 Directors Report Directors Remuneration Report The table below sets out how each component of the payment may be calculated.
Element o f payment Basis of calculation Annual base salary Calculated on a contractual basis.
Pension and other benefits Calculated on a contractual basis and where the pay in lieu of notice clause is invoked, an amount up to one years accrued benefits.
The Committee also makes modest payments relating to outplacements.
Annual incentive No bonus is paid in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
Ordinarily, individuals are entitled to a bonus only when reasons for leaving include, but not limited to, retirement, death, ill health, redundancy, or sale of an employing entity.
However the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to pay a bonus depending on the exact circumstances of the termination.
The bonus is not included in the calculation of any payment in lieu of notice.
The bonus is calculated in accordance with the rules of the plan.
Long-term incentives On a contractual basis and in accordance with the scheme rules.
Unvested shares lapse under the LTIP and the ELTIP on termination unless it is for a permitted reason ill health, redundancy, etc.
or the Remuneration Committee makes use of the discretion under the rules of the plan to allow the shares to vest.
Any vesting is subject to the substitution of performance targets and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, through pro-rating to reflect the date of termination, relative to the performance periods of the outstanding shares.
Deferred shares under the annual bonus plan and awards under the Deferred Stock Plan may or may not be forfeitable depending on the timing of the termination in the deferral periods.
Unvested shares may be awarded on termination for a permitted reason e. g. ill health, redundancy, etc.
or at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and will usually be subject to appropriate pro-rating.
Any matching award under the deferred bonus plan will vest subject to performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, be pro-rated for the period served as a director during the performance period at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The contracts of the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director preclude any right to other compensation for any loss of any share-based pay beyond the rules of the schemes.
Compensation for forfeited Upon termination, any buy-out awards would normally lapse.
However, the Remuneration Committee does retain the discretion to remuneration decide otherwise, provided the termination is not as a result of poor performance.
Other benefits, Will depend on what has been agreed on appointment, but the Remuneration Committee would not expect any or all of these elements e. g. relocation allowances, of pay to form part of any termination arrangement but has discretion to make payments in respect of them.
international mobility benefits and expenses All employee equity Directors will be treated in the same manner as any other member of staff in respect of those plans.
participation plans Change of control In the event of a change of control, the Remuneration Committee will determine the extent to which any unvested shares under all plans will vest, taking into account all relevant factors including the performance criteria and the time elapsed since the date of grant.
Directors will be entitled to receive their conditional shares from the deferred bonus or Deferred Stock Plan where the risk of forfeiture has lifted.
