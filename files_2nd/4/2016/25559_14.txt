Under the co-investment arrangements, executive directors make minority capital and loan commitments to IP Venture Fund IPVF alongside the Group.
Executives are entitled to participate in a carried interest scheme in respect of IPVF and The North East Technology Fund LP alongside the Group.
Carried interest provides a preferential return to participants once the partnership in question has returned all funds contributed by limited partners together with a pre-agreed rate of return.
The carried interest and co-investment arrangements will generally contain forfeiture provisions in respect of leavers over the investment period of the relevant partnership typically 5-6 years.
As described in the Policy, no new allocations of this kind will be made to executive directors in future however the current outstanding interests in co-investment and carried interest schemes in connection with the Groups managed funds are as follows: IPVF co-investment arrangements The Executive Directors commitments to, and returns from, IPVF are set out below.

Under the IPVF fund LPA, payments to participants are made when all limited partners have been repaid their contributions together with a hurdle rate of 8% compound interest.
Under the North East Technology Fund NETF scheme, payments to participants are made when all limited partners have been repaid their contributions together with a hurdle rate of 3.5% compound interest.
Scheme interest represents the percentage of the relevant pool of investments in respect of which the participant is entitled to participate in the realised profits assuming the relevant hurdle return has been met.
The schemes contain forfeiture provisions over the investment period of the fund which may reduce the scheme interest accruing to any participant.
The table reflects the maximum scheme interest receivable should no forfeiture occur.
Accrued value of scheme interests is calculated based upon the current fair value of the relevant limited partnerships assets in excess of the capital contributed and the hurdle rate of return.
Any payments will only be made following full repayment of limited partners loan commitments and the hurdle return and accordingly actual payments under the scheme, if any, may be materially different to those set out above.

As part of the arrangements for the acquisition of Fusion IP plc, Mr Baynes Fusion IP LTIP awards were converted into awards over IP Group shares at the same conversion price per share as the scheme of arrangement was undertaken 0.446 IP Group plc shares for every Fusion IP plc share.
The awards will vest on 31 December 2017 provided certain performance conditions are met which relate to, inter alia, the growth in value of Fusion IP plcs net asset value Fusion NAV from the date of acquisition and the continued employment of the individual by the Group.
In summary, if Fusion NAV growth of 10% per annum is achieved then 30% of an award shall vest.
Maximum vesting will occur if Fusion NAV growth of 20% per annum is achieved with straight-line vesting between 30 and 100% if Fusion NAV growth of 10%-20% per annum is achieved.
No vesting shall occur if Fusion NAV growth of less than 10% is achieved.

Where an executive director accepts an appointment to the board of a company in which the Group is a shareholder, the Group generally retains the related fees.
In the circumstances where the executive director receives such fees directly, such sums are generally deducted from their base salary from the Group.
Fees earned for directorships of companies in which the Group does not have a shareholding are normally retained by the relevant director.
Any outside appointments i. e. excluding those companies in which the Group is a shareholder held by executive directors are set out on pages 52 and 53.
Limits on the number of shares used to satisfy share awards dilution limits All of the Groups incentive schemes that contain an element that may be satisfied in IP Group shares incorporate provisions that in any ten-year period ending on the relevant date of grant, the maximum number of the Shares that may be issued or issuable under all such schemes shall not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time.
