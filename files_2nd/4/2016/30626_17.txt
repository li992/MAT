More detail can be found in the Annual report on remuneration.
Our principles of remuneration There should be a strong link between an individuals reward and the performance of the Group to align the interests of Senior Management with those of shareholders.
Variable remuneration makes up a significant proportion of the remuneration package.
Stretching performance conditions directly aligned with Group strategy.
The Groups strategy is laid out on pages 14 to 15.
The Groups mission isto be the most useful resource for consumers when finding, moving or managing their home and the most effective partner for related businesses.

Remuneration Policy The Committee determines the Policy for the Executive Directors, the Chairman and other Senior Management for current and future years and this is reviewed on an annual basis.
The Policy is designed to support the strategic objectives of the Group and to allow the business to recruit, retain and incentivise the quality of Senior Management needed to shape and execute our strategy to deliver sustained shareholder value over the long term.
The Policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors, Senior Management and employees to the long-term interests of shareholders and aims to support a high performance culture with appropriate reward for superior performance, without creating incentives that will encourage excessive risk taking or unsustainable performance.
The Committee considers that a successful policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Groups business environment and in remuneration practice.
The Committee is satisfied that its approach to the Executive Directors remuneration is designed to promote the long-term success of the Group.
56|The consumer champion at the heart of the home Corporate governance The Remuneration Committee will review annually the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and key Senior Management drawing on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Group and taking into consideration the: business strategy over the period: overall corporate performance: market conditions affecting the Group: changing practice in the markets where the Group competes for talent: and changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Statement of conditions elsewhere in the Group The remuneration policy for all employees is determined in terms of best practice and ensuring that the Group is able to attract and retain thebest people.
This principle is followed in the development of our Policy.
However, employee views are not specifically sought in determining this Policy.
The Group does not currently use any remuneration comparison metrics.
Salary and benefit packages are linked to both individual and business performance.
All employees participate in bonus plans which, together with salary reviews linked to business performance, enable all employees to share in the success of the Group.
All employees are eligible toparticipate in the SIP.

The increase for the CEO was made as part of the annual review in line with the budgeted Benefits average increase for employees of 5% and an increase to reflect the enlarged scope and complexity of the business following the Property Software Group acquisition.
The increase for the CFO reflects an adjustment as part of the annual Pension review in line with employees and an increase in line with our Policy fornew recruits, which is to bring the salary level in line with target policy as they become established in the role.
The increase for the CFO is measured from the annualised salary of 250,000 effective at the date of appointment on18April 2016.
The new salaries remain below the median levels for the roles in the FTSE 250.
There are no proposed changes to benefits and pensions from the financial year ending 30 September 2016.

The bonus which can be earned for target performance is 60% of the maximum bonus for the CEO.
The maximum bonus opportunity for the CFO has been increased from 100% to 125% of salary as part of the structure implemented for the new CFO, details and rationale outlined on page 57 with the target performance reducing from 75% to 60% to align with the CEO bonus programme.
Operation of the plan: 50% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash: and 50% of any bonus earned will be paid in shares which vest after a further three years subject to the Executive Directors continued employment.
Performance conditions for the 2017 financial year and their weighting are as follows: EBITDA 50% : revenue 30% : and personal strategic objectives 20%.
The details of the targets applicable to the bonus for the coming year are considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive as they are the key metrics that are critical to the operation of the Company, so they have not been disclosed as the Committee feels it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to do so.
The Committee will provide full retrospective disclosure of the performance targets for the financial measures to allow shareholders to judge the bonus earned in the context of the performance delivered.
The Committee believes that some of the personal objectives may continue to remain commercially sensitive.
The outcomes of the 2016 bonus are provided on page 65.
The CEO is not granted awards under the LTIP, since the introduction of the VCP below on 1 October 2015.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The maximum opportunity for the CFO has increased to 150% from 125% of salary as part of the structure implemented for the new CFO, details and rationale outlined on page 58 which he will be granted in respect of this award cycle.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the EPS target range for LTIP awards to be granted in 2017.
It is the Committees view that the threshold level of EPS growth at 10% compound average growth rate remains appropriate.
However, it is expected that the EPS growth rate will naturally slow as a result of the increased scale of the business following the recent acquisitions and the different earnings models within these businesses.
In order to ensure alignment with the Companys business plan the Committee feels that the stretch EPS range should be reduced from 25% to 18% compound average growth rate.
This level remains materially in excess of analysts expectations over the period and is consistent with our performance focused remuneration policy.
The vesting earned at threshold performance has been maintained at 25%.
There are no changes to the TSR performance targets.
The VCP for the current CEO will enter its second year since approval by shareholders on 1 October 2015.
