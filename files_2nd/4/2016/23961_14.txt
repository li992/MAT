Directors remuneration report Approach to remuneration Statement by Chair of the The Groups strategic objectives as set out in the Strategic Report are:  driving growth through attractive commercial propositions in our passenger revenue businesses: continuous improvement in operating and financial performance: prudent investment in our key assets fleets, systems and people : focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses: and maintaining responsible partnerships with our customers and communities.
The Committee believes that achievement against these objectives, which underpin the transformation plans and medium term targets that Dear fellow shareholder have been communicated to shareholders, will deliver strong long term Overview financial performance and shareholder value on a sustainable basis.
Last year shareholders voted to approve our new Directors Remuneration Policy.
Although the approved remuneration policy Remuneration philosophy isnotsubject to a shareholder vote this year, we have reprinted it on The key principles underpinning the Committees approach pages 91 to 100 for ease of reference, so as to assist shareholders toexecutive remuneration are: inreviewing the implementation of the policy over the past year.

This was below the threshold level for the adjusted operating profit element of the annual bonus.

Performance-related pay The Committee believes it is important that for Executive Directors a significant proportion of the remuneration package is performance-related and the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Companys strategy and transformation plans.
The Committee considers performance against a range of metrics to ensure that the assessment is rounded, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative factors.
The table below outlines each of the performance measures used in the Companys 2016 17 performance-related incentives and how they support the Companys strategy, transformation plans and business objectives as outlined in the Strategic Review.

Within each element the Committee considered a number of sub-elements, including the performance of each division and the Companys performance on a rail and non-rail basis, and formed a rounded assessment of performance of the Executive Directors at the end ofthe year.

A strong performance from First Rail, underpinned by good passenger volume growth and operating performance, was offset by the more challenging market environment faced by the other divisions.
Assessment of 0% relative to a target outcome of 39% and a maximum outcome of 65%.
Group cash flow Actual performance was slightly above target level of performance of 34.2m.
Lower EBITDA and proceeds on the disposal of property, plant and equipment were offset by a better capital expenditure and working capital performance.

Customer satisfaction A good performance from Greyhound was offset by below threshold performances from the other divisions.
Assessment of 0.9% relative to a target outcome of 3.75% and a maximum outcome of 7.5%.
Individual performance The Committee carefully reviewed the performance of Tim OToole, Matthew Gregory and Chris Surch against objectives set at the beginning of the year date of appointment for Matthew Gregory.
Tim OTooles objectives related to supporting the long term growth of the Group through strategic leadership, delivery of the transformation plans, developing new business opportunities, including ensuring disciplined and successful rail bidding, and developing robust talent management and succession planning processes.
The Committee concluded that Tim OToole had shown good leadership and sound judgement in pursuing the long term sustainability of the Group, and had met the vast majority of his objectives.
Matthew Gregorys objectives related to developing constructive working relationships with the Board and divisional and functional managers, developing a clear understanding of the key business drivers and risks of the divisions, and identifying key areas of cost control and efficiency.
The Committee confirmed that since being appointed as Chief Financial Officer on 1 December 2015 his financial stewardship of the Group had been excellent, and his objectives had been substantially achieved or exceeded.
Chris Surchs objectives, which were assessed up to 1 December 2015, related to cost savings, corporate finance initiatives and support for the divisions in achieving their financial objectives.
The Committee judged that he had met the majority of his objectives.
Assessments of 7%, 9% and 6% were made for Tim OToole, Matthew Gregory and Chris Surch, respectively, relative to a target outcome of 5% and a maximum outcome of 10%.
2016 17 Executive Directors annual bonus awards The Committee took the opportunity during the year to review the performance metrics and targets for the executive annual bonus plan.
Asaresult, some changes have been made to the 2016 17 awards to ensure that the metrics and targets used continue to align with the Groupsbusiness strategy.
For 2016 17 the executive annual bonus plan will incentivise improved performance against a range of financial and non-financial metrics.
Thestructure of the bonus will be weighted such that 75% will be based on financial metrics, including the introduction of a revenue metric alongside Group operating profit and Group cash flow metrics, and 25% on non-financial metrics.
The financial targets set by the Committee arestretching against budgeted performance to ensure payouts only occur for strong performance over the financial year.
A summary of the structure is provided in the table overleaf.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 77 Directors remuneration report continued Measure Financial Weighting Group operating profit 45% Revenue growth 20% Cash generation 10% Non-financial Safety 7.5% Customer service 7.5% Individual performance 10% Specific targets will not be disclosed in advance as they would give a clear indication of the Groups business objectives, which are commercially sensitive.
Where bonus targets are no longer commercially sensitive, typically following the end of the financial year, they will be disclosed in that years Directors Remuneration Report.
Awards are subject to an underlying performance override enabling them to be scaled back to reflect the Groups performance as well as malus and clawback.
Half of any bonus earned will be deferred into the Companys shares for three years, conditional upon continued employment.
The 2016 17 annual bonus maximum and threshold levels of bonus as a percentage of base salary are as follows: Executive Director Maximum Threshold Tim OToole 120% 0% Matthew Gregory 150% 0% Long Term Incentive Plan 2015 Long Term Incentive Awards audited As set out in the 2015 Chair of the Remuneration Committees letter to shareholders, the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Companys LTIP arrangements in 2015.
This included consultations with major investors and their representative bodies on the inclusion of an additional returns-based metric ROCE as well as the definitions, weightings and target levels of performance of the LTIP metrics.
ROCE was proposed as a measure as it reflects the returns generated for shareholders and measures the efficiency of capital use.
Following input from the new Chairman, Wolfhart Hauser, and feedback from major investors in response to a detailed consultation letter sent inOctober 2015, who were supportive of the overall LTIP approach, the Committee made a number of amendments to the structure of the LTIP, with ROCE replacing EPS as a metric alongside TSR.
Half of the award is subject to the achievement of stretching ROCE target figures determined at the end of the performance period and the remaining half of the award is subject to the Companys relative TSR.
Awards are subject to a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period as well as malus and clawback.
In addition, before an award vests the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying performance of the Group is satisfactory.
The Committee believes that having aperformance override is an important feature of the plan as it mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes.
Details of the performance metrics and targets for the 2015 LTIP awards, which were delayed until December 2015 to ensure the outcome of the above consultations were appropriately reflected, are set out below.
ROCE a key KPI used in managing the business as it captures both growth in earnings and the efficient allocation of limited capital.
Calculated by dividing adjusted operating profit after tax by net assets excluding cash and debit items.
To reflect those items outside of managements control, the definition of ROCE will be adjusted for: use of constant currency the use of constant currency is established practice at FirstGroup and ensures that management are rewarded for improving the underlying performance of the business.
LTIP targets are based on estimated foreign exchange rates in line with those rates included in the Groups 3-Year Plan, which is updated annually.
The principal foreign exchange assumptions will be provided for each award: exclusion of pension deficit the exclusion of the pension deficit is considered appropriate as the Committee believes management should not be rewarded for movements in this element: and exclusion of non-continuing rail franchises First Rail franchises that are not contracted to be operated for the full duration of the LTIP performance period are excluded from the ROCE calculation of that LTIP award.
Winning a franchise or being awarded an extension to an existing franchise a Direct Award within a performance period will lead to that franchise being included in subsequent LTIP awards, but not being included in the calculation of existing awards.
This ensures a like-for-like comparison across the performance period.
Due to the way in which rail franchises are included, an appropriate ROCE target range will be determined in respect of each LTIP award.
In order to provide transparency for each LTIP award, the Committee will disclose both the ROCE target range percentages and also the equivalent EPS CAGR percentages.
78 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance The Committee believes that this method of calculation results in a ROCE definition which will ensure management are rewarded for improving the effective allocation of capital across the business and then generating a return from this investment.
Details of the ROCE targets for the 2015 LTIP are set out below: Equivalent % of award ROCE EPS CAGR which vests 7.6% 17% 0% 7.6% 17% 12.5% 8.7% 26% 50% 1 Between 12.5% and 50% of the award will vest on a straight-line basis if ROCE at the end of the performance period is between 7.6% and 8.7%.
2 The adjustments referred to above result in a re-statement of the 2014 15 reported ROCE from 7.8% to 6.2% based on the 2015-2018 3-Year Plan currency assumption of $1.55:1.
Excluding the pension deficit increases capital employed by 239.4m while adjusting for non-continuing rail franchises and constant currency reduces post-tax operating profit by 35.1m and capital employed by 44.0m.
Taken together, these adjustments reduce adjusted operating profit after tax in 2014 15 to 201.7m and increases capital employed to 3,239.1m, or aROCE of 6.2%.
The proposed target range of 7.6% to 8.7% clearly represents a significant challenge for management in respect of the achievement of both threshold and stretch targets against this baseline.
3 Equivalent EPS CAGR assumes interest charges, effective tax rate and capital employed assumptions are held in line with the 2015-2018 3-Year Plan projections for the year ended 31 March 2018.
Relative TSR reflects actual returns delivered to shareholders.
The relative nature of the metric, with TSR measured against a comparator group of 32 companies, creates an objective measure of long term value delivery to shareholders and rewards executives for delivering performance which is better than that of competitors.
Relative TSR will be determined over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 April 2015 using a three month average TSR at thebeginning and end of the performance period by reference to the Companys positioning amongst a comparator group of companies.
The Committee believes that relative TSR is a suitable value metric, which takes into account performance of the Companys closest peers.
Details of the TSR targets for the 2015 LTIP are set out below: % of award TSR Ranking which vests Below median 0% Median 12.5% Upper quartile 50% 1 Between median and the upper quartile of the peer group, vesting will be on a straight-line basis between 12.5% and 50%.
The comparator group for the benchmarking of remuneration and the relative TSR metric for awards granted in 2015 comprises: Aggreko Carnival Grafton Group Serco Group Amec Foster Wheeler DCC Hays SIG Atkins WS easyJet Interserve Smith DS Babcock International Group Electrocomponents Kier Group Stagecoach Group Balfour Beatty G4S Mitie Group Thomas Cook Group Bunzl Galliford Try National Express Travis Perkins Capita GKN Regus Wolseley Carillion Go-Ahead Group Rentokil Initial Wood Group John The comparator group comprises companies in the travel, business services and industrial sectors, which are of comparable scale, complexity and activity to FirstGroup.
In the event of one or more of the constituents undergoing a takeover, merger, dissolution, variation in capital or anyother event that will materially affect the calculation of a ranking, the Committee shall determine how this should be reflected in the rankingcalculation.
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest on a pro rata basis by reference to the length of time since the award was granted, and only if the performance conditions can effectively be regarded as having been satisfied at that time, although the Committee may decide not to pro rata an award if it is inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.

80 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance 2016 Long Term Incentive Awards The structure of LTIP awards to be granted in 2016 will remain the same as for the 2015 awards, with half of the award subject to ROCE growth and the remaining half of the award subject to the Companys relative TSR.
Awards will be subject to a two-year holding period following the three-year performance period as well as malus and clawback.
On this basis, awards will be granted in June 2016 to the Executive Directors as follows: Minimum threshold Maximum Face value performance performance Performance % of base salary % of maximum potential % of maximum potential period Tim OToole 120 25% 100% 1.4.

Excluding the pension deficit increases capital employed by 270.9m while adjusting for non-continuing rail franchises and constant currency reduces post-tax operating profit by 8.3m and capital employed by 180.2m.
Taken together, these adjustments reduce adjusted operating profit after tax in 2015 16 to 223.2m and increases capital employed to3,289.5m, or a ROCE of 6.8%.

In setting the ROCE targets for the 2016 LTIP the Committee took into account the revised outlook for oil prices since the 2015 LTIP ROCE targets were set, and the corresponding impact on earnings.
The Committee believes that given this revised outlook, retaining the ROCE targets at the same level as those set for the 2015 LTIP continues to provide a significant challenge at both threshold and stretch targets.

82 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance Shareholding guidelines audited Under the terms of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, Executive Directors are required tobuild up a specified shareholding in the Company.
This is to create greater alignment of the Executive Directors interests with those of shareholders.
The guidelines require Executive Directors to retain at least 75% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under a Group share incentive plan or otherwise acquire shares in the Company within a five-year period from the later of their date of appointment or the date of approval of thecurrent remuneration policy, 16 July 2015, until a shareholding with a market value calculated by reference to the year-end share price equalto 200% of base salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 150% of base salary in the case of other Executive Directors is achieved.
TheCommittee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of such guidelines in certain circumstances, including the impending retirement ofan ExecutiveDirector.
The table below sets out the Executive Directors and their connected persons shareholdings including beneficial interests and a summary of outstanding and unvested share awards as at 31 March 2016.

3 In the period 1 April to 14 June 2016, Tim OToole acquired 15,350 shares in the Company, increasing his shareholding to 864,720 shares.
No other changes inExecutive Director interests occurred in the period.
4 Chris Surch beneficially owned 76,335 ordinary shares as at 1 April 2015 and 1 December 2015 the date he retired as a Director.
Since June 2015, Tim OToole has allocated 15,000 of his gross monthly base salary equivalent to over 20% of his base salary to acquire shares in the Company, with shares being purchased from the post-tax and post-NI amount.
Matthew Gregory intends to exercise his vested share awards shortly after the announcement of the Groups 2015 16 preliminary results.
He will retain all the shares upon exercise, except those shares required to be sold to cover the tax liability.
All-employee share schemes Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Companys Sharesave SAYE and Share Incentive Plan BAYE on the same terms as other eligible employees.
SAYE The maximum participation level in the SAYE plan is 500 per calendar month with participants granted linked share options, by reference toprojected savings, with a strike price up to a 20% discount to the prevailing share price at the time of grant.
On the maturity of the savings contracts, participants can elect to use the accumulated savings to exercise the option or request the return of their savings.
BAYE The maximum participation level in the BAYE is as per HMRC limits and provides for a combination of the following: free shares the Company can give each participant free shares worth up to 3,600 each: partnership shares participants can use up to 1,800 per year out of pre-tax and pre-NI pay to buy partnership shares: matching shares the Company can give matching shares at a ratio of up to two matching shares for each partnership share bought by theemployee: and dividend shares participants can use up to 1,800 of dividends from plan shares each year to buy further shares in the Company through theplan.
At present the Company provides two matching shares for every three partnership shares, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 a month and any dividend shares.
No free shares are provided.
The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in whichcase no income tax or NI will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed fromtrust within three years from award.
In accordance with the applicable legislation shares that remain subject to the plan are held on behalf of participants in a UK-based trust.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 83 Directors remuneration report continued Preventing rewards for failure In respect of awards made under the EABP and LTIP, from 2015 onwards, in the event of a triggering event, such as a material mis-statement of accounts, gross misconduct or computational error, the Company will have the ability to clawback awards.
For the EABP, annual cash bonuses may be clawed back at any time up to the end of the third financial year after that in respect of which the payment is made and share awards will remain subject to clawback for three years following the date of grant.
For the LTIP, awards will remain subject to clawback for two years following the end of the three-year performance period.
In addition, prior to the vesting of awards made under the EABP and LTIP, in respect of awards made from 2014 onwards, the Committee may reduce awards to reflect any triggering event, such as material mis-statement of accounts or gross misconduct.
Dilution The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Companys share plans and the means of satisfying such awards remains within best practice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital for all share plans and 5% in respect of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling period.
The Committee monitors dilution levels at least once a year.
At31March 2016, 3.7% of the Companys issued share capital had been allocated for the purposes of its share incentive plans over a ten-year period, including 2.0% in respect of the LTIP.
Employee Benefit Trust The FirstGroup Employee Benefit Trust has been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from fundsprovided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise or vesting of awards under the Groups share-based incentive plans.
The trustee of the FirstGroup Employee Benefit Trust has informed the Company that its intention is to abstain from voting in respect of theFirstGroup shares held in the trust.
As at 31 March 2016, 545,083 shares were held by the Employee Benefit Trust to hedge outstanding awards of 53,515,600.
This means that the trust holds sufficient shares to satisfy 1.0% of outstanding awards.
Departure terms of Chris Surch audited Chris Surch retired from the Board on 1 December 2015 and ceased employment on 8 January 2016.
The Committee considered the overall circumstances of his departure as well as performance, contractual obligations and plan rules.
In particular, the Committee considered his sustained performance and contribution to the Company over his three years of service.
The Committees determinations, which are consistent with the remuneration policy, are set out below: Remuneration element Description Payment in lieu No payment in respect of salary or benefits or compensation in lieu in respect of any period after 8 January 2016 or ofnotice compensation for loss of office was made.
Base salary No 2015 16 base salary increase was awarded given his scheduled departure date.
Annual bonus Given the circumstances and timing of his departure, the Committee determined that it would be appropriate for Chris Surch to receive a bonus in respect of the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
The amount of bonus would be reduced in proportion to reflect only that part of the financial year in which he was actively employed and would be paid at the time annual bonus awards are normally made in respect of the financial year ending 31 March 2016.
Accordingly, he will be paid a pro rated cash bonus of 44,834, in line with the bonus outturn of 14.9%.
Details of the 2015 16 bonus outturn are set out on page 76.
Pension benefits No pension benefits were made to Chris Surch in respect of any period after 8 January 2016 and no additional amounts were paid for loss of office.
Deferred share Those amounts of Chris Surchs annual bonus from previous years that were compulsorily deferred into shares will vest in awards accordance with the good leaver provisions of the plan rules at the end of the relevant three year vesting period as set out in the table below: Number of 1 Award deferred shares Estimated value Vesting date 2013 deferred bonus award 73,875 76,386 1.4.

Recruitment remuneration for Matthew Gregory audited Matthew Gregorys remuneration package comprises a basic salary of 425,000, benefits, a pension allowance of 20% of base salary and eligibility to participate in the Groups annual bonus plan up to a maximum of 150% of base salary per annum and in the LTIP up to a maximum of175% of base salary per annum, which are entirely in line with the approved remuneration policy.
Matthew Gregory has a service contract which requires 12 months notice of termination by him and 12 months notice by the Company.
Matthew Gregory held a number of share incentives under various incentive plans operated by his previous employer, Essentra plc.
In line with the approved remuneration policy, replacement awards formed part of his recruitment remuneration.
Replacement awards were structured to reflect what the Committee considered to be a fair estimate of the remuneration forfeited by Matthew Gregory.
The majority of the replacement awards were made under FirstGroups existing LTIP, using the maximum available award of 300% of salary.
These awards are subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions and will vest, subject to performance in 2018.
This approach brings the replacement award more immediately into line with the interests of FirstGroups shareholders.
Performance conditions which apply to the award are the same as those for other LTIP awards granted to executives in 2015, details of which are set out on pages 78 to 80.
In addition to the above awards, Matthew Gregory was awarded deferred shares under FirstGroups Executive Annual Bonus Plan.
The awards granted on 17 December 2015 under the Executive Annual Bonus Plan replaced awards made to Matthew Gregory under the Essentra Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan, which were forfeited as a result of his resignation from Essentra.
A further award was made on 24 March 2016 under FirstGroups Executive Annual Bonus Plan in respect of compensation for the value of Matthew Gregorys 2013 award forfeited under the Essentra Long Term Incentive Plan which would have vested in March 2016.
As agreed with him at the time of his recruitment, and as announced to the market on 17December 2015, this award was only made once performance under the Essentra Long Term Incentive Plan was known and an accurate value could be placed on the award.
The award vested immediately upon grant.
If Matthew Gregory were to tender his resignation within 12 months of the grant of any of the above awards, to the extent it remains unexercised, the award will lapse.
To the extent an award has been exercised, the Committee may clawback the number of shares over which it was exercised or the amount of any proceeds of sale.
Income tax and employees national insurance contributions are payable by Matthew Gregory upon exercise of the awards.
Shares, net of tax, received by Matthew Gregory under the above awards must be retained by him until the requirements of the Companys shareholding guidelines as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report from time to time are met.

Remuneration of the Chief Executive The table below shows the total remuneration figure for the highest paid Executive Director, the Chief Executive, during each of the last seven years.
The total remuneration figure includes the annual bonus and LTIP awards which vested based on performance in those years.
The annual bonus percentages show the pay out for each year as a percentage of the maximum.
From 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2011, Tim OToole received remuneration of 357,000.

Percentage change in remuneration levels The table below shows the movement in the salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous financial year compared to that for the average UK employee First Bus and First Rail, but excluding Group.
The Committee has chosen this comparator as itfeels that it provides a more appropriate reflection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Groups total wage bill, which is distorted by movements in the number of employees and variations in wage practices in the US.
However, the Committee will re-assess the comparator in 2016 17 to ensure it remains appropriate.
For the benefits and bonus per employee, the figures are based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes.

External board appointments Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in connection with the Group business, the individual Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
For serving as a Director of CSX Corporation, Tim OToole receives a fee of $75,000 per annum which is taken in CSX common shares and an annual grant of $150,000 also in CSX common shares.
Both elements are deferred until Tim OToole leaves the board of CSX Corporation and therefore he does not receive any current compensation.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 89 Directors remuneration report continued Priorities for 2016 17 For the coming year it is anticipated that the Committee will focus on the following areas: supporting the Groups transformation plans, business objectives and strategic goals: ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements: implementing the remuneration policy: ongoing training of Committee members: and ensuring that remuneration arrangements are designed to promote the long term success of the Company and reward Company performance, with a focus on maintaining the link between performance and reward, whilst maintaining a prudent approach to cost and the risk to the business.
External adviser The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external independent remuneration consultants.
It is solely responsible for their appointment, retention and termination and for approval of the basis of their fees and other terms.
Over the course of the year, the Committee was supported by its appointed adviser, PwC.
PwC was appointed adviser to the Committee in 2014.
The Chair of the Committee agrees the protocols under which PwC provides advice.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the advice provided by PwC and confirmed that it was objective andindependent.
During the year, PwC provided independent advice and commentary on a range of topics including remuneration trends, corporate governance, incentive plan design and consulting with shareholders.
PwC fees for advice provided to the Committee were 121,750.
Fees were charged on atime and materials basis.
PwC also provided general consultancy services to FirstGroup during the year: however, the Committee is satisfied that this does not compromise the independence of the advice it has received from PwC.
Shareholder engagement During the year, the Committee wrote to, and had discussions with, a number of major investors and their representative bodies to seek their views on revisions to the LTIP design and structure to provide them with an opportunity to provide feedback.
The dialogue was constructive andshareholders were broadly supportive of the Committees approach on these matters.
When reviewing the remuneration framework of Executive Directors and senior managers, the Committee takes into account the views and guidance expressed by major investors and their representative bodies.
Shareholder votes on remuneration matters At the AGM on 16 July 2015, the resolutions on the remuneration policy and annual report on remuneration received the following votes from shareholders: Annual Report Remuneration Policy on Remuneration Votes for 779,923,966 93% 800,928,123 95% Votes against 60,313,189 7% 39,629,864 5% Total votes cast 840,237,155 840,557,987 Votes withheld 31,366,783 31,045,951 90 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance Directors remuneration policy Policy report The full remuneration policy approved for three years from the date of the 2015 Annual General Meeting held on 16 July 2015 is set out below for ease of reference only.
A shareholder vote on the remuneration policy is not required in 2016.
Following the retirement of Chris Surch as a Director on 1 December 2015, the elements of the remuneration policy relating to existing Executive Directors only apply to Tim OToole.
The remuneration policy has been updated to reflect the change of Chief Financial Officer.
The original remuneration policy can be found on pages 79 to 87 of the 2015 Annual Report and Financial Statements on the Companys website www.
There may be circumstances from time to time when the Committee will consider it appropriate to apply some judgement and exercise discretion in respect of the approved remuneration policy.
This ability to apply discretion is highlighted where relevant in the approved policy, and the use of discretion will always be in the spirit of the approved policy.

It will also operate the EABP and LTIP according to the rules of each respective plan andconsistently with normal market practice and the Listing Rules, including flexibility in a number of areas.
How the Committee will retain flexibility includes: when to make awards and payments: how to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how much of an award should vest: who receives an award or payment: how to deal with a change of control, restructuring or any other corporate event of the Group: whether an Executive Director or senior manager is a good bad leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest at the time of leaving or at the original vesting date s : how and whether an award or its performance conditions may be adjusted in certain circumstances e. g. change of accounting policy : the choice of and adjustment of performance measures, weightings and targets for each incentive plan from year to year in accordance with the remuneration policy set out above and the rules of each plan: and amending plan rules in accordance with their terms.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
Setting performance measures and targets In determining the levels of executive reward, the Committee places considerable emphasis on ensuring a strong and demonstrable link between actual remuneration received and the delivery of FirstGroups strategic plans.
The measures and weightings used under the EABP are selected annually to reflect the Groups key strategic initiatives for the year and reflect both financial and non-financial objectives.
The targets for the EABP are set by reference to the Companys strategy and internal budgets as well as the external context, such as market forecasts.
This approach seeks to ensure that the targets are appropriately challenging.
The LTIP provides a focus on delivering superior returns to shareholders by providing rewards for longer term growth and shareholder return outperformance.
The Committee reviews annually whether the performance measures, weightings and calibration of targets remain appropriate and sufficiently challenging taking into account the Companys strategic objectives and shareholder interests.
All-employee share awards are not subject to performance conditions in line with the treatment of such awards for all employees and in accordance with the applicable tax legislation.
Shareholding guidelines The Chief Executive is expected to hold shares equivalent in value to a minimum of 200% of base salary and other Executive Directors 150% ofbase salary within a five-year period from the later of their date of appointment or the approval of this remuneration policy.
Executive Directors are further required to retain at least 75% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under a Group share incentive plan or otherwise acquire shares in the Company until the shareholding guideline is met.
The Committee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of the guidelines where it believes it is justified by the circumstances.
In addition, Executive Directors are required to hold shares which vest under the LTIP for an additional holding period of two years following the three year performance period, with only those shares required to cover a tax liability on exercise or vesting of an LTIP award permitted to be sold.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 95 Directors remuneration report continued Group employee considerations In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall approach to reward for employees in the Group.
FirstGroup operates in a number of markets and its employees carry out a diverse range of roles across the UK and US.
All employees, including Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate and base salary levels are reviewed regularly.
When considering salary increases for Executive Directors, the Committee pays close attention to pay and employment conditions across the wider workforce.
The key difference between Executive Director remuneration and other employees is that, overall, the remuneration policy for Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay linked to business performance than for other employees, so that remuneration will increase or decrease in line with business performance and align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders.
In particular, long term incentives areprovided only to the most senior executives as they are reserved for those considered to have the greatest potential to influence overall levels of performance.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees on Executive Director remuneration, but as a result of the Companys all-employee share plans UK-based employees are able to become shareholders in the Company and can comment on the remuneration policy in the same way as other shareholders.
In addition, the Company provides a number of forums for employees to provide feedback on remuneration as well as receiving employee views from the Group Employee Director, who attends meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the Chair of the Committee.
Legacy arrangements The Committee may approve payments to satisfy commitments agreed prior to the approval of this remuneration policy.
This includes previous incentive awards that are currently outstanding and unvested which have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
The Committee may also approve payments outside of this remuneration policy in order to satisfy legacy arrangements made to an employee prior to and not in contemplation of promotion to the Board of Directors.
All historic awards that were granted but remain outstanding remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.

Maximum fixed pay plus 100% of maximum annual bonus pay-out and 100% vesting under the LTIP.
96 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance Approach to recruitment remuneration The Committee believes it is vital to be able to attract and recruit high calibre executives who are focused on delivering the Groups strategic plans, while relating reward to performance in the context of appropriate risk management, and aligning the interests of Executive Directors andsenior managers with those of shareholders to build a sustainable performance culture.
The Committees approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a new Executive Director is to take account of his or her remuneration package in their prior role, the market positioning of the remuneration package and not to pay more than is necessary to facilitate their recruitment.
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director will be set in accordance with the terms of the Companys approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment, except: Salary The salary level shall take into account companies in the comparator group, which comprises companies that are broadly inline with FirstGroups size, structure and complexity and have features that are comparable to FirstGroup.
The Committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a discount to the market level initially, withaseries of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the desired positioning, subject to individual performance.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has the ability to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a rate higher than the market level to reflect the criticality of the role and the experience and performance of the individual.
Benefits The Company may award certain additional benefits and other allowances including, but not limited to, those to assist with relocation support, temporary living and transportation expenses, educational costs for children and tax equalisation to allow flexibility in employing an overseas national.
Pension benefits Any new Executive Director based outside the UK will be eligible to participate in pension or pension allowance, insurance and other benefit programmes in line with local practice.
Annual bonus The maximum bonus opportunity shall be 150% of base salary.
Long Term The maximum opportunity shall be 200% of base salary for a newly recruited Chief Executive and 175% of base salary for IncentivePlan other newly recruited Executive Directors.
However, a maximum opportunity of 300% of base salary may be used in exceptional circumstances, in addition to any buy-out of forfeited awards.
Replacement The Committee shall consider what cash or replacement share-based awards, if any, are reasonably necessary to facilitate awards the recruitment of a new Executive Director in all circumstances.
This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation or benefits item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
These payments would not exceed what is considered by the Committee to be a fair estimate of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect, as far as possible, the nature and time horizons attaching to that remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions.
If the Executive Directors former employer pays a portion of the remuneration that was deemed foregone, the replacement payments will be reduced by an equivalent amount.
In the case of an internal executive appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its existing terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment will continue.
Notice periods The Committee shall utilise notice periods of up to 12 months.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement shall be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 97 Directors remuneration report continued Executive Directors service agreements The Executive Directors service agreements, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the calibre required to manage the Company.
The Committees policy is for Executive Directors service contracts to be terminable on no more than one years notice.
The details of existing Executive Directors service contracts are summarised in the table below: Executive Director Date of service contract Notice period Tim OToole 25 January 2011 12 months Matthew Gregory 1 December 2015 12 months Policy on payment for loss of office Executive Directors service agreements contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice.
The Company is unequivocally against rewards for failure: the circumstances of any departure, including the individuals performance, would be taken into account in every case.
Directors service agreements are kept for inspection by shareholders at the Companys registered office.
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment in lieu of notice in certain circumstances, such as gross misconduct.
The Company may require the Executive Director to work during their notice period or may choose to place the individual on garden leave, for example to ensure the protection of the Companys and shareholders interests where the Executive Director has access to commercially sensitive information.
Except in the case of gross misconduct or resignation, the Company may at its absolute discretion reimburse for reasonable professional fees relating to the termination of employment and, where an Executive Director has been required to re-locate, to pay reasonable repatriation costs, including possible tax exposure costs.
In the event of an Executive Directors departure, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the plan rules as follows: Plan Treatment on cessation EABP The EABP provides no entitlement to a bonus following cessation of employment, unless the leaver is considered a good leaver.
Where an individual is considered a good leaver in the event of death or termination of employment by reason of ill-health, disability, injury, statutory redundancy, agreed retirement, sale of employing company or business out of the Group or at the discretion of the Committee a performance-related bonus will be paid.
This will be based on the proportion of the bonus year for which the individual has been actively employed and bonus if any will be paid at the normal time, although the Committee retains discretion to pay it earlier in appropriate circumstances.
There is no entitlement to any bonus award under the EABP for any financial year where an Executive Director has not beenactively working, even if still in employment.
The Committee has discretion to make an award in these circumstances, but would only consider exercising its discretion if this were justified by the circumstances and timing of the Executive Directors departure.
The Committee will not exercise that discretion in respect of any period when the Executive Director ison garden leave.
Any resulting bonus payment will normally be time pro-rated and be based on the level of performance achieved.
Deferred share awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment or, at the Committees discretion, on service of notice of termination of employment.
However, under good leaver provisions other than in the case of death unvested EABP deferred shares will vest either at the end of the vesting period or in the event of termination by reason of ill-health onthe date of cessation of employment or any other date determined by the Committee.
Where an award vests early, thegood leaver will receive a pro-rated number of shares to reflect the acceleration of vesting, although in the event of termination by reason of ill-health the Company may exercise discretion to waive pro-rating.
In the case of death, deferred share awards vest on the date of death and no pro-rating is applied.
Long Term Awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment.
IncentivePlan However, in good leaver circumstances other than in the case of death unvested LTIP shares will vest either at the end ofthe performance period or in the event of termination of employment by reason of ill-health on the date of cessation of employment to the extent the performance conditions have been satisfied as determined by the Committee.
A good leaverwill normally receive a pro-rated proportion of any outstanding LTIP awards.
The Committee may choose to allow certain awards to vest while others lapse, depending on the circumstances of the case.
In the case of death, awards vest on the date of death and are not subject to the performance conditions, with pro-rating applying in the same way as for good leavers.
All-employee Awards will vest in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan, which do not permit the exercise of any discretion by shareplans theCommittee.
98 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance Policy on external appointments The Committee believes that the Company can benefit from Executive Directors holding one approved non-executive directorship of another company, offering Executive Directors the opportunity to broaden their experience and knowledge.
Company policy is to allow Executive Directors to retain the fees earned from such appointments.
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but each has a letter of appointment with the Company.
Eachletter of appointment generally provides for a three-month notice period.
Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for two consecutive three-year terms, with any third term of three years being subject to rigorous review and taking into account the need progressively torefresh theBoard.
In line with the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman are subject to annualre-election by shareholders at each AGM.
The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination withoutcompensation if he or she is not re-appointed at a meeting of shareholders.
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors may on occasion receive reimbursement of costs incurred in relation to professional advice.
These payments, ifmade, are taxable benefits to the Non-Executive Director and the tax arising is paid by the Company on the Directors behalf.
Chairmans fee The fee for the Chairman is determined by the Committee and reflects the commitment, demands and responsibility of the role.
The fee is paid monthly and can either be taken in cash or shares or a combination of both.
The fee is inclusive of all Committee roles and is not performancerelated or pensionable.
Limited benefits relating to travel, accommodation and meals may also be payable in certain circumstances, with the tax arising being paid by the Company on the Chairmans behalf.
Wolfhart Hauser receives a fee of 280,000.
The fee payable to the Chairman may be varied either up or down from this level during the three year period that this remuneration policy operates to ensure it continues to appropriately recognise the requirements of the role.
Group Employee Director The Group Employee Director receives a normal remuneration package, including participation in any benefit and incentive arrangements andpension scheme, for his or her regular employment duties appropriate to the role performed.
The Group Employee Directors fee as aNon-Executive Director is payable in addition to normal remuneration as an employee of FirstGroup.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2016 99 Directors remuneration report continued Non-Executive Director fees Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole, upon the recommendation of the Executive Directors and theChairman.
The policy on Non-Executive Directors fees is: Purpose and To be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain Non-Executive Directors necessary to contribute to a high performing Board.
linktostrategy Operation Fees are determined by the Board, within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association, with Non-Executive Directors abstaining from any discussion or decision on their fees.
The Board takes account of recognised best practice standards for such positions when determining the fee level andstructure.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee, with additional fees payable for chairmanship of the Companys key Committees and for performing the Senior Independent Director role.
Fees are paid monthly and can either be taken incash or shares or a combination of both.
Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice.
Other than the Group Employee Director, Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Companys incentive arrangements or receive any pension provision.
Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for expenses, and any tax arising on those expenses is settled directly by the Company.
To the extent that these are deemed taxable benefits, they will be included in the Annual Report on Remuneration, as required.
Reasonable costs of travel and accommodation for business purposes are reimbursed to Non-Executive Directors.
On the limited occasions when it is appropriate for a Non-Executive Directors spouse or partner to attend, such as to a business event, the Company will meet these costs.
The Company will meet any tax liabilities that may arise on such expenses.
Fee levels Fees per annum are: Non-Executive Director base fee: 52,500 Group Employee Director: 39,375 Senior Independent Director: 7,500 Chair of Audit Committee: 12,000 Chairs of Remuneration Committee and Board Safety Committee: 10,000.
The above fee levels may be varied either up or down during the three year period that the remuneration policy operates toensure they continue to appropriately recognise the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, increases or decreases to fee levels for Non-Executive Directors in general and fee levels in companies of a similar size and complexity.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee values its continued dialogue with shareholders and engages directly with them and their representative bodies at the earliest opportunity.
Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM, as well as any additional feedback and guidance received during the year isconsidered by the Committee as it develops the Companys remuneration framework and practices.
