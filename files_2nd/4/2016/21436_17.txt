To the extent that awards vest, the directors would receive the benefit of any dividends paid over the vesting period in the form of share-based dividend equivalents.

100 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Overview Our business Responsibility Financial review Risk Governance Financial statements Implementation of policy in 2017 An extract of our remuneration policy is set out on pages 108 to 111.
The full remuneration policy is published on our corporate website, www.
Below we detail how this policy will be applied in 2017.
Base salary and fees Effective from 1 January 2017, the base salary of Executive Directors will be 551,500 for James Drummond and 368,000 for Kevin Quinn increased by approximately 2.5%.
These increases are broadly consistent with the average salary increases across the broader employee population.
Non-Executive Directors base fees were increased by 4.6%.
These increases reect the signicantly increased workloads in recent years and are also designed to bring them further into line with levels paid at similarsized companies.
Further details of the fees effective from 1 January 2017 are detailed below: Changes to policy effective 1 January 2017 Senior Chairman of Independent Non-Executive Chairman fee Base fee Committee Director 200,000 57,000 12,000 6,600 Annual bonus: target setting for 2017 In accordance with our remuneration policy, the maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors is 130% of base salary, with 100% of the performance targets based on financial metrics.
The bonus outcome may be reduced if, at the Committees discretion, progress toward the Groups non-financial strategic priorities has not been satisfactory.
In addition, bonus outcomes will only be determined provided that the earnings per share EPS threshold has first been achieved.
The annual bonus targets for 2017 will be set in accordance with our remuneration policy and will remain aligned to our current strategic goals, namely: Strategic goals Link to strategic objectives a Adjusted earnings per share 50% a Captures long-term growth and improving financial returns by leveraging operational efficiency a The generation of free cash ow 25% a Encourages operational cash discipline and improving capital efficiency a Revenue 25% a Delivers sustainable organic growth The Committee will set calibrated targets for each of these three measures and intends to disclose these targets retrospectively in next years directors remuneration report.
The actual targets are therefore not being disclosed now as this is considered by the Committee to be commercially sensitive information because the majority of our competitors are in the private, unquoted sector and so are not required to publicly disclose the same level of information as Berendsen.
LTIP: Grant in 2017 In accordance with our remuneration policy approved at the 2016 AGM, long-term incentives in 2017 will comprise a PSP award.
Given the exceptional nature of the additional focus and accelerated investment required for the UK business, the Committee considered it appropriate to increase the long-term incentive opportunity to 240% of base salary for James Drummond.
The increased award is matched by the introduction of UK reinvestment related measures, as outlined on the next page, to incentivise and reinforce the leadership behaviours and focus required to deliver on the stretching targets relevant to the UK reinvestment plan over the next two to three years.
Kevin Quinn will continue to be granted an award equivalent to 200% of base salary and will also have UK reinvestment related measures included.
101 Berendsen plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Report on directors remuneration continued LTIP: Financial metrics and weightings Given the increased strategic focus on the UK businesses, the Committee has deemed it appropriate for executive performance to be measured against delivery of the UK reinvestment plan.
It has therefore been determined that the performance measures for the 2017 long-term incentive awards granted to Executive Directors should be rebalanced to accommodate the introduction of an additional financial target aligned to the UK reinvestment plan.
The weightings for the 2017 long-term incentive plan are detailed below: Financial metrics James Drummond Kevin Quinn EPS 100% 100% ROIC 70% 50% Financial target relating to the UK reinvestment plan 70% 50% Award as a % of base salary 240% 200% LTIP: Performance targets The performance targets approved by the Committee under the PSP during 2017 have been provided below.
For reasons of commercial sensitivity, full disclosure of the UK related target including all relevant threshold, target and maximum hurdles will be made at the time the awards are scheduled to vest.
EPS performance targets to be satisfied in 2019 Awards vesting Less than 72 pence 0% of award vests 72 pence 25% of award vests 85 pence 100% of award vests Between 72 pence and 85 pence Straight-line basis Weighted average ROIC to be satisfied for the 12-month period to 31 December 2019 Less than 9.5% 0% of award vests 9.5% 25% of award vests 10.5% 100% of award vests Between 9.5% and 10.5% Straight-line basis These targets are based on actual 2016 performance performance for the financial year ending immediately prior to the date of grant being 63.1 pence for adjusted EPS and 9.6% for ROIC.
The EPS targets above 72 pence to 85 pence maximise with a growth of approximately 35% over the three-year period and equates to annual growth of approximately 5% to 10%.
The ROIC target of 9.5% to 10.5% recognises the importance of generating returns well in excess of the Groups cost of capital during a period of significant capital investment for the Group.
Aligning long-term awards with strategic objectives Both EPS and ROIC measures are main Group KPIs and link to two of our strategic objectives, improving financial returns by leveraging operational efficiency and improving capital efficiency, respectively.
