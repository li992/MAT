co. uk 04 Directors remuneration report In setting the Directors remuneration policy, the Committee considers a range of factors including: Conditions elsewhere in the Group Across the Group, remuneration is reviewed regularly with the intention that all employees are paid appropriately in the context of their local market and given their individual skills, experience and performance.
Each business units salary increase budget is set with reference to local market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee considers salary increase budgets in each business unit when determining the salaries of Executive Directors.
Prudential does not consult with employees when setting the Directors remuneration policy: Prudential is a global organisation with employees, and agents in multiple business units and geographies.
As such, there are practical challenges associated with consulting with employees directly on this matter.
As many employees are also shareholders, they are able to participate in binding votes on the Directors remuneration policy and annual votes on the Annual report on remuneration.
Shareholder views The Remuneration Committee and the Company undertake regular consultation with key institutional investors on the remuneration policy and its implementation.
This engagement is led by the Remuneration Committee Chairman and is an integral part of the Companys investor relations programme.
The Committee is grateful to shareholders for their feedback and takes this into account when determining executive remuneration.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 117 Annual report on remuneration The Board has established Audit, Remuneration, Risk, Nomination and Governance Committees as principal standing committees of the Board.

118 Prudential plc Annual Report 2016 www.
co. uk 04 Directors remuneration report In 2016, the Committee met six times.
Key activities at each meeting are shown in the table below: Meeting Key activities February 2016 Approve the 2015 Directors remuneration report: consider 2015 bonus awards for Executive Directors: consider vesting of the long-term incentive awards with a performance period ending on 31 December 2015: and approve 2016 long-term incentive awards, performance measures and plan documentation.

Additionally, a number of resolutions in writing were approved by the Committee between these meetings relating to new Executive Directors remuneration arrangements and separation arrangements for an Executive Director who stepped down from the Board.
The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation.
The Committee also had the benefit of advice from: Group Chief Risk Officer: Chief Financial Officer: Group Human Resources Director: and Director of Group Reward and Employee Relations.
Individuals are never present when their own remuneration is discussed and the Committee is always careful to manage potential conflicts of interest when receiving views from Executive Directors or senior management about executive remuneration proposals.
During 2016, Deloitte LLP was the independent adviser to the Committee.
Deloitte was appointed by the Committee in 2011 following a competitive tender process.
As part of this process, the Committee considered the services that Deloitte provided to Prudential and its competitors as well as other potential conflicts of interest.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under their code of conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.
Deloitte regularly meets with the Chairman of the Committee without management present.
The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team providing remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with Prudential that may impair their independence and objectivity.
The total fees paid to Deloitte for the provision of independent advice to the Committee in 2016 were 48,050 charged on a time and materials basis.
During 2016, Deloitte gave Prudential management advice on remuneration, as well as providing guidance on capital optimisation, digital and technology, taxation, internal audit, real estate, global mobility and other financial, risk and regulatory matters.
Remuneration advice is provided by an entirely separate team within Deloitte.
In addition, management received external advice and data from a number of other providers.
This included market data and legal counsel.
This advice, and these services, are not considered to be material.
During the year, the Company has complied with the appropriate provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding Directors remuneration.
The deferred part of the bonus is subject to malus and clawback in accordance with the malus and clawback policies.
In line with the regulations, the estimated value of PLTIP releases in 2016 has been calculated based on the average share ADR price over the last three months of 2016 14.86 $37.02.
The actual value of PLTIPs, based on the share price on the date awards are released, will be shown in the 2017 report.
Tony Wilkeys LTIP release includes an award which vested on 23 September 2016 the share price on that date was 14.08 in addition to the awards which vest in 2017.
2016 pension benefits include cash supplements for pension purposes and contributions into DC schemes as outlined on page 127.
Each remuneration element is rounded to the nearest 1,000 and totals are the sum of these rounded figures.
Total remuneration is calculated using the methodology prescribed by Schedule 8 of the Companies Act.

These reflect the ambitions of the Group and business units, in the context of anticipated market conditions.

As at 31 December 2016, Prudentials IFRS operating profit performance during the periods 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016 and 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 was above the stretch targets for Group and all business units other than one which was between plan and the stretch target.
Remuneration in respect of performance periods ending in 2016 Long-term incentive plans with performance periods ending on 31 December 2016 Our long-term incentive plans have stretching performance conditions that are aligned to the strategic priorities of the Group.
In deciding the portion of the awards to be released, the Committee considered actual financial results against these performance targets.
The Committee also reviewed underlying Company performance to ensure vesting levels were appropriate.
The Directors remuneration policy contains further details of the design of Prudentials long-term incentive plans.
Prudential Long Term Incentive Plan PLTIP In 2014, all Executive Directors were granted awards under the PLTIP.
The awards were subject to challenging targets.
The weightings of these measures are detailed in the table below.
Weighting of measures IFRS profit 1 2 Executive Director Group TSR Group or business unit Michael McLintock 100% Jackie Hunt 50% 50% business unit target Barry Stowe 50% 50% business unit target Mike Wells 50% 50% business unit target All other Executive Directors 50% 50% Group Notes 1 Group TSR is measured on a ranked basis over three years relative to peers.
2 IFRS profit is measured on a cumulative basis over three years.
Under the Group TSR measure, 25 per cent of the award vests for TSR at the median of the peer group increasing to full vesting for performance within the upper quartile.
TSR is measured on a local currency basis since this has the benefit of simplicity and directness of comparison.
The peer group for the awards is: Aegon Aflac AIA AIG Allianz Aviva AXA Generali Legal & General Manulife MetLife Munich Re Old Mutual Prudential Financial Standard Life Sun Life Financial Swiss Re Zurich Insurance Group www.
co. uk Annual Report 2016Prudentialplc 125 Annual report on remuneration Continued Prudentials TSR performance during the performance period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 was between the median and upper quartile of the peer group ranked ninth.
The portion of the awards related to TSR which therefore vested was 41.7 per cent.
Under the IFRS measure, 25 per cent of the award vests for meeting the threshold IFRS profit set at the start of the performance period increasing to full vesting for performance at or above the stretch level.
The table below illustrates the cumulative performance achieved over 2014 to 2016 compared to the Group targets set in 2014: 2014-16 cumulative targets 2014-16 cumulative Overall Group Threshold Plan Maximum achievement vesting IFRS operating profit 8,525m 9,472m 10,419m 11,449m 100% The Committee determined that the cumulative IFRS operating profit target established for the PLTIP should be expressed using exchange rates consistent with the reported disclosures.
All the individual business units exceeded their stretch performance target and achieved 100% vesting, other than Asia which exceeded plan performance, but not the stretch target, and therefore vested at 95%.
Details of business unit IFRS targets have not been disclosed as the Committee considers that these are commercially sensitive and disclosure of targets at such a granular level would put the Company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.
The Committee will keep this disclosure policy under review based on whether, in its view, disclosure would compromise the Companys competitive position.

Michael McLintock previously participated in a contributory defined benefit scheme that was open at the time he joined the Company.
The scheme provided a target pension of two-thirds of final pensionable earnings on retirement for an employee with 30 years or more potential service who remained in service to normal retirement date.
Michael is a deferred member of the scheme and his normal retirement date under the scheme is age 60.
If Michael claims his deferred pension before this age it will be subject to an actuarial reduction and there are no additional benefits payable should he retire early.
At the end of 2016, the transfer value of Michaels entitlement was 1,505,483.
This equates to an annual pension of 59,662 which will increase broadly in line with inflation in the period to Michaels retirement at the normal retirement date.

The scheme provided an accrual of 1 60ths of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
John is a deferred member of this scheme and, on reaching the normal retirement date of 60, John has elected to defer payment of his pension.
At the end of 2016, the transfer value of Johns entitlement was 555,662.
This equates to an annual pension of 19,937, based on current late retirement factors.
The pension, once in payment, will be subject to statutory increases in line with the Consumer Prices Index.

Recruitment arrangements In making decisions about the remuneration arrangements for those joining the Board, the Committee worked within the Directors remuneration policy approved by shareholders and was mindful of: The skills, knowledge and experience that each new Executive Director brought to the Board: The need to support the relocation of executives to enable them to assume their roles: and Its commitment to honour legacy arrangements.
Appointing high-calibre executives to the Board and to different roles on the Board is necessary to ensure the Company is well positioned to develop and implement its strategy and deliver long-term value.
As the Company operates in an international marketplace for talent, the best internal and external candidates are sometimes asked to move location to assume their new roles.
Where this happens, the Company will offer relocation support.
The support offered will depend on the circumstances of each move but may include paying for travel, shipping services, the provision of temporary accommodation and other housing benefits.
Executives may receive support with the preparation of tax returns, but no current Executive Director is tax equalised.
Anne Richards joined the Board during the year and, as this resulted in Anne relocating to enable her to assume her role, relocation support in line with the approved Directors remuneration policy was provided.
In addition, on joining the Company, Anne forfeited share awards granted to her by her previous employer and a buy-out award in line with the approved Directors remuneration policy was provided.
Details of this relocation support and the buy-out award are included in the notes to the 2016 Single Figure table and in the section on long-term incentives awarded in 2016.
Payments to past Directors and payments for loss of office The Committees approach when exercising its discretion under the policy is to be mindful of the particular circumstance of the departure and the contribution the individual made to the Group.
Michael McLintock Michael McLintock stepped down from the Board on 6 June 2016.
His remuneration arrangements were in line with the approved Directors remuneration policy, and disclosed in stock exchange announcements, and the remuneration he received in respect of his services as an Executive Director is set out in the 2016 Single Figure table.
Michaels employment with the Group ended on 31 July 2016 and between 7 June and 31 July he received 76,024 in respect of salary, benefits and pension in accordance with his contract of employment.
In line with market practice, the Group paid the professional legal fees incurred by him in respect of finalising his termination arrangements, which amounted to 7,800.
In addition, in consideration of agreeing to a confidentiality clause, Michael received 1,000.
Michael did not receive a loss of office payment.
Michaels deferred bonus awards will be released in accordance with the plan rules and remain subject to malus and, for the 2015 award, clawback provisions.
Recognising his contribution to the Companys success, the Committee determined that Michael should be awarded a bonus in respect of the 2016 performance year which was calculated in the usual way and pro-rated for service to 31 July 2016.
60 per cent of this bonus will be paid in 2017 and 40 per cent will be deferred for three years, subject to malus and clawback provisions.
The Committee also exercised its discretion in accordance with the approved Directors remuneration policy and determined that Michael should be allowed to retain his unvested PLTIP and M&G LTIP awards granted in 2014 and 2015.
The 2014 and 2015 awards will vest in accordance with the original timetable, subject to the original performance conditions, remain subject to malus and, for the 2015 award, clawback provisions, and were pro-rated for service.
Michael did not receive a 2016 long-term incentive award.
