Against this backdrop, the committee reviewed executive remuneration arrangements as well as remuneration arrangements for the broader employee population.
Inparticular, as indicated in last years Annual Report, thecommittee has spent the majority of 2016 focusing onreviewing the structure of the Groups existing phantom share option plan to assess its continued suitability for incentivising the executives and Group employees and to look at the options for an alternative long-term incentive plan employee share option scheme.

Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 100 | Remuneration Committee Report continued 2016 annual report on remuneration Notes on the single total figure remuneration table Base salaries The committee reviewed salaries and it was decided that given the precipitous drop in the oil price in the second half of 2015 and the resulting effect on the Groups revenues, executive directors would not be awarded any salary increases for 2016.
When reviewing salaries, the committee also considered the provisions of the remuneration policy.
Annual bonus In the last financial year all executive directors were eligible for a bonus.
In accordance with the Companys remuneration policy the maximum annual bonus opportunity is 40% of base compensation and is assessed against financial and operational objectives.
Refer to page 107 of the remuneration policy for more information in relation to the Companys bonus policy.
All bonuses are discretionary and can be reduced from the maximum annual bonus opportunity level for reasons such as poorperformance by the employee or due to disappointing financial performance of the Group as a whole.
For the bonus year which ran from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016, the key performance indicators for annual cash bonuses for executive directors including details of any commercially sensitive targets not disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report were as follows: % of 2016 bonus performance measures Weight Actual base salary Operational and financial 40% 34% 13.6% Hydrocarbon production above 42,000 boe day 20% 19% 7.6% Progress GTU3 construction to achieve mechanical completion by end of May 2017 10% 5% 2% Implement cost-reduction programme targeting reduction in operational and G&A 10% 10% 4% expenses by at least 25% and specific transport and sales expenses by at least 15% compared to 2015 actuals Strategic objectives 15% 10% 4% Renegotiate PSA terms to allow full cost recoverability and with the goal of restoring 10% 5% 2% the PSA balance of economic interests Develop and implement functional organisation within the Group and delegate 5% 5% 2% authority to budget owners to improve efficiency HSE, social and governance Including reduction in lost time injuries per 1 million man hours worked below 2 5% 0% 0% Sub-total: Corporate KPIs 60% 44% 17.6% Personal objectives 40% 31% 12.4% Frank Monstrey a selection of specific targets supporting the corporate KPIs 40% 31% 12.4% and Board functions Kai-Uwe Kessel a combination of specific targets supporting the corporate KPIs 40% 28% 11.2% and including production, exploration and strategic targets Jan-Ru Muller a combination of specific targets supporting the corporate KPIs 40% 27% 10.8% including maintaining financial strength, financial reporting and riskassessment Tom Richardson a combination of specific targets supporting the corporate KPIs 40% 34% 13.6% including maintaining financial strength, financial reporting and riskassessment Total Frank Monstrey 100% 75% 30% Total Kai-Uwe Kessel 100% 72% 28.8% Total Jan-Ru Muller 100% 71% 28.4% Total Tom Richardson 100% 78% 31.2% Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial report Regulatory information Additional disclosures | 101 As performance of the executive directors was within a range of between 71-78% the committee decided to award each ofthem a bonus equal to 75% of maximum bonus opportunity.
Based on an assessment of Company and individual performance of the executive directors during 2016 the committee awarded bonuses of between 28.8% and 31.2% of base salary to the executive directors.
The committee made this determination for the following reasons: the Group averaged 40,351 boepd production during 2016 and therefore, despite particularly high average daily production figures in the last quarter of 2016, the executive directors did not meet their full average production target of 42,000 boepd: despite steady progress being made on GTU-3 during 2016 and whilst mechanical completion is scheduled to be achieved in 2017 it will not be completed by the end of May 2017: the Group succeeded in reducing operational and G&A expenses by at least 25% and specific transport and sales expenses by at least 15% compared with 2015 actuals: the Group continued with its negotiations with the Kazakh government to allow for full cost recoverability under its PSA and to restore the balance of economic interests but the process has taken longer than originally anticipated as achievement of this target relies on the cooperation of external parties: good progress has been made with the development and implementation of a functional organisation across the Group.
Anew senior management team was implemented in September 2016 and new internal policies have been developed to allow for the implementation of a functional organisational, but there is still work left to do in 2017 on the future implementation of the new structure across the entire Group: and the Group ended 2016 with 2.99 lost time injuries per 1 million hours worked and therefore the target of 2 lost time injuries per 1 million hours worked was not met.
The Company does not provide for any clawback provisions regarding annual bonuses as annual bonuses are awarded on alump sum basis based on past performance and payable in July of the following year and so the rationale behind a clawback mechanism is less relevant.
Long-term incentive awards In 2016, the Company did not operate a performance based long-term incentive scheme.
Pension entitlements The Company does not operate a pension scheme and accordingly no element of remuneration is pensionable.
Payments to past directors No payments were made to past directors of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Payments for loss of office No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the year ended 31 December 2016.
Non-executive director fees No review of non-executive director fees has been conducted and therefore the annual fees for non-executive directors will remain the same in 2017 as they were in 2016.
The next review of non-executive director fees is expected to occur in 2018.
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC Annual Report 2016 102 | Remuneration Committee Report continued 2016 annual report on remuneration Directors shareholdings The beneficial interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2016 were as follows: Director Total audited Frank Monstrey 24,888,950 Kai-Uwe Kessel 10,000 Tom Richardson 1 Eike von der Linden 15,160 Atul Gupta Sir Christopher Codrington, Bt.

At present, the Company does not impose any shareholding guidelines on directors and there have been no changes in the interests of the directors or their persons closely associated in the period between the end of the financial year 2016 and the date of this Annual Report.
Phantom share option plan The Company currently operates one non-performance related share option plan the Plan.
As at 31 December 2016, the executive directors each held the following options over ordinary shares of the Company, generally vesting over a five-year period, exercisable at either US$4.00 or US$10.00 per ordinary share and expiring ten years from the date of grant, pursuant to the Plan: Options Options exercised lapsed Option Options during during Options exercise held at the the held at price Audited Date 31 December Face value financial year financial year 31 December US$ per Director of grant 2015 in USD 2016 2016 2016 option Expiry date Frank Monstrey 1 27.03.08 700,974 700,974 4.0 26.03.18 Kai-Uwe Kessel 2 26.03.13 200,000 18,000 200,000 10.0 25.03.23 1 27.03.08 120,130 120,130 4.0 26.03.18 3 Jan-Ru Muller 26.03.13 70,000 6,300 70,000 10.0 25.03.25 2 Tom Richardson 26.03.13 110,000 9,900 110,000 10.0 25.03.23 1 The options do not have a face value at the date of the grant, since the grant date was before the GDR listing on the London Stock Exchange on 1April 2008.

3 Such options are held by a Company associated with Mr Muller, Tengarra Capital B. V. Mr Muller resigned as a Director of the Company on 1 September 2016.
There have been no changes in the interests in the Plan between the end of the financial year 2016 and the date of this AnnualReport.
The Plan rules do not contain any malus or clawback mechanisms but going forward management will require any recommendations by the Company to the option trustee of an option award to be made subject to an express right for theCompany to suspend further vesting and to claw back unvested options previously awarded where there has been exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct, misbehaviour, significant risk failures or material downturns intheGroups financial performance prior to vesting.
