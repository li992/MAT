82 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 How our policy actually influences levels of remuneration Under our policy, a significant proportion of remuneration is linked to performance.
The charts below show how much the Executive Directors could earn under Mities remuneration policy as detailed above under different performance scenarios.
The following assumptions have been made: Minimum performance below threshold fixed pay only comprising salaries effective as of 1 April 2016, benefits received in the year ended March 2016 and pension received in 2016: On-target performance fixed pay plus an on-target bonus and 25% of the maximum possible LTIP award vesting.
Ontarget bonus represents 90% of salary for financial targets and 50% of the maximum for strategic targets: and Maximum performance fixed pay plus maximum bonus and maximum LTIP awards.
The scenarios do not include share price growth or dividend assumptions.
com 83 The Companys remuneration policy continued Our policy on Executive Directors service contracts All Directors are appointed on rolling service contracts but are subject to annual re-election at the AGM in accordance with the Code.
Under the service contracts, the Company is required to give 12 months notice of termination of employment: Executive Directors are required to give six months notice.
For Executive Directors, if notice is served by either party, the Executive Director can continue to receive basic salary, benefits and pension for the duration of their notice period during which time the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil their current duties or may assign a period of garden leave.
With respect to the current Group Finance Directors contract, the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice equivalent in value up to 12 months salary payable either in monthly instalments or as a lump sum.
The Company will also pay for any benefit for which the individual would have been eligible until the date of cessation had full notice been given.
The Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at Mities registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
There are no other provisions for compensation on termination of employment set out within the contracts of the Executive Directors.
For future Directors, notice periods will not exceed 12 months, save in exceptional circumstances: and should a notice period longer than 12 months be necessary the Committee would expect this to reduce to a 12 months notice period over time.
The effective dates of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below: Date of agreement Ruby McGregor-Smith, CBE 01-Apr-03 Suzanne Baxter 10-Apr-06 Our policy on external appointments The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to non-executive positions at other companies can be beneficial for both the individual director and the group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge.
Ruby McGregor-Smith, CBE received fees of 58,000 pa in respect of her role as a Non-Executive Director of Michael Page International plc and 15,000 for her role as Non-Executive Director of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
Suzanne Baxter received fees of 55,415 for her role as a Non-Executive Director of WH Smith plc.
Both individuals are entitled to retain any fees earned.
Our policy on Non-Executive Director remuneration and appointment terms The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive an annual fee which is paid in monthly instalments.
The Chairmans fee is set by the Remuneration Committee and the fees for the Non-Executive Directors are approved by the Board, on the recommendation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairing a Committee, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes, Annual Bonus Plan, the pension scheme and nor do they receive any ancillary benefits.
The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at Mities registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for an initial term of three years which is terminable on either three or six months notice and thereafter on a rolling term.
They are also subject to annual re-election.

Larry Hirst, CBE, was appointed as Senior Independent Director from 14 July 2015.
Crawford Gillies stepped down as a Director of the Board at the AGM on 13 July 2015.
Mark Reckitt was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2015 and assumed his responsibilities as Chairman of the Audit Committee on 14 July 2015.
How does the executive pay policy differ from that for other Mitie employees?
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees, ensuring that the greater part of their pay is conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy.
This helps create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Directors.
The LTIP is limited to the most senior employees.
For employees below this level, variable pay may consist of share-based awards and annual bonus both of which will be based on role and the opportunity to participate in SAYE and SIP.
How we take account of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when setting our policy The Remuneration Committee is responsible for overseeing the remuneration policy for the group as a whole and is mindful of pay and employment conditions in the wider workforce within the group and externally when determining executive remuneration.
When considering base salary increases, benefits and pension provision, the Committee reviews overall levels and increases offered to employees across the group.
The Committee also reviews information with regard to share awards made to other senior management of the group, noting that i all employees can participate in the SAYE and SIP, and ii participation in the LTIP is limited to a selection of senior executives.
However, consistent with general practice, the Committee does not consult with employees in preparing the policy or its implementation.
How we take account of shareholder views when setting our policy The Committee is committed to a continuing discussion with major shareholders and obtains their views when any significant changes to remuneration arrangements are being proposed.
Remuneration Committee and its advisors The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate.
FIT Remuneration Consultants FIT were appointed by the Committee in December 2013 to provide independent advice on executive remuneration.
FIT attended Committee meetings and provided advice and analysis of executive remuneration.
The advisors provide no other services to the Company save in relation to services connected to executive remuneration and share plans and also comply with the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants.
FITs total cost of advice to the Committee for the year they advised was 95,317 such fees being charged in accordance with FITs standard terms of business.
The Committee specifically considered the position of FIT and was satisfied that the advice the Committee received was objective and independent, given that no other services were provided to the Company.
com 85 Annual Report on Remuneration Executive Director remuneration subject to audit The table below reports a single figure of total remuneration for each Executive Director for the financial years ending 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016.
Bonus payable in respect of the financial year includes any deferred element at face value at the date of award.
Further information about how the level of the award, for the year ending March 2016, was determined is provided on page 88.
The value of the 2016 LTIP is based on the 2013 LTIP award, which will vest in June 2016 at a rate of 69.5% valuation based on the number of shares vesting at the share price calculated as an average over the period 1 January to 31 March 2016 of 277.9p and including the value of the Dividend Equivalent to date.
The value of the 2015 LTIP has been restated from the figures disclosed in the 2015 report, to reflect the actual share price on vesting of 315.2p.
The Other column denotes the value of the 1 in 10 matching shares awarded under the Company Share Incentive Plan, of 180, following the investment by each individual of a lump sum of 1,800 at the beginning of the tax year.
It also includes 1,512 in respect of the intrinsic gain on 2,381 SAYE options granted in the year being equal to the 20% discount from a share price of 317.5p to arrive at an exercise price of 254.0p.
The pension benefits of the Directors comprise a pension supplement paid in cash in the year of 20% of salary and a capped cash contribution to a defined benefit pension scheme of 22,200 2015: 16,104 made by Mitie for each of the Directors.
The disclosures above in respect of pension benefits comprise the 20% pension supplement along with an actuarially derived value of the annually accrued pension benefits under the defined benefit pension scheme, net of personal contributions made by each Director.
This calculation is known as the net pension input amount and is affected by the number of years of scheme membership, the value of annually accrued benefits at each year end, inflation and a prescribed multiplication factor of 20.

86 Mitie Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 What happened in 2015 2016 and changes for 2016 2017 Base salary and benefits Effective 1 April 2015, the Remuneration Committee awarded average salary increases of 2.9% for the two Executive Directors, resulting in the following base salaries being payable: Ruby McGregor-Smith, CBE 565,950 Suzanne Baxter 360,150 Commencing 1 April 2016 and effective for the remainder of the financial year, the Committee awarded salary increases of 2.5% for the Executive Directors which is in line with the average salary increases awarded to Mities salaried non-contract UK employees, resulting in the following base salaries being payable: Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE 580,099 Suzanne Baxter 369,154 A review of Non-Executive Director fees was undertaken in March 2014.
The broad policy is for the fees to be reviewed every three years.
The fees for the year ending March 2016 remain unchanged and are as follows: Base salary fees 000 1 2016 2015 2 Chairman fees 185 185 3 Non-Executive Director core fees 52 52 Additional fees Senior Independent Director 7 7 Chairman of a Committee 8 8 Notes: 1.
The core fees of 52,000 paid to each Non-Executive Director including the Chairman will total 260,000 for the year ending March 2017.
Total fees including additional duties are expected to amount to 416,000 for the year ending March 2017 405,000 actual for the year ended March 2016.
The Chairmans fee is inclusive of the Non-Executive Director core fee and no additional fees are paid to the Chairman where he is a Chairman, or is a member of other committees.
For Non-Executive Directors, individual fees comprise the core fee and additional supplemental fees for chairing committees where a greater responsibility and time commitment are required.
Benefits are as described in the Remuneration Policy table.
No changes are planned for the year ending March 2017 save where required to take account of legislative changes to the pensions regime.
Pension subject to audit Pension provision for 2015 16 is as described in the Remuneration Policy table.
The pension entitlement for each Director was as follows: Defined benefit pension scheme transfer values Transfer value Increase in of pension Contributions accrued increase after Normal Transfer value made by pension over inflation, net of Transfer value retirement 31 March 2015 the Director the year contributions 31 March 2016 date 000 000 000 000 000 Ruby McGregor-Smith, CBE 22 02 2028 307 0 3 36 361 Suzanne Baxter 16 04 2033 59 0 2 25 92 The pension benefits of the Executive Directors were based on a pensionable salary capped at 150,000.
The Company made contributions to the groups defined benefit scheme on behalf of the two Directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10.3% previously 9% of the value of the capped salary this increase followed the triennial valuation of the pension scheme in 2014.
The Company also contributes to the administrative costs of the pension scheme based on a percentage of salary which, due to the declining active membership, has risen to 4.5% previously 2% of the capped salary.
In addition, the Directors received a salary supplement as described in the policy table.
The normal retirement age for the two Directors is 65 and no additional benefits are available to the Directors upon early retirement.
The transfer value is an actuarially determined capital value of the pension benefits, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.
It is possible for transfer values to go down as well as up.
com 87 What happened in 2015 2016 and changes for 2016 2017 continued A review has been undertaken this year to assess the implications of recent changes in legislation relating to the impact of the cessation of contracting out, and regarding the tax efficiency of pension savings for higher earners.
From the new financial year the Committee intends to change the method of delivering the defined benefit pension value to the Executive Directors.
This does not increase the costs of this benefit to the business.
Going forward and reflecting market practice, the Executive Directors will cease to accrue benefits in the groups defined benefit scheme and will instead receive an additional cash supplement of an equivalent value.
Annual Bonus Plan Awards in respect of the year ended March 2016 were made under the Group Annual Bonus Plan.
The outcomes were determined as set out below.
At the beginning of the year the Committee set a range for performance on operating profit before other items for threshold, target and maximum levels of performance as follows: a threshold of 126.3m, a target of 133.0m and a maximum of 139.6m.
This generated a pay-out of 71.5% of salary which was 65.0% of the maximum award under this element of the Plan.
The Committee also set objectives relating to: organic revenue growth: people management: back office and operational efficiencies: healthcare: and customer proposition and strategic development.
Key deliverables for the year included: to deliver organic revenue growth at a level that outperforms sector comparatives for UK businesses with clear strategic plans for continued development of key accounts: to strengthen the talent pipeline: streamline procurement processes and back office services across the business: implementation of the MiHomecare business plan: and review of the FM customer proposition over the next five years.
Having evaluated a range of outcomes and indicators of performance, the Committee determined that overall progress was good and warranted a pay-out of 45.0% of salary for the Chief Executive and 22.5% of salary for the Group Finance Director.
The Committee believes that these objectives are commercially sensitive and so does not believe it is in shareholders interests to make any further disclosure.
Therefore, based on the Committees assessment of achievement of both the financial and the strategic objectives, the bonus was calculated as follows: Financial performance Strategic performance Total bonus payable % of salary % of salary % of salary % of salary % of salary Total Deferred payable at payable at payable at % of salary payable at payable at % of salary bonus Cash shares threshold on-target maximum payable threshold maximum payable 000 000 000 Ruby McGregorSmith, CBE 60 90 110 71.5 0 50 45.0 659.3 565.9 93.4 Suzanne Baxter 60 90 110 71.5 0 25 22.5 338.5 338.5 0.0 The Annual Bonus Plan will be operated on similar terms for the year ended March 2017.
The targets are at present commercially sensitive and so are not disclosed in this report.
However, as above, details of the targets will be disclosed in next years report.
