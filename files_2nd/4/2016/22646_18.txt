58 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2016 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 2015-2016 REMUNERATION REVIEW CONCLUSION The remuneration philosophy at Compass is to ensure The Committee believes that the current executive close alignment between performance and reward so we have remuneration policy works effectively to motivate and retain incentive plans which are based on the strategic KPIs by which our executive team whilst supporting the delivery of superior the business is measured and managed.
We measure performance returns to shareholders.
Therefore, the principles underlying delivered in the financial year for the annual bonus and over our executive remuneration remain unchanged, namely a three financial years to determine the number of shares that balanced approach, with incentives based on strategic key have been earned under the LTIP.
The measures and the performance metrics so our executives remuneration reflects incentive opportunity are unchanged from last year.
The Policy approved at the 2015 AGM will remain in place until the 2018 AGM when, in accordance For the annual bonus we measure both Group and, where with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups relevant, regional performance.
This has led to a range of bonus Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013 the outcomes as illustrated in the at a glance summary on page 60 2013 Regulations, the policy to apply for the next three years and also in the main Directors Remuneration Report, where to the 2021 AGM will be submitted to shareholders for approval.
both the Group and Regional bonus targets, to which these outcomes relate, are disclosed in full.
In the meantime, we welcome the opportunity to engage with shareholders about any aspect of our remuneration policy, its The TSR element of the LTIP was earned in full because implementation and how we believe it drives superior returns th Compass ranked 8 against other FTSE 100 companies to shareholders.
We were very pleased to receive good support excluding financial services companies.
The targets we set for the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report at the AGM in based on Adjusted Group Free Cash Flow and Return on Capital February2016.
Shareholders will have the opportunity to vote Employed were demanding and were satisfied in part 92.7% and on the Annual Remuneration Report for 2015-2016 at our AGM 60.7% respectively.
The Committee considers this outcome to to be held on Thursday 2February 2017.
I look forward to be a fair and balanced result.
welcoming you and hope to receive your support again.
We have maintained our approach of basing our pay decisions on reported numbers with principled and consistent adjustments to ensure that we are paying for underlying performance.
The Committee believes that a clear approach to the treatment of any adjustments to reported numbers, for the purposes of determining the incentive outcome, is in the best interests Carol Arrowsmith of both shareholders and participants.
This is why, for example, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee we exclude the impact of currency movements, whether positive 22 November 2016 or negative, from the measures used in the management incentives.
Other potential adjustments are tested against a set of pre-agreed criteria to ensure an appropriate outcome in the circumstances which reflects the true underlying performance of the business.
Our historic balanced approach has continued this year with salary increases for the executive directors within the general adjustment range used for others within the Group, with one exception.
As was signalled in last years remuneration report, Johnny Thomson was appointed to the role of Group Finance Director at a salary below the market rate, reflecting that this was his first PLC director role.
Johnny has performed very well during the year and, consequently, will receive an increase of 8% in salary, with effect from 1 January 2017, to reflect both his strong performance and increasing experience.
This will still place Johnny below the market rate for equivalent roles in similar organisations.
As indicated previously, above inflation pay increases are likely to be necessary for another one to two years to ensure his pay is appropriately aligned with that of his peers, subject, of course, to his continued strong performance in the role.
In developing the remuneration policy for shareholder approval in 2018, the Committee will consider the changing executive remuneration environment, including that related to pensions.

Mr Thomson also has an interest in 10,622 shares which were awarded in connection with a below board plan prior to his appointment as a director of the Company, more details of which can be found on page70.
TSR ranking was 8 in its comparatorgroup.
The value of the shares on vesting has been calculated by reference to the average market price of Compass Group PLC shares over the three months from 1July to 30 September2016 1464.25 pence per share.
The table below shows the targets against which performance will be measured to determine the vesting of the grant of awards to be made in the year ending 30 September 2017 and forms part of the Policy detailed in the Policy Report on pages 62 to 68.
TARGETS FOR AWARDS TO BE MADE ON 23 NOVEMBER 2016 FOR THE YEAR ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2017 AFCF and ROCE target LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE VESTING % OF EACH COMPONENT AFCF ROCE Threshold 0% 2,609m 18.10% Par target 50% 2,746m 18.60% Maximum 100% 2,883m 19.10% TSR target LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE VESTING % OF EACH COMPONENT Below Median 0% Median 25% Upper Quartile 100% The vesting of the shares under each performance condition is independent.
Therefore, the total vesting amount is based on the relevant percentage achievement for each performancemeasure.
Awards vest on a straight line basis between Threshold and Par and between Par and Maximum.
If performance under a component does not exceed the Threshold level, vesting for that component will be nil.
At the end of the performance period, the Committee will review the underlying financial performance of the Company and retain its discretion to adjust vesting if it considers that financial performance isunsatisfactory.
In setting targets for the awards in the year ending 30 September 2017, the Committee set a target requiring an improvement in underlying ROCE.
It is recognised that tax rates for the performance period will be higher for the prior periods, and this will reduce reported ROCE.
The Committee considers the measures and targets to be appropriate and challenging.
Calculations of the achievement of the targets will be independently performed and approved by the Committee.
The Committee will retain discretion to adjust for material events which occur during the performance period and the nature of any such adjustments will be disclosed in the DRR, together with details of the achieved AFCF, ROCE and TSR performance, as determined by the above definitions, at the end of the performance period.
