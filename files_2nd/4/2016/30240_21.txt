Rakesh Sharma ceased accruing a Martin Broadhurst, direct benefit from the defined benefit scheme Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 6 April 2014 and his pension provision has been determined on an annual basis by the scheme actuary such that it is equivalent in value to the value of defined benefits formerly accrued.
The Committee has decided to fix Rakesh Sharmas pension provision at the existing rate rather than continuing with an annual calculation by the scheme actuary, which the Committee would expect to increase over the medium to long term.
This will prevent any further increases to Rakesh Sharmas pension contribution and is consistent with the closure of the scheme to future accrual for the wider workforce.
The Committee did consider reducing the provision but believes the proposed approach is consistent with that taken for other senior managers who were in the defined Revenue benefit scheme and is therefore appropriate.

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Implementation of the Directors Remuneration Policy in 2017 A summary of how the Directors Remuneration Policy will be applied for the year ending 31 December 2017 is set out below.
Salaries Current Executive Director salary levels, and increases effective in April 2017, are as follows: Increase 2017 2016 awarded from Salary Salary 1 April 2017 000 000 % R. Sharma 550 535 2.8 1 A. Sharma 320 290 10.3 M. Anderson 261 254 2.5 1 Amitabh Sharma was appointed Group Finance Director with effect from 4 May 2016.
Rakesh Sharma and Mark Anderson will receive an inflationary base salary increase of 2.8% and 2.5% respectively from 1 April 2017, in line with the average increase awarded to the workforce as a whole.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, Amitabh Sharma was appointed with a salary below competitive levels and his salary will be increased to an industry competitive level as he gains experience in the role.
From 1 April 2017, Amitabh Sharmas salary will increase by 10.3%.
Directors pension entitlements As we committed to in last years Directors Remuneration Report, a review of the pension provision has been carried out.
The Committee proposes to fix Rakesh Sharmas pension provision at the existing rate of 36.4% down from 37.3% last year, rather than continuing with an annual calculation by the scheme actuary, which the Committee would expect to increase over the medium to long term.
This will prevent any further increases to Rakesh Sharmas pension contribution and is consistent with the ending of the scheme for the wider workforce.
Amitabh Sharma and Mark Anderson are eligible to participate in the defined contribution scheme, receiving annual company contributions of 18% of salary.
They can elect to receive cash supplements in lieu of pension contributions on a cash-neutral basis where they have exceeded the annual allowance or the lifetime allowance.
Non-Executive Directors fees The Chairmans fee will increase by 2.5% and other Non-Executive Directors fees will increase by 2.7% from 1 April 2017 in line with the Remuneration Policy.
Annual bonus for 2017 Subject to the approval of the Remuneration Policy by shareholders, the maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2017 will be 125% of base salary: 20% of the bonus paid will be deferred into Ultra shares for three years.
Up to 22.5% of maximum will be payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target, up to 67.5% payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target, and up to 10% of maximum will be payable for the achievement of strategic personal measures.
For the financial measure, 0% of the maximum will be payable for threshold performance.
For the profit target, vesting occurs on a straight line basis from threshold to maximum.
For the operating cash target, vesting occurs on a straight line basis from threshold to target and on a straight line basis from target to maximum.
No bonus will be paid in respect of the non-financial element of the bonus if the Committee considers the Companys financial performance to be unsatisfactory or there is an exceptional negative event during or just after the relevant financial year.
As the Committee considers that commercial sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward-looking annual bonus targets, retrospective disclosure of the targets will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long-term awards to be granted in 2017 Consistent with the amended Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 125% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2017.
For 2017, it is intended that the following measures and weightings will apply: Total Shareholder Return measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts : 25% Return on Invested Capital ROIC : 25% Annual growth in organic underlying operating profit: 25% Annual growth in organic revenue: 25% Ultra Electronics Holdings plc.

Annual bonus for year under review Audited Annual bonuses in relation to 2016 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets, as well as individual strategic objectives.
Financial targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board.
They were adjusted where appropriate to provide a suitable degree of stretch challenge and incentive to outperform.
Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to page 28 for details.
The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2016 were: a maximum of 20% of salary subject to the achievement of 117.2m underlying profit before tax : and a maximum of 60% of salary subject to achieving an underlying operating cash flow of 118.5m and the Committee exercising its discretion on movements in working capital to ensure working capital management throughout the financial year was in the short and long-term interests of the Company.
The remaining 20% of the bonus potential reflected strategic goals.
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows: Actual Bonus Threshold Maximum achieved payable 000 000 000 % Underlying profit before tax 105,480 117,200 120,059 20% Operating cash flow 66,346 118,500 120,434 42.2% These figures reflect amendments to the original targets following the disposal of the ID business in August 2016.
Both threshold profit and operating cash flow targets needed to be exceeded for any payment to be made.

LTIP vesting for year under review Audited The LTIP awards granted in 2014 were based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2016.
As disclosed in previous Annual Reports, the performance condition for this award was as follows: Threshold Stretch % Metric Performance condition target target Actual Vesting Total TSR against constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Median ranking Upper quartile Median 0% Shareholder investment trusts.
20% vesting for median performance, ranking Return TSR increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for upper quartile performance or above.

Total defined benefit pension entitlements Audited The defined benefit scheme closed to future accrual on 5 April 2016.
Under the scheme, a pension equal to two-thirds of pensionable salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the pensionable salary for each year of service.
With the Groups consent, Executive Directors may retire from age 55.
After age 58, Group consent to early retirement is not required.
The pension is reduced in the event of early retirement.
In the event of death-in-service, a spouses pension of up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Executive Director, a spouses pension of 50% of the Executive Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Executive Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index.
This is capped at 7.5% for service prior to 1 April 2008 and at 5% thereafter, above which increases are at the Trustees and the Groups discretion.
No Executives accrued direct benefits under defined benefit schemes during the year.
As Rakesh Sharma ceased accruing a direct benefit from 6 April 2014, his pension provision was determined on an annual basis by the scheme actuary such that it is equivalent in value to the value of defined benefits formerly accrued.
As explained earlier in this Report, Rakesh Sharmas pension provision is fixed at the rate of 36.4% as from 1 April 2016.
Payments to past Directors Audited Mary Waldner tendered her resignation in November 2015 and left on 16 March 2016.
She was paid up to that date and no further payments were or are due to her.
