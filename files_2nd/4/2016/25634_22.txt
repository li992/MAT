OTHER KEY DECISIONS Shareholding Guidelines There will be no changes to the Non-Executive Directors fees for 2017.

2013 LTIP OUT-TURN ADJUSTMENT The vesting of the 2013 LTIP was based on EPS performance Bruce Carnegie-Brown measured to the 2015 financial year.
As explained in detail in Note 9 to the Financial Statements on page 129, the 2015 28 February 2017 basic underlying EPS has been restated from 51.2p to 52.9p following a review of the calculation of EPS.
The Committee re-calculated the performance out-turn for the 2013 LTIP using the re-stated 2015 EPS figure, and as a result, the vesting will be adjusted from 49.27% reported last year to 61.79% of the Maximum.
The relevant disclosures in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration on page 82 have been adjusted accordingly.
Accordingly, the performance out-turn for the 2012 LTIP was also re-calculated on the same basis, however, the increase in vesting out-turn was considered immaterial.
Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report 2016 75 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE THE 2017 REMUNERATION POLICY - INTRODUCTION The 2017 Remuneration Policy is presented for approval at the 2017 AGM and will be effective from that date.
The full Remuneration Policy is provided below and will be available in the investor relations section of the Groups website, jlt.
The main changes in the Policy between 2014 and 2017 are: 1.
Greater clarity on the Annual Bonus parameters.
Our existing Policy states a Maximum bonus of 200% for all Executive Directors.
Under our new Policy, we will separate the Maximum for the Group Chief Executive which will remain at 200% of salary and other Executive Directors.
For other Executive Directors, the Target award will be increased to 125% of salary with a Maximum award of 150% of salary.
This represents a reduction in the Maximum bonus award, which may be payable under the existing Policy.
Flexibility for future LTIP performance measures.
The new Policy will allow future LTIP awards to include, if the Committee considers appropriate, additional performance measures to complement the current measure of EPS.
This may include measures which are used to drive and report performance internally, but which maintain alignment with the strategy and objectives communicated externally.
Whilst these will generally be financial metrics, there may be specific strategic objectives that will have other objective measures.
Should such measures be introduced, we would intend to consult major with investors at that time.
2017 REMUNERATION POLICY This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee in line with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code, Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended.
