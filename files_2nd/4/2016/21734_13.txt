Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2016, which sets out the remuneration paid to the Directors in the year ended 25 March 2016.
The Committees approach to remuneration remains that it should be kept as simple and comprehensible as possible.
As such, our Remuneration Policy remains unchanged since 2014.
The Remuneration Policy of the Company is intended to ensure: Incentives for Executive Directors and executives are closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of Executive Directors, executives and shareholders: Executive Directors rewards are correlated with those received by other employees of the business: and Executive Directors are not rewarded for failure.
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are aligned to growing long term shareholder value.
We are satisfied that the outcomes to date have reflected business performance and that the targets set are stretching in the context of the market in which we operate and, if delivered, will have added significant value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place are working well to support the Companys strategy and are helping to retain, recruit and motivate our management team.
In the context of our future performance goals the Committee reviewed and decided to maintain the stretching targets attached to PSP awards granted in 2015, which require the executive team to deliver for three years compound annual growth in earnings per share of 12% and compound annual growth in total shareholder return of 15% in order to secure the maximum PSP vesting.
In that context, we were keen to ensure that remuneration was weighted towards variable pay, dependent on performance, thus ensuring a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the amount paid to our Executive Directors.
As a result, we reviewed the size of awards and decided to increase the award potentially payable to Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson to 200% of salary.
As a result of major changes in the roles and responsibilities of the Executive Directors following the acquisition of BRP, the departures of Mark Aylwin and Bryn Satherley, and a benchmarking exercise conducted by PwC confirming that a significant variance to the market had arisen in respect of the remuneration of Guy Farrant and Jonathan Prentis, the Committee, taking all those factors into account, found it necessary to reconsider and increase Executive Director salaries in 2016 by circa 5%.
In a similar vein, the appointment of a new Chairman and new Non-Executive Directors prompted a review of Chairman and NonExecutive Director fees.
We found our fee level was below the FTSE350 range and accordingly the Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees have been rebased to market levels.
No payments were made to Richard Rose on his retirement as Chairman and no payment for loss of office was made to Mark or Bryn following termination of their employment.
The Committee will review the existing Remuneration Policy and incentive framework over the next year prior to putting the next Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval in 2017.
As the Performance Share Plan expires in 2018 the Committee intends to review the plan as part of the overall review of remuneration and intends to put a new long-term incentive plan to shareholders for approval in 2017.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this years AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 18 May 2016.

The Committees overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages.
The Company wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality.
Accordingly, the Committees policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for their contribution.
The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Executive Directors remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.
Directors Remuneration Policy The policy for Executive Directors remuneration, set out below, took effect from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to view in the Investor Relations Investor Centre Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
42 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance The Committee considers the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Groups strategy.

45 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Notes to Future Policy Table Bonus The Earnings before interest and tax EBIT bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group.
The aggregate bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless there is an improvement.
The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company.
Payments to Executive Directors are based upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings.
The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors is less than 15%.
PSP The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period.
Awards are made annually and, other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011 14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based.
Details of structure and outcome are set out on page 55.
For the 2012 15, 2013 16 and 2014 17 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the Executive Directors.
Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum is calculated on a straight line basis, as follows: 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from the award date.
50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured between March 2012 and March 2015, March 2013 and March 2016 and March 2014 and March 2017.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The Committee will review the performance measures for the 2016 19 cycle for the Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson, in the context of our future performance goals.
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in any incentive schemes are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable at risk reward, linked to the performance of the Company.
Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus scheme and does not participate in the PSP.
The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant shareholding in the Company.

This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion The Committee will operate the Companys incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans.
These include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends.
The discretions that can be applied in the case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on Policy on Payment for Loss of Office on page 49.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors Remuneration Policy, to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Policy and the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are: salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate: participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of commencement of employment: and participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director excluding any awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors: Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary: and PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment up to a further 150% of salary.
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from a previous employment as a result of their resignation.
The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of performance achieved or likely to be achieved, the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award.
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive Director with Company performance.
48 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance Policy on Payment for Loss of Office Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months.
As an alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months pension contributions, and other contractual benefits.
Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss of office.
The Companys approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company.
A bonus element is not normally included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilsons contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his employment on 30 days notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period.
Termination by Mutual Agreement In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning and the development of the senior talent pipeline.
In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executives departure will be by mutual agreement.
In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession.
The Companys experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP plans.
If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan rules in respect of termination payments.
There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next Remuneration Report and will comply with the Companys overall remuneration policy aim that Directors should not be rewarded for failure.

1 Committee has discretion to pro-rate to a later date see below.
2 Committee has discretion to determine otherwise see below.
3 Committee has discretion to accelerate vesting see below.
The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to: whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited: and the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest.
The Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the PSP.
In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Directors departure including, but not restricted to, whether the Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company.
If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters.
Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and with shareholder representative organisations over the year.
50 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance Legacy Arrangements The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of those payments were i entered into with current or former directors before this policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with the terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining remuneration for its Executive Directors.
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark policy level while they become established in role.
In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job.
The Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors remuneration.
While formal comparison measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees The Companys policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees.
This group of approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme.
Eligibility to participate in the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees group, the composition of remuneration differs.
Of the Groups average 13,000 employees, over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service.
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency targets at the site at which they are employed.
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and other factors.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors The Committees policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments will have 12 month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM.
51 Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Details of Current Executive Directors Contracts The table below summarises the service contracts of the Executive Directors.

All Executive Directors will stand for re-election at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.
External Appointments Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors The policy for Non-Executive Directors applies for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM, and is available to view in the Investor Relations Legal Documents section of the Groups website.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the Companys share schemes.

An additional fee is paid for acting as chairman of a committee and for representation on a committee.
52 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum.
The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out in the relevant Non-Executive Directors letter of appointment.
In practice, the Non-Executive Directors exceed the minimum time commitment through their involvement in all aspects of the business.
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company.
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years subject to termination on one months notice.
In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

Taxable benefits all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individuals employment in 2015 2016.
Bonus the bonus relating to the Companys performance in the year ended 25 March 2016, to be paid in July 2016.
PSP exercised during the year based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
Pension Benefits the value of Company contributions to pension plans or any cash allowances paid in lieu of pension contributions.
All Executive Directors receive a cash allowance and none are members of a defined benefit pension scheme operated by the Group.
No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company during the year.
Salary audited information Notwithstanding the review of Executive Director salaries conducted by the Committee in 2015, the Committee found it necessary to reconsider Executive Director salaries in 2016 as a result of major changes in the roles and responsibilities of the Executive Directors following the acquisition of Budgens and Londis and the departures of Mark Aylwin and Bryn Satherley, and a significant variance to the market having arisen.
As a consequence, the Committee requested that PwC undertake a benchmarking exercise based on a company with a market capitalisation of 2.6 bn.
Based on that benchmarking information, the Committee approved salary increases of circa 5% for each of the Executive Directors excluding Charles Wilson.
Whilst these increases are significant, the Committee considers that the increases are fully necessary to ensure the Company continues to prosper in a challenging trading environment.
Bonus audited information The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax EBIT achieved in 2016 gave rise to the following awards to the Executive Directors: 54 Financial Statements Strategic Report Governance Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Governance Director EBIT award as % of salary Jonathan Prentis 48.25% Guy Farrant 48.25% Bryn Satherley 48.25% The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,600 colleagues, including the Executive Directors other than Charles Wilson.
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year.
The Group EBIT increase before exceptional items of 14.8m to 155.1m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 48.25% of salary.
The maximum bonus payable under the scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded 185m, an uplift on prior year of 46.05m.
If EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid.
Bonus is paid on basic salary as at 31 March each year.
The proportion of the total scheme bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors was less than 15%, in accordance with the Companys Directors Remuneration Policy.
Bonus payments awarded to each Executive Director, other than Charles Wilson who received no bonus, as a proportion of salary in the three previous financial years: Financial Year Bonus Payment 2015 51.98% 2014 61.20% 2013 55.26% Share Incentives audited information The performance measures for each three year PSP cycle are set by the Committee.

The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes.
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Groups policy of ensuring that the remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders.
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the equity value of the Company has increased from approximately 300m to over 3.1bn as at 18 May.
The value of the PSP options awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors Shareholdings audited information Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Groups remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders.
The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.
The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal and or spousal holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Directors annual base salary.
All of the Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines.
Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.

This is considered the most appropriate index against which to measure performance following the Companys inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index in December 2009.
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over a period of time.
Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares, it measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with any dividends paid.
