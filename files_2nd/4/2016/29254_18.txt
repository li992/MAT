This weighting recognizes the critical importance of financial results to our shareholders and bonus affordability as well as the important role that non-financial performance plays in the success and growth of the Company.
These measures are aligned with and support our four key strategic drivers for 2017 of Growth, Innovation, Efficiency and People.
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that disclosure could damage the Companys commercial interests.
However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next years Annual Report on Remuneration to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
Financial and non-financial targets are set at the start of the performance year and are approved by the Committee.
The Committee believes the 2017 targets are suitably challenging, relevant and measurable.

In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
The 2017 LTIP awards will continue to be tested against two independent measures at the end of a three-year performance period: 50percent Product Sales targets and 50percent Non GAAP EBITDA targets.
The Committee will also use a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin at the end of the performance period to ensure vesting levels reflect the sustainability of revenue and profit growth.
The performance period for the 2017 LTIP awards will span January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019.
The 2017 LTIP targets for Product sales and Non GAAP EBITDA are based off the Companys Long-Range Plan and are considered appropriately challenging by the Committee.
In setting the level of the ROIC underpin, the Remuneration Committee has taken on board views expressed by shareholders as part of the 2016 consultation and the projected financial performance of the business.
The ROIC underpin has therefore been set as a sliding scale.
The threshold of the sliding scale ROIC underpin has been set at 7.5percent with an associated 25percent payout of the funded award earned based on the achievement of the Product Sales and EBITDA performance metrics.
The maximum of the sliding scale ROIC underpin is 8.5percent which results in 100percent payout of the funded award base on the achievement of the Product Sales and EBITDA performance metrics.
The vesting level of payout levels between the minimum and maximum levels of ROIC underpin will be calculated based on a straight-line interpolation.
The performance targets and ROIC underpin range for the 2017 LTIP award are set out below.
Performance targets for 2017 LTIP Threshold 25% Maximum 100% $16,000m Product Sales $18,000m 1 $7,510m Non GAAP EBITDA $8,750m 2 7.5% Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin 8.5% 1 For a reconciliation of Non GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measure under US GAAP, see pages 185 to 187.
2 Any outcome of the Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA measure may only pay out to the extent that the Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC sliding scale underpin isachieved.
Clawback and malus arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event of serious misconduct.
Chairman and Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy 2017 fee levels for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors remain unchanged for the third year since 2015.

The result is Shire Annual Report 2016 93 Other information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Directors remuneration report continued The summary table of 2016 remuneration for the Executive Directors comprises a number of key components which are set out in further detail in the relevant sections that follow.
All figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand.
1 In the 2015 DRR, the vesting value of Dr. Ornkovs long-term incentives was calculated using the average share price over the last quarter of 2015 of $207.85 per the relevant UK regulations.
2 Jeff Poulton was appointed to the Board of Shire on April 29, 2015.
His 2015 remuneration represents the remuneration he received following his appointment.
Base salary Dr. Ornskovs base salary of $1,688,000 remains unchanged from 2015, following the Committees decision to freeze his salary for a period of three years effective July 1, 2015.
Mr. Poultons base salary was increased by 3percent from $575,000 to $592,000 effective April 1, 2016.
Retirement benefits Dr. Ornskov received a contribution at a rate of 30percent of his base salary through a combination of contributions to the Companys 401 k Plan and credits to his SERP account.
Mr. Poulton received a contribution at a rate of 25percent of his base salary through a combination of contributions to the Companys 401 k Plan and credits to his SERP account.
Other benefits The 2016 figures for Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Poulton principally include car allowance, financial and tax advisory support, long-term disability and life insurance and private medical, dental and vision cover.
In addition, the 2016 figure for Dr. Ornskov includes costs of $521,464 associated with the relocation of Dr. Ornskovs family to join him in Boston following his permanent move to the U. S. in his capacity as CEO.
The amount includes the grossed-up cost of tax paid by the Company on behalf of the CEO.
Short-term incentives 2016 EAI outcome CEO 88% of maximum opportunity 2015: 100% CFO 88% of maximum opportunity 2015: 66% In determining EAI awards for the Executive Directors, the The 2016 EAI outcome of 88% of the maximum opportunity Committee considers performance against each of the for both the CEO and CFO reflects the strong performance of financial and non-financial performance measures within the business over the year and excellent personal contribution Shires Corporate Scorecard, as well as individual to the delivery key strategic goals, both before and after the performance during the year.
The Corporate Scorecard outcome is calculated by way of a weighted average of the outcomes of the financial and non-financial performance measures.
For each performance measure, outperformance or underperformance is measured as a percentage achievement against the target.
Performance at target results in 100percent of the target bonus with up to a maximum of 200percent of the target bonus for maximum performance.
Maximum performance is set at 20percent above target and so the Committee considers the target ranges to be very challenging.
Achievement of threshold performance results in 25percent of target performance.
The Corporate Scorecard outcome determines the bonus funding for all individuals within the plan.
In addition to the Corporate Scorecard, the Committee takes into consideration the individual performance of the Executive Directors indetermining their final EAI payout.
Shire has four individual performance ratings: Does Not Meet expectations, Meets Sometimes, Consistently Meets expectations and Consistently Exceed expectations.
The Committee determined both the CEO and CFO have delivered extraordinary leadership of the business and performed extremely well against the objectives set for each of them in 2016 and were accordingly rated Consistently Exceeds.
Given the 127.21percent corporate funding level under the Scorecard, any annual incentive 94 Shire Annual Report 2016 plan eligible employee at Shire rated Consistently Exceeds would be awarded a potential annual incentives award for 2016 within the range 150percent to 200percent of target bonus.
The Committee determined that since the Executive Directors were both rated Consistently Exceeds, it was appropriate to award the midpoint of the potential range and, as such, both Executive Directors received anEAI award of 175percent of target, which is equal to 158percent of salary for the CEO and 140percent for the CFO.
Approach to EAI assessment following Baxalta transaction The Committee met in May 2016 to discuss the approach to performance assessment given the acquisition of Baxalta which was finalized during the performance year.
The transformational nature of the acquisition meant that the performance targets set at the start ofthe year would no longer be appropriate following the acquisition.
It was agreed that, for financial metrics, separate performance targets would be assessed for the six-month periods preand postthe acquisition.
An average of the outcome under the two sets of performance targets would then be taken as the overall outcome under the financial metrics portion of the 2016 Corporate Scorecard.
The performance metrics themselves Net Product Sales, Non GAAP EBITA and Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC were unchanged over the two periods of assessment.
The non-financial elements of the Corporate Scorecard were considered to remain appropriate following the acquisition of Baxalta and sowere unchanged following the acquisition.
The outcomes against these at the end of the 2016 year have therefore been considered across the full 12 months by the Committee.
Corporate Scorecard outcome The table below sets out the achievement against the targets in the Corporate Scorecard the outcomes for the period preand postacquisition of Baxalta are shown separately, as is the overall combined outcome.
The weighted average outcome of the Corporate Scorecard is 127.21percent of the target bonus.

In addition, it was noted that both Executive Directors had achieved significant accomplishments beyond their objectives details of which are set out below.
As such, they were rated Consistently Exceeds which, given the Corporate Scorecard outcome of 127.21percent, generated a potential payout range of 150percent to 200percent of target bonus.
Based on the Executives performance over the year, the Committee therefore determined it appropriate to award the midpoint of the potential range and both individuals will therefore receive a bonus 175percent of target.
Summary of individual performance against pre-determined objectives In addition to strong corporate performance against individual objectives, the following additional accomplishments were achieved: Closed and began the integration of Baxalta, the largest transaction in Shires history, while maintaining business and supply continuity, delivering on our 2016 Corporate Scorecard and 2016 year-end guidance.

2014 Performance Matrix performance period ended on December 31, 2016 The 2014 PSP awards were assessed against a performance matrix that measured Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC performance and Non GAAP EBITDA growth over the three-year performance period.
For Non GAAP EBITDA growth, the Non GAAP EBITDA in the final performance year 2016 was compared to the Non GAAP EBITDA in the reference year 2013.
A compound annual growth rate of Non GAAP EBITDA was then calculated.
For Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC, the Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC in the final performance year 2016 was compared to the Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC in the reference year 2013.
The change in these two numbers was then divided by three and expressed in basis points one hundredth of a percentage point to give an average per annum change in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC basis points.
The Committee considered the impact of Baxalta on the 2014 PSP award and determined for this award that it was appropriate to exclude the impact of Baxalta from the final performance outcome on the basis the award only had six-months left following the transaction until the end of the performance period.
Therefore the PSP has been assessed against the original targets excluding the impact of Baxalta as well as other acquisitions that occurred during the period, details of which are set out below.
Non GAAP EBITDA of 15.9percent CAGR and a 54 bp p. a. increase in Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC between 2013 and 2016 was achieved.
In determining the vesting multiplier under the matrix, the Committee rounds to the closest point on the matrix.
This results in avesting multiplier of 4.0x, meaning that 100percent of the total award made will vest.

In respect of the 2014 PSP awards, the Committee carried out a comprehensive review of potential Significant Adjusting Events SAEs against pre-existing guidelines and determined that the following SAEs should be taken into account in the overall assessment of performance over the performance period also shown in the accompanying timeline given that they were not anticipated when the original 2014 PSP targets were set: a NPS acquisition to exclude the impact of the acquisition of NPS which had a short-term negative impact on Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC performance in 2015 and 2016.
This acquisition was completed in February 2015 and was not considered in the 2014 performance matrix.
Under the acquisition, Shire acquired two commercial assets.
One asset GATTEX which was launched at the end of 2013 and another Natpara that was launched Q2 2015.
Both assets are early in their lifecycle and thus have much room for growth.
Given the early commercial stage of both assets, the ROIC on this transaction will reduce Shires overall ROIC in the near term but we expect it will enhance Shires overall ROIC over the coming years as we continue to drive the successful commercialization of both Gattex and Natpara over the longer term.
b Dyax acquisition to exclude the impact of the acquisition of Dyax which had a short-term negative impact on Non GAAP adjusted ROIC performance in 2016.
This acquisition was completed in January 2016 and was not considered in the 2014 performance matrix.
The key asset acquired in this deal was SHP643 formerly DX-2930 which is a Phase 3 potential best in class prophylaxis HAE product that could secure Shires leadership position in HAE to 2030 and beyond.
Given that Shire will be investing in this Phase 3 program asset over the next several years and does not anticipate an approval launch of this product until 2018, subject to regulatory approval, the transaction will reduce Shires overall ROIC in the near term until post launch of SHP643.
The Phase 3 program for SHP643 is progressing as planned per our deal model assumptions.
c Ba xalta acquisition the approach for Baxalta for this award formed part of a comprehensive consultation exercise with shareholders who were all supportive of adjusting the 2014 outcome to exclude Baxalta from the performance assessment given that 80percent of the performance period for this award had already passed at the time the acquisition of Baxalta was completed.
The 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards have been adjusted to include Baxaltas performance given the much more significant amount of the performance period which remained at the time the acquisition was completed.
Full details on these revised targets are set out on pages 85 and 86.

This is because the key asset of Dyax SHP 643, formerly DX-2930 was not generating revenue at the point of acquisition.
However, if the drug is approved and is successful it has the potential to provide significant benefits to patients and secure Shires leadership in HAE drugs until 2030.
Therefore the acquisition was made with a long-term revenue generation view.
The business anticipates an upward ROIC trajectory over the coming years as the benefits from the Dyax acquisition and the NPS and Baxalta acquisitions are realized with ROIC.
c Other audited disclosures Scheme interests awarded during 2016 subject to audit 2016 LTIP awards The following tables set out details of the SAR and PSU awards granted to the Executive Directors under the LTIP during 2016.
Vesting of the 2016 LTIP awards will be determined by the Committee taking into account performance over the performance period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.
In addition, any Significant Adjusting Events that are relevant will be taken into consideration, as well as an overall assessment of the underlying performance of the Company.

Revised performance targets for in-flight LTIP awards In light of the acquisition of Baxalta, and following further consultation with our largest shareholders, the Committee revised the performance targets for LTIP awards made in 2015 and 2016.
In determining the revised targets for the Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA measures for the 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards, the Committee took into account both the original targets set at the start of the performance period and disclosed within the 2014 and 2015 Remuneration Reports and the Long-Range Plan, which builds on the most up-to-date performance expectations for the combined business, including Baxalta.
In order to determine that the revised targets remained equally stretching to achieve as the original targets, the Committee reviewed the amended performance ranges against current consensus forecasts available at the time.
The 2015 targets were also updated to include the performance expected from the NPS and Dyax acquisitions these were not included in the original 2015 target setting as theacquisitions occurred after the original targets were set.
The need to reduce the ROIC underpin for the 2015 and 2016 awards to 7.75percent was accepted by the majority of shareholders since a short to medium downward impact on ROIC was inevitable in light of the increase in our invested capital following the recent Baxalta, NPS and Dyax acquisitions.

Directors shareholdings and scheme interests subject to audit The CEO, CFO and other members of the Executive Committee are required to own shares in the Company equivalent to 200percent, 150percent and 100percent of base salary, respectively, within a five-year period following their appointment.
All shares beneficially owned by an executive or deferred under the EAI count towards achieving these guidelines.
The Committee reviews share ownership levels annually for this group.
Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below and show that the shareholding guideline for the CEO has been significantly exceeded, thus demonstrating his alignment with shareholder interests.
The CFO is relatively new in role and so has not yet met the requirement but has a three further years in which to do so.

6 Mr. Poultons shareholding has been rounded up to the nearest whole ADS, with his precise shareholding including a fractional entitlement to an ADS resultant of the operation of a dividend reinvestment plan.
Awards under the Companys long-term incentive plans and broad-based share plans are satisfied either by market purchased shares which are held in an employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved.
These limits comply with the Investment Associations guidelines which require that no more than 10percent of a companys issued share capital be issued in accordance with all employee share plans in any 10-year period, with no more than 5percent issued in accordance with discretionary employee share plans.
The number of ADSs over which PSU, RSU and SAR awards are granted is calculated using the average three-day closing mid-market ADS price at the time of grant.
The number of ADSs in respect of which a RS award is granted is determined by the acquisition price per ADS at the time of grant.
Unless otherwise indicated, all awards are granted under the Shire Long-Term Incentive Plan or its predecessor plan: the Shire Portfolio Share Plan.
2 In accordance with the rules of the respective share plans, the vested PSU and RSU awards have been increased to reflect the dividends paid by Shire in the period from the date of grant to the date of vesting.
3 The maximum SAR and PSU awards are granted and, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, adjusted at the date of vesting.
Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSU awards granted in 2013 and 2014 are Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA targets within a performance matrix.
Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSU awards granted from 2015 onwards are Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA targets with a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin.
4 25percent of any outcome under the EAI is deferred into shares through the grant of Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Shares.
5 A two-year holding period will apply following the three-year vesting period for SAR and PSU awards granted from 2015 onwards.
On October 31, 2016, Dr. Ornskov exercised an option over 84 notional ADSs granted under the Shire Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan GESPP at an exercise price of $147.56 per ADS.
On November 1, 2016, Dr. Ornskov and Mr. Poulton were each granted an option over notional ADSs pursuant to the GESPP: each electing to save $480.77 per fortnight.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration The following table shows the percentage change in the base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of the CEO between the current and previous financial year compared to the average percentage change for all other employees.
Percentage change between 2015 to 2016 Short-term 1 Salary and fees Taxable benefits incentives 2 CEO 11% 958% 3% 3 All other employees 8% 15% 0% 1 Due to timing of the 2016 year-end process, the actual short-term incentive figures for all other employees had not been finalized by the date of this report.
Therefore, the 2016 short-term incentive figures represent target figures multiplied by the 2016 Corporate Bonus Modifier score approved by the Committee in early February, which represents the Companys best estimate of actual bonus outcomes.
2 Reflects the 2015 and 2016 remuneration for Flemming Ornskov as reported in the single total figure of remuneration table in Part 2 b.
3 Reflects the average change in remuneration for all other Legacy Shire employees globally that were annual bonus eligible.
To help minimize distortions in the underlying data, certain adjustments have been made.
In particular, the figures have been prepared on the basis of permanent employees who have been employed with the Company for the two preceding calendar years to provide for a consistent employee comparator group the figures therefore exclude Legacy Baxalta employees.
This approach is consistent with the disclosure presented in the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration.
CEO taxable benefits The above disclosure shows an increase in the CEOs taxable benefits of 958percent from 2015 to 2016.
This is due to the specific support that was provided to the CEO in relocating his family from Switzerland to Boston where he ispermanently based.
Therefore the benefit provision for 2016 is not typical and itis not intended that this support will be provided in futureyears.

Overall spend on pay increased by 9percent in 2016 reflecting a 16percent increase in the regular workforce in support of business growth andexpansion.
Non GAAP EBITDA increased 11percent in 2016 as a result of strong product sales growth, held back by increased investment in combined R&D and SG&A.
Shareholder distributions increased by 28percent in 2016 due to the significantly increased number of shares in issue following the acquisition of Baxalta combined with a 15percent growth in full-year dividend per share in U. S. Dollar terms.

As set out in the Chairmans letter, 2016 was a very busy year for the company and the Committee given the transaction with Baxalta and the two consultations held before and after the 2016 AGM: Remuneration Committee activities Approval of 2015 performance and remuneration decisions for the CEO, the CFO and the Executive Committee Revision of performance targets following the Baxalta transaction Overall Review of market trends for Chairman, CEO, CFO remuneration and Non-Executive Director remuneration Review of the 2016 year-end compensation process and budgets for all employees Review of preliminary 2016 performance and remuneration decisions for the CEO, CFO and the Executive Committee Assessment of Company performance against the 2015 annual bonus funding scorecard Short-term Approval of the 2016 Corporate Scorecard incentives Preliminary review of the proposed 2017 CorporateScorecard Approval of the 2016 performance measures for LTIP awards to Executive Directors Long-term Approval of annual offerings of Sharesave and incentives GESPP awards Consideration of potential SAEs in relation to outstanding LTIP performance cycles Approval of the 2016 DRR Regular updates on legislative, regulatory and corporate governance changes Consideration of trends in executive remuneration Governance and corporate governance developments Review of the CEO, CFO and the Executive Committees shareholdings Review of the Committees effectiveness Letter to shareholders in advance of 2016 AGM Consultation with shareholders in advance of 2016 AGM Letter to shareholders post 2016 AGM setting out the intention to consult over the summer Remuneration Committee agree approach to shareholder consultation exercise Shareholder Letter sent to shareholders setting out revised consultation incentive targets Initial consultation with shareholders on revised incentive targets Review of feedback received from shareholder consultation exercise Follow-up consultation with shareholders on proposed incentive targets 106 Shire Annual Report 2016 January 2016 February 2016 April 2016 May 2016 June 2016 July 2016 August 2016 September 2016 October 2016 December 2016 Statement of shareholder voting The graphic below shows how shareholders voted in respect of the remuneration report at the AGM held on April 28, 2016 and in prioryears.

As set out earlier in this report, the advisory vote to approve the Directors Remuneration Report was considerably lower than in previous years and therefore as the Remuneration Committee Chairman, I personally spent considerable time with the Companys largest shareholders over the course of the year to fully understand the concerns of those that voted against the report.
The consultation confirmed that a significant number of shareholders who voted against the Remuneration Report in 2016 were focused on the lack of consultation over the salary increase awarded to the CEO in July 2015, and the quantum of the increase awarded without consultation.
Following these discussions, the Committee is confident that shareholders fully understand the reasons why the Committee was unable to conduct their usual full and extensive approach to shareholder consultation in 2015 with respect to the increase in the CEOs salary and while it does not change the outcome of the vote, shareholders recognize the communication restrictions placed on the Committee during the Baxalta pre-acquisition period.
The Committee in turn fully appreciates our shareholders concerns around quantum and has materially responded to this concern in reducing the LTIP grant to both of our Executive Directors to 575percent of salary for 2017 as set out on page 88.
Advisors In discharging its responsibilities in 2016, the Committee was materially assisted by those employees performing the roles of Chief Human Resources Officer and Group Vice President, Total Rewards.
In addition,  LLP PwC, appointed by the Committee, continued to serve as independent external advisor to the Committee following a competitive tendering process in early 2012.
PwC also provided global consultancy services to the Company in 2016, primarily in respect of tax matters.
Fees paid to PwC in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee totaled 399,990 in 2016 and were determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received by PwC in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was independent.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against any potential conflicts.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group which operates a code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

The remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the April 2015 AGM April 28, 2015 and will be effective for a period of three years.
Whilst there is currently no intention to revise the policy more frequently than every three years, the Committee will review the policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains strategically aligned and appropriately positioned against the market.
Where any change to policy is considered, the Committee will consult with major shareholders prior to submitting a revised policy for shareholder approval.
This section sets out the key parts of the remuneration policy.
The complete remuneration policy as approved by shareholders can be found within the 2014 Directors Remuneration Report available on the Companys website www.
The overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable, performance-related components, with a significant element of long-term variable pay given the long-term nature of the business.
In determining the positioning of overall remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration pay levels against a Global Biotech peer group and a U. S. BioPharma peer group.
These peer groups reflect the need for Shire to be aligned with the Biotech and BioPharma sectors in which the Company operates, the markets in which the Company competes for talent, and the geographies in which the Company operates.
In addition, the FTSE 50 excluding financial services is used as a secondary reference point, given Shires position as a UK-listed company.
The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivize undue risk-taking.

c Recruitment remuneration policy The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component.
Area Policy and operation Overall The Committees approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member of the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Directors remuneration package in their prior role, the market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment of the individual in question.
Fixed elements The salary level will be set with reference to the Companys Global Biotech and U. S. BioPharma peer groups, with a FTSE 50 excluding financial services group used as a secondary reference to ensure the positioning is appropriate.
Base salary, retirement and other benefits The Executive Director shall be eligible to participate in Shires employee benefit plans, including coverage under all executive and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including but not limited to, relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short-term incentives The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual incentive award in accordance with the rules and terms of Shires Deferred Bonus Plan.
The level of opportunity will be consistent with that stated in section a of this policy.
Long-term incentives The Executive Director will be eligible for performance based equity awards in accordance with the rules and terms of Shires Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The quantum will be consistent with that stated in section a of this policy.
Replacement awards The Committee will consider what replacement awards if any are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a new Executive Director in all circumstances.
This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation or benefits item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are not significantly more generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
In determining quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly equivalent value and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration forgone.
The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards which are not attributable to long-term incentives forgone will be delivered in Shire deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to continued employment.
If the Executive Directors prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was deemed forgone, the replacement payments shall be reduced by an equivalent amount.
Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Companys existing long-term incentive plan to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to their original terms.
If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top-up award may be made to bring the Executive Directors opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.
Shire Annual Report 2016 111 Other information Financial statements Governance Strategic report Directors remuneration report continued d Service contracts and termination arrangements Executive Directors The Committees policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below.
As an overriding principle, it is the Committees policy that there should be no element of reward for failure.
The Committees approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, performance, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Notice period The Committees policy is that Executive Directors service contracts should provide for a notice period of 12 months from the Company and the Executive Director.
The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination.
Flemming Ornskovs contract does not have a fixed term but provides for a notice period of 12 months in line with this policy.
His contract is dated October 24, 2012.
Contractual payments Executive Directors contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of payment in lieu of notice, at the Companys discretion.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payments in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months base salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits.
There is no contractual entitlement to annual incentive payments in respect of the notice period.
Any award is at the Committees absolute discretion, performance related and capped at the contractual target level.
Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors services are not required for the full 12 months of their notice period.
Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, which allow for further reduction in payments if the individual finds alternative employment outside of the Company during the notice period.
Retirement benefits Normal treatment to apply as governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan: no enhancement for leavers will be made.
Short-term incentives Where an Executive Directors employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made, the executive will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period.
Where an award is made the payment may be delivered fully in cash.
No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
Where an Executive Directors employment is terminated during a performance year, a pro-rata annual incentive award for the period worked in that performance year may be payable subject to an assessment based on performance achieved over the period.
The Committees policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
The relevant plan rules provide that any outstanding deferred shares will vest in accordance with the regular vesting period, except for where an Executive Directors employment is terminated for cause in which case they will lapse.
In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class of stock or securities subject to the award.
Long-term incentives The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved by shareholders.
Where an individuals employment terminates, the LTIP rules provide for unvested long-term incentive awards to lapse except as set out below.
Under the LTIP rules, where an individual is determined to be a good leaver, unvested long-term incentive awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time.
Any Committee determination will take into account a number of considerations, in particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
Pro-rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which the executive was employed as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period.
Where an executive does not work during their notice period, the Committee may apply prorating by reference to the date the notice period would have expired.
Where an Executive Directors employment is terminated or an Executive Director is under notice of termination for any reason at the date of award of any long-term incentive awards, no long-term incentive awards will be made.
In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class of stocks or securities subject to the award and, in the case of an option, the option price.
Change in control In relation to unvested deferred annual bonus awards, the Deferred Bonus Plan rules provide that unvested awards will normally vest on a change in control.
In relation to unvested long-term incentive awards, the LTIP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and would be reduced where more than a year remains until the relevant vesting date, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
The Committees policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as a result of change in control.
112 Shire Annual Report 2016 External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to hold one fee-paying external non-executive directorship, subject to prior approval by the Board.
Any fees received from such appointments are retained by the Executive Director.
During 2016, there were no external fee-paying nonexecutive directorships held by the Executive Directors.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years.
Their initial appointment and any subsequent re-appointment are subject to election, and thereafter annual re-election by shareholders.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office.
The Chairman and all Non-Executive Directors are subject to a three-month notice period.
All service contracts and letters of appointments will be available for viewing at the Companys 2017 AGM.
Shareholder engagement The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and is committed to ongoing dialogue with the Companys shareholder base, which has a significant transatlantic element.
This can take a variety of forms including meetings with major shareholders to consider significant potential changes to policy or specific issues of interest to particular shareholder groups, other dialogue to update shareholders and receive their feedback on planned refinements to arrangements, and annual voting on the DRR.
Remuneration of other employees The Committee recognizes that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement of the Companys strategy and ongoing performance.
When making remuneration decisions in respect of the Executive Directors, the Committee is sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the Company, in particular in relation to base salary decisions where the Committee considers the broader employee salary increase budget.
The Committee approves the overall annual bonus funding for the Company each year and has oversight over the grant of all LTIP awards across the Company.
In addition, annual performance for the Executive Directors is measured against the backdrop of the same corporate scorecard that is appropriately used to assess performance across the organization.
This assessment of corporate scorecard performance includes a review of Non GAAP EBITA, Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Product Sales, adjusted to exclude the impact of the annual bonus corporate modifier on the full year results.
Given Shires diverse employee base, employing approximately 24,000 people across 68 countries, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult with employees over the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
However, many of the Companys employees are shareholders through the Companys all-employee share plans, and are therefore able to express their views on director remuneration at each general meeting.
The Company also periodically carries out an employee engagement survey which provides employees the opportunity to feedback their views on a variety of employment related matters, including remuneration.
The diagram set out on the following page illustrates how our remuneration policy and arrangements reinforce the achievement of Shires success and ensures that executives and employees are focused on delivering the same core objectives.

In general, the proportion of variable remuneration in the total remuneration package increases with level of responsibility within theCompany.
