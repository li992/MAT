STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014 REMUNERATION POLICY SUMMARY OF 2014 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The 2014 Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 21 May 2014 and took effect from that date.
The summary policy table below is provided for reference, and covers elements of the policy that apply to all Directors.

Pension No Director receives pension contributions.
The Corporate Governance Code considers that the participation by a Non-Executive Director in a companys pension scheme could potentially affect the independence of that Non-Executive Director.
As Directors do not receive variable remuneration, there are no provisions in place to recover sums paid or withhold payments.
No Executive Directors were appointed, or served, on the Board in 2016.

Eligibility to participate in the LTIP is determined by the Committee each year on an individual basis and all members of the Executive Committee currently participate.
Awards are normally granted annually.
Directors are not eligible to participate.
Under the LTIP, participants are eligible to receive phantom share awards conditional rights to receive a cash payment by reference to a specified number of the Companys ordinary shares, which are paid in cash upon vesting based on the price of the Companys ordinary shares at the time of vesting.

The RSAs vest only if the relevant employee remains employed by the Group on the vesting date.
The PSAs vest subject to both the satisfaction of performance conditions and the relevant employee remaining employed by the Group on the vesting date.
The same performance criteria apply to all participants in the LTIP and are designed to link business objectives, shareholder value and senior management rewards.
PSAs reward performance over three years.
There is no additional holding period before these amounts are paid.
RSAs vest one-third in each year over a three-year period following grant of the award.
The number of PSAs and RSAs awarded to each member of the Executive Committee is calculated as a percentage of salary up to a limit of 200% of base salary or 325% of base salary if the Committee determines that exceptional circumstances apply.
The market value of shares in relation to which the award is to be granted is equal to the closing price on the dealing day before the grant, or, if the Committee determines, the average closing price during a period set by the Committee not exceeding five dealing days ending with the last dealing day before the grant.

Total shareholder return is calculated to show a theoretical change in the value of a shareholding over a specified period, assuming that dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date.
Total shareholder return for the Euromoney Global Mining Index is calculated by aggregating the returns of all individual constituents of that index and, for the purposes of comparison with the Companys share performance, taking an average of the index over three months before the beginning and the end of the period respectively.
Targets are calculated based on the Groups accumulated EBITDA over the period from 2014-2016, versus the 2014 budget figure and the Groups 2014 internal base case figures for 2015 and 2016.
The final calculation will not be adjusted for commodity price or exchange rate fluctuations.

The single figure remuneration for the Groups lead executive in 2014 comprises Jean-Paul Luksics remuneration until 1 September 2014 when he became Non-Executive Chairman and Diego Hernndezs remuneration from 1 September 2014 when he became Group CEO.
The Chairman was not eligible for variable remuneration and the 2014 percentage figures therefore only relate to the 2014 annual bonus and LTIP awards vesting for the Group CEO.
The 2015 figure has been restated an estimate was included in the 2015 Remuneration Report because these awards had not yet vested as at the date of that report.

The percentage change in annual bonus for the Group CEO is higher than for Group By order of the Board employees because under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan employees are entitled to their full annual bonus if their employment terminates during the last six months of the year.
Because Diego Hernndezs employment terminated in August TIM BAKER 2016, the element of Group CEO Annual Bonus attributable to Diego Hernndez is CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION AND TALENT therefore higher than for the equivalent period in 2015.

Mining division employees were chosen as the comparator group because the mining division accounts for more than 90% of the Groups revenue and the Annual Bonus Plan that applies to the Executive Committee is the same plan that applies to the mining division as a whole.

The Committee retains the discretion to provide additional insurance benefits in accordance with Company policy, should this be deemed necessary.
The Code considers that the participation by a Non-Executive Director in a companys pension scheme could potentially impact on the independence of that Non-Executive Director.
As Directors do not receive variable remuneration, there are no provisions in place to recover sums paid or to withhold payments made to Directors.
SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS The Company does not currently have shareholding guidelines or requirements for Directors.
However, Chairman Jean-Paul Luksic and Non-Executive Director Andrnico Luksic C are members of the Luksic family: members of the Luksic family are interested in the E. Abaroa Foundation which controls the Metalinvest Establishment and Kupferberg Establishment which, in aggregate, hold approximately 60.66% of the Companys ordinary shares and approximately 94.12% of the Companys preference shares.
In addition, Mr Jean-Paul Luksic controls the Severe Studere Foundation which in turn, controls Aureberg Establishment which holds approximately 4.26% of the Companys ordinary shares.
This creates significant alignment between these members of the Board and shareholders.
