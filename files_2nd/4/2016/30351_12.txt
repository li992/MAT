The Remuneration Committee Patrick fide Smedt sets targets each financial year which it judges to be suitably Chairman of the balanced between delivering performance over both the near and Remuneration longer term and which are appropriately stretching.
Committee Whilst recognising the overall progress which has been made in delivering certain strategic objectives for example, revenues in the Magma Oil and Gas mega-programme explained on page 13, in light of the financial performance, the Committee determined that no cash bonus would be paid.
A separate analysis of the relevant financial performance targets forthe Long Term Incentive Plan concluded that the targets had notbeen satisfied with the result that there would be no vesting.
There will be no increase in the basic salary of executive Directors for the 2017 financial year.

A significant proportion of the annual reward for our executive Directors is linked to a combination of the financial performance of Annual Report 2016 Victrex plc 51 Corporate governance Directors remuneration report continued Directors Remuneration Policy This part of the report sets out the Companys policy for the remuneration of executive and non-executive Directors referred to as either the Remuneration Policy or the Policy.
The Policy is determined by the Remuneration Committee and is not subject to audit by the external auditor.
The Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2014 expires.
The Committee has taken the opportunity over the past several months to undertake a thorough and detailed review of the existing Policy.
As a result of that review, the Committee is satisfied that, subject to only minor amendments, the Policy remains appropriate.
The revised Policy below includes these amendments and, for clarity, does not seek to increase any of the approved limits for any element of pay, other than a small change to align the Policy limits for the all employee plans with revised legislative limits.
Should shareholders approve the changes which are being sought at the 2017 AGM, the new Policy would be effective from the date of the AGM.
The Committee considers that the changes strengthen the link between Victrexs strategy and executive remuneration and increase alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders over the long term.
In considering the scope of these changes, the Committee undertook an engagement with major shareholders.
Changes are as follows: Pay element Current Policy New Policy No changes Salary No changes Benefits Maximum bonus 125% of salary No change to maximum bonus opportunity Annual Bonus u u Any bonus paid in excess of 100% of salary deferred 25% of any bonus earned mandatorily deferred into u u into ordinary shares in practice this was applied to ordinaryshares under normal circumstances for 3 years the CEO only forall executive Directors Bonus measured based on a combination of Group Bonus measured on a combination of Group profit before u u profit growth before tax and personal performance tax, strategic objectives and personal performance Maximum award of 150% of salary normal limit or No change to maximum awards Long Term Incentive u u 200% exceptional limit, for example in recruitment Plan in the form After the three-year performance period, a two-year holding u or retention ofequity period will normally apply After the three-year performance period, awards u Performance measured based on a combination of EPS and u vestin equal tranches at the end of 3, 4, and 5 years TSR, with the option to introduce one or more other from grant measures over the course of the Policy if deemed appropriate Performance measured based on a combination u ofEPS and TSR A number of plans are offered.

Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration opportunity, withmaximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of appropriately stretching performance targets based onmeasures that the Committee believes also reflects and takes account of the interests of shareholders.
Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting following the AGM.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Companys annual review of remuneration policy.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee seeks to engage directly with major shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the Remuneration Policy for example, this has been done in respect of the proposed changes to the Policy outlined above.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration see page 64.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases and remuneration for the executive Directors.
Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Companys senior executive remuneration policy to date, although the Committee will keep this under review and is mindful of wider practices on reward.
For example, as explained on page 51, reflecting the wider pay freeze for the 2017 financial year, the Committee determined not to increase the basic salary for any of the executive Directors.

2 The following differences exist between the Companys policy for the remuneration of executive Directors as set out above anditsapproach to the payment of employees generally: u A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity or zero bonus opportunity may apply to employees other than the executive Directors and certain senior executives.
u Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise provision of healthcare and company car benefits where required for the role or to meet market norms.
u The majority of employees participate in local defined contribution pension arrangements.
A small number of employees have retirement benefits held in a UK defined benefits scheme the UK DB Scheme.
The UK DB Scheme was closed to future accrual on31 March 2016.
No further employee or employer regular contributions are made to the UK DB Scheme.
All former UK DB Scheme members now participate in the UK DC scheme offered by the Company.
The Company continues to fund the trustee board which includes the on-going governance and investment activity required for the closed UK DB Scheme.
u Participation in the LTIP is limited to the executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible toparticipate in the Companys share option schemes.
In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of individuals.
They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on performance related pay.
3 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflects the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to the delivery of financial, strategic and specific individual objectives.
4 The performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial results against pre-determined targets and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
The TSR performance condition is monitored on the Companys behalf by Willis Towers Watson, whilst the Groups EPS is derived from the Groups published financial statements.
5 The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC requirements where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating totheoperation and administration of certain plans.
6 All employee share plans SAYE and SIP do not operate performance conditions.
Executive Directors do not participate in the Victrex 2005 and 2015 Executive Share Option Plans ESOP which are the primary share incentive arrangements for below Board executives.
7 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors Remuneration Policy, authority is given for the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors prior to the implementation and approval of this Policy such as the payment of a pension or the vesting exercise of past share awards, provided that any such commitments complied with the Remuneration Policy in effect at the time they were given.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the AnnualReport on Remuneration as they arise.
56 Victrex plc Annual Report 2016 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Policy continued Service contracts for executive Directors The service agreements of the executive Directors are not fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on twelve months notice and make provision, at the Boards discretion, for early termination by way of payment of salary in lieu of twelve months notice.
Incidental expenses may also be payable where appropriate.
In calculating the amount payable to a Director on termination of employment, the Board would take into account the commercial interests of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months Termination payment Up to 12 months salary Remuneration entitlements A bonus may be payable pro-rated where relevant and outstanding share awards may vest Change of control No executive Directors contract contains additional provisions in respect of change ofcontrol Approach to recruitment and promotions The remuneration package for a new executive Director i. e. basic salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentive awards would beset having regard to the terms of the Companys prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and would reflect the experience of the individual.
The salary for a new executive may be set below the normal market rate, with phased increases over the first few years, as the executive gains experience in their new role.
Annual bonus potential will be limited to 125% of salary and long-term incentives will be limited to150% of salary 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and therefore shareholders to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would where possible reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according toits terms.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and or incidental expenses asappropriate.
Approach to leavers Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the normal payout date.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Companys share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment under the 2009 LTIP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, good leaver status may be applied.
For good leavers, awards will normally vest on cessation, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and or to dis-apply time pro-rating.
The default treatment for deferred bonus awards is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, incertain good leaver circumstances as described under the 2009 LTIP above, awards will normally vest in full on the date of cessation unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise.
In the event of a compromise or settlement agreement, the Committee may make payments it considers reasonable in settlement ofpotential legal claims, e. g. unfair dismissal or where agreed under a settlement agreement.
This may include an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation and such reasonable reimbursement of feesforlegal and or tax advice in connection with such agreements and or costs of outplacement services.
Outside appointments The executive Directors may accept outside appointments, with prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do not negatively impact on the individuals ability to perform their duties at the Company.
Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or are remitted to the Company will be considered on a case by case basis.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated by either party on between 1 and 3 months notice and their appointment is reviewed annually.

The Company believes that this combination of financial, strategic and personal performance objectives reflects the strategic focus on Group profit while maintaining a measurement of progression against strategic milestones and personal contribution across key operational goals for the business.
The Committee will continue to run a thorough annual review of strategic and personal objectives to ensure they are measurable, robust and aligned with overall Group-wide objectives.
The bonus for personal and or strategic performance is payable only if, in the opinion of the Committee, underlying financial and operating performance of the business issufficient in that year to warrant payment.
25% of all paid bonuses will be deferred into shares for a period under normal circumstances of 3 years.
Pension arrangements Members of the UK pension scheme are entitled to life assurance cover of four times salary and a retirement pension subject to the scheme rules: if a member dies whilst in pensionable service, the value of the members retirement account will be used by the trustees to provide either or both a lump sum and a pension payable to dependents.
D R Hummel participates in a defined contribution scheme and a life assurance plan operated in respect of the Groups US employees.
TheGroups contribution to his pension scheme and associated salary supplement remain at 25% of salary.

None of the Directors are accruing pension benefits under defined benefit schemes 2015: none.
Long-term incentives The extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted for the 2016 17 financial year will vest, will be dependent on two independent performance conditions 25% determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR and 75% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three-year period, relative to the u constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and the EPS element of an award will vest in full if cumulative EPS exceeds 330 pence over the three-year period.
This element of the award u is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if cumulative EPS is 302 pence over the three year period and is reduced to nil if cumulative EPS over the period fails to exceed 302 pence.
