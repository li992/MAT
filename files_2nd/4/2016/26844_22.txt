68 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Directors remuneration report continued This Directors remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013.
The report also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules DTR.
In this report we describe how the principles relating to directors remuneration, as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 the Code, are applied in practice.
The Policy report This section of the report sets out the proposed Policy for the directors, which is being put to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM.
If approved, this Policy will be effective for a period of three years from the date of the 2017 AGM.
The Policy applicable for 2014, 2015 and 2016 can be viewed in the Directors remuneration reports for 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively.
Changes to Policy The Committee commenced its review of the remuneration Policy earlier in 2016, and consulted shareholders in Autumn 2016.
As a result of that consultation, the Committee discussed various matters in December 2016 and agreed certain changes should be made to the LTIP awards to executive directors during the life of the proposed Policy.
These changes are as follows: LTIP The Committee proposes to amend the rules of the LTIP subject to the approval of this Policy to apply a two-year post-vesting holding period to future awards.
It was agreed that two-year holding periods for executive directors are increasingly common and accepted 'best practice', and that a holding period further helps to ensure close alignment of executive director and shareholder interests.
LTIP The Committee proposes to replace the Return on Trading Assets ROTA performance measure subject to the approval of this Policy with a Return on Capital Employed ROCE performance measure to ensure the way executive directors' performance is measured aligns more directly to the performance of corporate acquisitions.
Executive Director Remuneration Policy Table Base salary Function To attract and retain talent by ensuring base salaries are competitive in the relevant talent market.
Operation Salary will be reviewed by the Committee annually, in February, with changes effective from 1 April of that year.
Salaries for the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
In deciding salary levels, the Committee considers personal performance including how the individual has helped to support the strategic objectives of the Group.
The Committee will also consider employment conditions and salary levels across the Group, prevailing market conditions, and market data for FTSE companies in similar industries and those with similar market capitalisation.
Salaries are paid to existing directors in GBP: however the Committee reserves the right to pay future and existing directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed.
Opportunity The percentage salary increases for executive directors will not exceed those of the wider workforce over the life of this Policy in the normal course of business.
Higher increases may be awarded i. e. in excess of the wider employee population in instances where, for example, there is a material change in the responsibility, size or complexity of the role, or if a new director was intentionally appointed on a below-market salary.
The Committee will provide the rationale for any such higher increases in the relevant years annual report on remuneration.
Performance None explicitly, but salaries are independently benchmarked periodically against FTSE companies in similar metrics industries and those with similar market capitalisation.
Personal performance is also taken into account when considering salary increases.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 69 Pension Function To provide post-retirement benefits for executive directors in a cost-efficient manner.
Operation The pension plans operated by the Group which executive directors are, or could be, members of are: Meggitt Pension Plan defined benefit pension plan, closed to new members.
Meggitt Workplace Savings Plan defined contribution personal pension scheme, open to new members.
Salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Opportunity New executive director external appointments since 2013 are eligible for a pension allowance of 25% of salary, payable either as a pension contribution up to any limit set in current regulations or, above such limits, in cash.
Where agreements have been made prior to the approval of the Policy approved by shareholders in 2014 2014 Policy which entitle an executive to receive a pension allowance higher than 25% of salary, pension allowances up to a maximum of 50% of salary will be paid.
Mr Young and Mr Green had agreements prior to the approval of the 2014 Policy which entitle them to receive a pension allowance of 50% of salary and this arrangement will continue for these directors during the life of the new proposed Policy.
metrics Benefits Function To provide non-cash benefits which are competitive in the market in which the executive director is employed.
Operation The Group may provide benefits including, but not limited to, a company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life assurance, a fuel allowance, a mobile phone, relocation costs and any other future benefits made available either to all employees globally or all employees in the region in which the executive director is employed.
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstances: eligibility and cost is reviewed periodically.
Benefits in respect of the year under review are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
It is not anticipated that the costs of benefits provided will increase significantly in the financial years over which this new proposed Policy will apply, although the Committee retains discretion to approve a higher cost in exceptional circumstances e. g. to facilitate recruitment, relocation, expatriation, etc.
or in circumstances where factors outside the Groups control have changed materially e. g. market increases in insurance costs.
metrics 70 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Directors remuneration report continued Annual bonus Short Term Incentive PlanSTIP Function To incentivise executive directors on delivering annual financial and personal targets.
Operation Performance measures, targets and weightings are set at the start of the year.
The performance period of the STIP is a financial year.
After the end of the financial year, to the extent that the performance criteria have been met, 75% of the STIP award is paid in cash to the director.
The remaining 25% of the award will be deferred into shares and released with no further performance conditions attached, and no matching shares provided after a further period of two years.
Under the STIP 2014 rules as approved by the Committee, the Committee may decide to apply malus and or clawback to STIP awards and deferred STIP awards to reduce the vesting of awards and or require repayment of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Companys or a Group members financial results for any period.
Deferred STIP awards may lapse in certain leaver circumstances.
Opportunity The STIP provides for a maximum award opportunity of up to 150% of salary in normal circumstances, with an on-target opportunity of 100% of salary and an opportunity of 50% of salary at threshold performance.
The Committee has discretion to make a STIP award of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. a substantial contract win which has a significant positive financial impact in the long term but which has no, or negative, short term financial impact.
Dividends accrue on unvested deferred STIP awards over the vesting period and are released on the vesting date.
Performance STIP awards are based on the achievement of financial and personal performance targets.
For the executive metrics directors, the STIP will be based on a combination of the financial performance of the Group and personal performance.
The relative weightings of the financial and personal elements for any STIP period, and the measures used to assess financial and non-financial performance, will be set by the Committee in its absolute discretion to align with the Groups operating and strategic priorities for that year.
However, the weighting for personal performance will not exceed one-third of the maximum STIP opportunity in any year.
The award for performance under each element of the STIP will be calculated independently.
The Committee has discretion to review the consistency of the pay-out of the financial and personal elements and adjust the total up or down within the levels specified above if it does not consider this to be a fair reflection of the underlying performance of the Group or the individual.
The personal performance element will typically be based on three to five objectives relevant to the executives role and performance in core competency areas, which are seven core skills specifically selected as critical for the Groups employees.
Details of the measures, weightings and targets applicable to the STIP for each year, including a description of how they were chosen and whether they were met, will be disclosed retrospectively in the annual report on remuneration for the following year subject to commercial sensitivity.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 71 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Function To align the interests of executive directors with shareholders in growing the value of the Group over the long term.
Operation Under the LTIP, executive directors are eligible to receive annual awards over Meggitt shares vesting after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Whilst it is the current intention that LTIP awards will be in the form of nil cost options, the LTIP provides, at the absolute discretion of the Committee, for awards of conditional shares, market value share options and phantom awards.
Under the LTIP 2014 rules, the Committee may decide to apply malus and or clawback to awards to reduce the vesting of awards and or require repayment of awards in the event of a review of the conduct, capability or performance of the director where there has been misconduct by the director or material misstatement of the Companys or a Group members financial results for any period.
LTIP awards made to executive directors over the life of the new proposed Policy will be subject to a two-year holding period after the three-year vesting period.
The rules of the LTIP will be amended to implement this.
Opportunity Executive directors will normally be eligible for annual LTIP awards of 220% of salary.
Awards up to a maximum of 300% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances e. g. to support the recruitment of a key executive or to recognise exceptional individual performance.
30% of an award will vest if performance against each performance condition is at threshold and 100% if each is at maximum, with straight line vesting in between.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award vests, on the vesting exercise date.
Performance Vesting of LTIP awards is subject to continued employment and performance against three measures, which are metrics intended to be as follows for awards made over the life of the new proposed Policy: Earnings per Share EPS : Return on Capital Employed ROCE : and Strategic goals typically but not always to be based on strategic priorities around execution, growth and innovation, which will be explained in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
The way these measures link to our KPIs can be seen on pages 34 to 37.
It is the intention that the weighting of the measures will be equal i. e. one third each but that the Committee will consider, and adjust if deemed appropriate, the weighting at the start of each LTIP cycle.
Awards made under the LTIP have a performance period of three financial years, starting from 1 January of the year in which the award is made and ending on 31 December of the third year.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse.
Vesting of the strategic element will also be subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with the underlying financial performance over the three-year period.
The measures and targets in operation for grants made under the LTIP, and which are not deemed commercially sensitive, are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration for the relevant year of grant.
Any  information on measures, targets and performance will be disclosed retrospectively.
Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan SIP Function To align the interests of employees and shareholders by encouraging all employees to own Meggitt shares.
Operation Sharesave SchemeAll employee scheme under which all UK employees including UK executive directors may save up to a maximum monthly savings limit over a period of three or five years.
Options under the Sharesave Scheme are granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market value of shares at the date of grant.
SIPAll employee scheme under which i all UK employees including UK executive directors may contribute up to a monthly maximum to purchase shares monthly from pre-tax pay: and ii all UK employees including UK executive directors may receive free shares up to an annual maximum value.
Opportunity Savings, contributions and free shares are capped at or below the legislative maximum for tax-qualifying approved share plans at the time UK employees are invited to participate.
metrics 72 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Directors remuneration report continued Notes to the Policy table The Committee is satisfied that the above Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
The Committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Payments from outstanding awards Outstanding awards are currently held by the directors under the Equity Participation Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Groups long term incentive plans which operated prior to the introduction of the LTIP in 2014.
These awards have all vested in accordance with the applicable performance conditions and are capable of exercise during the period over which this Policy applies.
The tables on pages 87 and 88 highlight outstanding and vested awards.
Approach to target setting and performance measureselection Performance measures have been selected to closely align with, and reinforce, Meggitts strategic priorities.
Targets applying to the STIP and LTIP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points, including the Groups strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Meggitt and its sector comparators, historical growth achieved by Meggitt and its sector comparators, market practice and external expectations for growth in Meggitts markets.
STIP The performance measures used in the STIP reflect financial targets for the year and non-financial performance objectives.
The Policy provides the Committee with flexibility to select appropriate measures on an annual basis.
STIP performance targets are set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular personal performance objectives and the economic environment in a given year.
For financial measures, target is based around the annual budget approved by the Board.
Prior to the start of the financial year, the Committee sets an appropriate performance range around target, which it considers provides an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
LTIP The vesting of LTIP awards to be made during the life of this Policy will be linked to EPS, ROCE and the achievement of long-term strategic goals.
EPS is considered by the Board to be the most important measure of Meggitts financial performance.
It is highly visible internally, is regularly monitored and reported, and is strongly motivational for participants.
EPS targets will continue to be set on a nominal cumulative pence basis to incentivise consistent performance and reflect the fact that Meggitts profits are generated to a large degree outside the UK and not significantly influenced by UK retail price inflation.
ROCE helps to balance the achievement of growth and returns.
The Committee believes ROCE is a good proxy for total shareholder return TSR which focuses executives on managing the balance sheet and Meggitts operational performance.
For executive directors, the use of ROCE targets reflects the fact that acquisition decisions come within the collective responsibility of the Board.
The Committee believes that the strategic goals component will help reinforce the realisation of the Groups strategy and the achievement of key non-financial and strategic goals over long product cycles which drive long-term value at Meggitt.
The element will typically comprise a scorecard of three-year targets across a maximum of three core strategic areas for the Group.
The Committee believes that this approach will enable it to reflect the Groups long-term nature and shifting strategic priorities in the LTIP to ensure executives interests remain closely aligned with those of our shareholders over time.
Specific measures and targets for each area will be developed and clearly defined at the start of each three-year cycle to balance leading and lagging indicators of performance.
Vesting of this element is subject to a discretionary assessment by the Committee of the extent to which achievement of the strategic objectives is consistent with Meggitts underlying financial performance over the performance period.
Remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as that for executive directors.
Annual salary reviews take into account personal performance, Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes: opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individuals role.
Senior executives are eligible for LTIP awards on similar terms as the executive directors except some of the performance conditions may vary, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and SIP on identical terms.
Share ownership guidelines The minimum shareholding guideline for executive directors are 300% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of base salary for each of the other executive directors.
There is no set time frame within which executive directors have to meet the guideline, however until they meet the guideline they are not permitted to sell more than 50% of the after-tax value of a vested share award.
The shareholding requirement ceases when a director leaves the Group.
Further information on the shareholding requirement is in the annual report on remuneration see page 86.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 73 Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-target and Maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the Policy, applied to 2017 base salaries and 2017 incentive opportunities.
Note that the LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual.

Details of the Policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Fees Function To attract and retain non-executive directors of the highest calibre with broad commercial and other experience relevant to the Group.
Operation Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 April each year.
The fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the Committee, while the fees for all other non-executive directors are reviewed by a committee of the Board formed of the executive directors.
Fees for the year under review and for the current year are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committee and to the Senior Independent Director, to reflect the additional time commitment of these roles.
Additional fees may also be paid to any non-executive director to cover the cost of attendance at meetings which take place outside their continent of residence.
In addition, non-executive directors are reimbursed for reasonable business-related expenses.
In deciding fee increases, the committees consider employment conditions and salary increases across the Group, and prevailing market conditions.
Currently, all fees are paid in GBP, however the committees reserve the right to pay future and existing nonexecutive directors in any other currency converted at the prevailing market rate when a change is agreed.
Opportunity Fee increases will be applied taking into account the outcome of the annual review.
The maximum aggregate annual fee for all non-executive directors including the Chairman as provided in the Companys Articles of Association is 1,000,000.

Initial salaries may be set below market and consideration given to phasing any increases over two or three years subject to development in the role.
Pension In line with the Policy, new appointees will be entitled to become members of the Meggitt N A Workplace Savings Plan defined contribution plan or receive a cash pension allowance of 25% of salary in lieu.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with the Policy, but only UK N A Sharesave SIP employees will be eligible to participate in all-employee share schemes.

Targets 200% in exceptional for the personal element will be tailored to the appointee.
circumstances LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on similar terms as other 220% of salary executive directors, as described in the Policy table.
300% in exceptional circumstances In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and levels, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Meggitt and its shareholders.
The Committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, i. e. over and above the approach outlined in the table above.
Any such compensatory awards will be made under existing share schemes, where appropriate, and will be subject to the normal performance conditions of those schemes.
The Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure buy-out awards differently to the structure described in the Policy table, exercising the discretion available under UKLA Listing Rule 9.4.
2 R where necessary to make a one-off award to an executive director in the context of recruitment.
In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
The value of any such buy-out will be fully disclosed.
Internal promotion Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the Policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed either in the RIS notification made at the time of appointment or in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the Policy as set out in the table on page 73.

On change of control, Mr Green may give notice to terminate his employment within six months of the event and upon such termination he shall become entitled to the liquidated damages payment summarised above.
External appointments held by executive directors The Board believes that the Group can benefit from experience gained when executive directors hold external non-executive directorships.
Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conflicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to deterioration in the individuals performance.
Details of external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the annual report on remuneration on page 86.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee does not consult with employees specifically on executive remuneration policy and framework but the Committee does review salary data from across the Group.
The Committee seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodiesincluding trade unions and works councilsas part of its broader employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Salary increases made elsewhere in the Group are amongst the data that the Committee considers in determining salaries for executive directors.
In making remuneration decisions for the executive directors, the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.

Further details of the 2016 STIP, including performance measures, actual performance and bonus payouts, can be found on page 78.
4 LTIP is calculated as the number of shares vesting based on certain performance measures and valued at the market value of the shares on the vesting date.
For 2016, the figure represents the actual vesting outcome of the 2014 award, for which the performance measures were based on EPS, ROTA and strategic measures.
Based on performance to 31 December 2016, the 2014 LTIP award will vest at 17.3%.
The market value of vested shares has been estimated using the average share price over the last quarter of 2016 of 457.18p.
This value will be trued up in next years Report to reflect the share price on the vesting date.

There is also a weighting applied to the outcome of performance against seven core competencies which are specific characteristics and behaviours in how executive directors performed their work and accomplished their goals collaboration, driving results, ensuring accountability, being resilient, situational adaptability, customer focus and decision quality.
The average of all ratings drives the STIP outcome, where 2 indicates expectations are partially met, 3 is fully met and 4 exceeds expectations.
In terms of personal performance conditions, the following is a summary of the conditions which applied in 2016 to each executive director: Mr Young: i achieve Customer Services & Support CSS revenue target and CSS implementation phase two working well: ii MPS launches, quality and delivery targets and improvement in operating profit cash from MPS: iii progress with AR&T and programme management against specific schedules: iv continue improvement in supply chain quality and delivery: and v financial performance of the 2015 composites businesses and progress with the integration programme.

Percentage change in CEO cash remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all executive employees.
We have selected our senior executive population for this comparison because it is considered to be the most relevant, due to the structure of total remuneration: most of our senior executives receive benefits under the same STIP and LTIP structure as our CEO.

Half of the executives received pay rises of up to 2%, with the other half receiving pay rises above 2% based on merit and change of responsibilities.
2 For benefits, this information is not collected for the executive employee population and is therefore estimated from asample of executive employees, using aconsistent set of employees.
3 The STIP for executive employees is calculated using the increase in the STIP payout to around 220 full-time executive employees using the same employee data set in 2015 and 2016.
The percentage change in the Chief Executives STIP payment between 2015 and 2016 would have been 50% if MrYoung had not voluntarily reduced his 2015 STIP payment by 25% as reported in our 2015 Directors remuneration report.

Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2017 Base salary, pension and benefits Base salaries are reviewed taking into account personal performance, employment conditions and salary levels across the Group and prevailing market conditions.
Base salaries were reviewed in early 2017 and, effective 1 April 2017, will be as follows: 2017 2016 000 % change 000 Mr S G Young 705 2.0 691 Mr D R Webb 467 2.0 458 Mr A Wood 460 0.0 460 Mr P E Green 377 2.0 369 The Committee periodically benchmarks executive director salaries against other FTSE companies of similar size, as well as a defined group of UK-listed industry comparators, comprising: BAE Systems, BBA Aviation, Cobham, Halma, IMI, Melrose, RollsRoyce, Rotork, Senior, Spectris, Spirax-Sarco, Ultra Electronics and Weir Group.
The Committee decided to award Mr Young, Mr Webb and Mr Green a 2% salary increase for 2017.
In agreeing these increases the Committee took into account average expected salary increases across the general workforce, industry benchmarks and broader retail inflation, as well as the performance of executive directors in 2016.
The agreed salary adjustments for the executive directors are lower than the expected increase across the general workforce.
Mr A Woods salary was set on appointment on 1 December 2016, in the context of salaries for other Chief Operating Officer roles and his extensive past experience in aerospace.
His salary was not reviewed for 2017 but he will be eligible for a salary increase in 2018, or sooner in the event his responsibilities change.
There were no changes in pension contribution rates or benefit provision.
2017 STIP measures STIP measures for 2017 are based on underlying operating profit one third, free cash flow one third and personal performance one third.
The STIP targets for 2017, together with details of whether they have been met, will be disclosed subject to commercial sensitivity in the 2017 Directors remuneration report.
STIP award opportunities will be in line with the Policy disclosed on page 70.
2017 STIP measures Underlying operating profit 33.3% Free cash flow 33.3% Personal performance 33.3% 84 MEGGITT PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 Directors remuneration report continued 2017 LTIP measures The executive directors will be granted awards under the LTIP, the vesting of which will be subject to the measures shown below.
EPS 33.3% Strategic Innovation Execution measures 11.1% 11.1% 33.3% Growth 11.1% ROTA 33.3% Measures chosen The measures used in our incentive plans continue to capture key aspects of our business strategy that will, if realised, create sustainable shareholder value over the longer term.
The underlying earnings per share measure has been included in the LTIP since inception in 2014.
Elsewhere in this report we have explained that subject to the proposed new Policy being approved at our AGM in April 2017, LTIP awards for executive directors from 2018 onwards will include ROCE as a measure instead of ROTA.
The strategic measures selected for inclusion in the 2017 LTIP have been selected because they are key drivers to accelerate operational performance and critical to the deployment of our key strategic goals.
Organic revenue growth has been included in the strategic measures since 2014.
For 2017, the Committee is introducing two new strategic measures inventory and gross margin.
The operating review which commenced late last year has determined that these measures are critical to improving our focus on margin and cost.
These new measures replace the separate quality and delivery targets, which are effectively covered by the metric relating to MPS launches as quality and delivery is a core part of MPS.
Programme management and innovation are our other strategic goals and these targets are set to measure our performance in successfully passing programme gate reviews and innovation programme milestones respectively.
Target setting For 2017 awards, the Committee has set performance measures for underlying EPS, ROTA, organic revenue growth and gross margin using a consistent method, with reference to actual performance in 2016 and the Groups budget for 2017.
For EPS, the Committee takes into account other external benchmarks such as analyst consensus EPS, and EPS ranges for comparator companies.
The organic growth range also takes into account external market trends.
The 2017 targets for ROTA start from a lower base than the 2016 targets because of the continuing organic investment in the business.
The targets for the 2017 LTIP award have been set in relation to these reference points and the 2016 outturn and are considered by the Committee to be appropriately stretching for the three-year cycle.
The inventory target is a 13-point target based on the end of month Group inventory value from December 2016 to December 2017, measured at constant currency.
A number of the strategic measures have agreed annual schedules, to ensure that the LTIP targets for these measures remain relevant and stretching over the entire three-year performance period.
Targets for these measures will be set as three sets of annual targets i. e. at the start of each year and measured over a 12-month period.
Therefore, some of the measures shown below are effective for year 1 of the 2017 LTIP award, year 2 of the 2016 LTIP award and year 3 of the 2015 LTIP award.
In determining the final vesting outcome at the end of each LTIP cycle, the Committee will consider performance over the three-year performance period for each strategic measure.
