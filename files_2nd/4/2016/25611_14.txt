James Fisher and Sons plc Directors remuneration report Annual statement Introduction by Malcolm Paul, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee On behalf of the Board, and the Remuneration Committee, which I chair, I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31December 2016.
Pay and performance in 2016 James Fisher delivered a strong performance in 2016.
The key performance measures for the 2016 financial year were as follows: Underlying profit before tax 45.8m 2015: 41.2m : and Underlying diluted earnings per share 76.3p 2015: 68.5p.
Each year the performance of the Executive Directors is assessed against a range of financial and personal objectives which are aligned with the delivery of the Groups strategy and objectives.
By incentivising and rewarding performance that delivers our objectives we ensure that pay is tied to performance and value delivered to shareholders.
The Executive Directors potential maximum level of bonus in 2016 was100% of base salary, with 70% based on meeting the Groups financial objectives and 30% based on individual achievement and personal objectives.
The Groups financial targets for the year ended 31December 2016 were achieved and this element of bonus was awarded in full.
Personal objectives were also met.
As a result a bonus of 100% of base salary was approved for Nick Henry and for Stuart Kilpatrick, of which 70% will be paid in cash and 30% in shares, which will be deferred for three years.
Awards under the LTIP granted in 2014 will vest in part on 6April 2017 having achieved 47.1% of the maximum earnings per share performance target over the three year performance period ended 31December 2016.
Awards under the ESOS granted in April 2014, which are subject to relative total shareholder return TSR targets over the three year performance period ending 9April 2017 are estimated to vest at 44.7% based on the calculations as at 31December 2016.
Further detail of the targets and achievement against them is set out in the Annual report on remuneration on pages 47 and 48.
2017 remuneration Annual pay awards across the Group are determined on a country and sectoral basis, to ensure that pay levels are fair and reect local market and industry conditions.
Individual merit awards are made where appropriate.
Average salary awards across our UK businesses therefore ranged between 0.7% and 6.4% for 2017.
Following a nil increase last year and reecting the strong performance by the Executive Directors and the Group in 2016, the Executive Directors have been awarded a 4.4% increase to base salaries for 2017.
All other elements of the Executive Directors remuneration packages will remain unchanged from 2016.
The annual bonus maximum opportunity and LTIP awards will be 100% and 125% of base salary respectively.
70% of the annual bonus will be determined by adjusted profit before tax targets and 30% on personal measures, with the LTIP awards being determined as to 70% by earnings per share targets and 30% by relative TSR.
The Executive Directors and the Chairman have reviewed the Non-Executive Director fee levels and the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the fee for the Chairman.
For 2017, increases will be made to the Chairmans fee, the Non-Executive Directors base Board fee, the Audit and Remuneration Committee Chair fee and the Senior Independent Directors fee.
These increases reect the increased complexity and time commitment required.
Further details are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
38 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Remuneration policy for 2017 The Companys remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM in April 2015 and the Committee considers it to still be appropriate.
Therefore, we will not be asking shareholders to vote on the policy at the 2017 AGM.
In summary, executive remuneration consists of a base salary, pension contribution, benefit provision and, subject to performance conditions, an annual bonus plan, part paid in cash and part deferred into shares, and shares awarded under an LTIP.
Incentive pay is subject to clawback and malus provisions and, post-vesting, Executive Directors are required to retain the net of tax shares awarded until they have satisfied the Companys share ownership guidelines.
The Committee considers that the remuneration policy is appropriate and that it satisfies the Committees objective to operate a remuneration structure which successfully promotes the long-term success of the Group and fully aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with those of our shareholders.
Shareholder feedback The Company will continue to engage and communicate with shareholders regarding the Companys remuneration policy and the Committee considers all feedback received as part of its annual policy review process.
I hope you will join me in supporting the resolutions in respect of this years Directors remuneration report at the AGM on 4May 2017.
Malcolm Paul Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 28February 2017 Annual Report and Accounts 2016 39 James Fisher and Sons plc Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy report Overview of Directors remuneration policy James Fisher and Sons plc operates in a competitive international environment.
To continue to compete successfully, the Committee considers that it is essential that the level of remuneration and benets achieves the objective of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the necessary high calibre of individuals at all levels of the business.
The Company therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all of its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
The remuneration strategy is designed not only to align with the Companys fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity, but also to support the Companys corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure with a timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees, with links to corporate performance is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can associate with, and are focused on, the attainment of the Companys strategic goals.
Accordingly the remuneration package for the Executive Directors is normally reviewed annually.
Where an Executive Directors responsibilities change during the course of a year, the Committee will consider whether a review is appropriate, outside of the annual process.
Executive remuneration reviews are based upon the following principles: Total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reect the competitive market in which the Company operates, and to provide a fair and attractive remuneration package: Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward.
The majority of the total remuneration package should be linked to the achievement of appropriate performance targets: and Executive Directors incentives should be aligned with the interests of shareholders.
This is achieved through setting performance targets to reward increase in shareholder value and through the Committees policy to encourage shareholding by Executive Directors.
How the Executive Directors remuneration policy relates to the wider Group The remuneration policy set out within this report provides an overview of the structure that operates for the senior executives in the Group.
Employees below executive level have a lower proportion of their total remuneration made up of incentive-based remuneration, with remuneration driven by market comparators and the impact of the role of the employee in question.
Long-term incentives are reserved for those judged as having the greatest potential to inuence the Groups earnings growth and share price performance.
While the Remuneration Committee considers pay and conditions across the workforce when reviewing and setting the Executive Director remuneration policy, the Committee does not consult with employees on this matter at the current time.
How shareholders views are taken into account The Committee takes an active interest in shareholder views on our remuneration policy and is mindful of the views of shareholders and other stakeholders.
Directors remuneration policy The table below summarises the components of reward for Executive Directors of James Fisher and Sons plc that will govern the Companys intentions as regards future payments.
The remuneration policy Policy set out in this report was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 30April 2015 and it is intended that it will continue to apply until the 2018 AGM.
Any commitments made by the Company prior to the approval and implementation of the Policy which were consistent with the policy in force at the time, can be honoured, even if they would not be consistent with the Policy prevailing when the commitment is fullled.

Notes: 1 The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus reect the Committees belief that any incentive compensation should be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of financial and personal objectives.
2 TSR and EPS performance conditions are selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery of long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of longterm value to shareholders.
The TSR performance condition is monitored by an independent advisor whilst EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
3 The Committee operates its share plans in accordance with the plan rules and the Listing Rules and the Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans e. g. treatment of awards for leavers, change of control, adjustments to performance targets.
4 Consistent with HMRC legislation, the all-employee arrangement does not have performance conditions.
5 In approving the Directors remuneration policy, authority was given to the Company to honour any past commitments entered into with current or former Directors including the vesting of share awards granted in the past.

Approach to recruitment New Executive Directors will be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and elements set out in the Directors remuneration policy table.
On-going incentive pay will be limited to: Maximum annual bonus of 100% of salary: Up to 200% of salary LTIP award: and Participation in the Sharesave.
For external appointments, the Committee may offer additional cash or share-based elements to replace deferred or incentive pay forfeited by an executive when leaving a previous employer.
It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments as soon as practicable following the appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its original terms.
In addition, any other on-going remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and incidental expenses as appropriate.
Loss of ofce The Committee has considered remuneration for Executive Directors leaving the Company and is committed to applying a consistent and equitable approach to ensure the Company is equitable but pays no more than necessary.
The loss of ofce policy is in line with market practice and will be dependent on whether deemed a good leaver or bad leaver.
The good leaver policy includes: payment in lieu of notice equal to one years basic salary or, if termination is part way through the notice period, the amount of salary relating to any unexpired notice to the date of termination.
There is an obligation on Directors to mitigate any loss which they may suffer if the Company terminates their service contract: bonus payments for the period worked may be made, subject to the original performance targets, at the discretion of the Committee.
Any such payments would be made on the normal payment date: vesting of share scheme awards is not automatic and the Committee retains the discretion to prevent awards from lapsing depending on the circumstances of the departure and the best interests of the Company.
Awards which do not lapse on cessation of employment may either vest at that time or on the normal vesting date.
These awards will usually be subject to time pro-rating to reect the unexpired portion of the performance period concerned.
Awards that are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that these conditions are satisfied: and Executive Directors will also be entitled to a payment in respect of accrued but untaken annual holiday entitlements on termination.
Good leaver reasons are death, injury, illness or disability, redundancy, retirement, transfer of business resulting in cessation of the individuals employment within the Group or change of control.
No compensation is paid for summary dismissal, save for any statutory entitlements.
