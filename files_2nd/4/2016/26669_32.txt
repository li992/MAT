58 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Variable pay Annual bonus With the exception of our pub managers, field-based sales and operations teams, all bonus arrangements within the Group have the same structure and payout mechanism, though the maximum potential award, expressed as a percentage of salary, varies between different employee groups.
Payments are calculated based upon achieving or exceeding pre-set targets for both Group profit and return on capital.
Sales and operations teams have additional elements within their bonus schemes linked to segmental and individual performance.
Bonuses to Executive Directors and the senior management team are based on performance against pre-set targets for both Group profit two thirds and return on capital one third.
2015 16 Executive Directors could earn a bonus equivalent to 50% of base salary for on-target performance.
Above this, the award increases on a linear basis up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
If the target performance is not achieved then there is a linear reduction in the award using the prior period performance as a base.
For Executive Directors, the bonus agreement includes the following additional conditions: Any bonus earned in excess of 40% of the maximum opportunity is payable in shares which are then deferred for a period of three years: Malus and clawback provisions apply and these are detailed in the Policy table.
The Directors consider that the future Group profit and return on capital targets are commercially sensitive matters as they provide competitors with insight into our business plans and expectations and therefore they should remain confidential to the Group.
However, the targets and actual performance for 2015 16 are set out below: 2015 16 Threshold Target Maximum Actual % of salary Underlying Group profit before taxation 91.5m 100.0m 108.5m 98.0m 25.5% Return on capital 10.8% 10.9% 11.0% 10.9% 16.7% Potential 42.2% Actual award 40.0% 2016 17 No changes are proposed to the annual bonus scheme for 2016 17 and the Committee will continue to disclose how the bonus payout delivered relates to performance against the targets on a retrospective basis.
Long-term incentives The value of long-term incentives included in the single figure table on page 58 comprises the value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of the financial period and the value of SAYE options granted in the period.
LTIP Vesting: LTIP awards granted in 2013 14 were subject to the achievement of the following metrics: Threshold On-target Maximum % Base at25% 50%vesting 100% vesting CROCCE 40% 10.8% Base 0.25% Base 0.5% Base 1.0% FCF 40% 300m Base 7.5% Base 15% Base 30% Relative TSR 20% Median Upper quintile There will be straight-line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance.
CROCCE Cash Return on Cash Capital Employed is based on the budget target for 2016.
The use of CROCCE removes any potential distortions from subjective decision on depreciation policy and asset revaluation.
FCF Free Cash Flow is set as a three-year cumulative amount based on the projections for 2014, 2015 and 2016.
The operating cash flow of the business is more closely aligned to operating performance than a simple leverage ratio and reflects the cash which is available to reinvest to increase returns, to pay down debt or to pay dividends.
Relative TSR Total Shareholder Return compared to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
The Remuneration Committee believe that a wider comparator group is a more robust and realistic way of measuring how shareholders value the Company.
The maximum award has been set at the upper quintile level recognising our commitment to ensuring there are demanding performance targets in place.
The weightings for each metric have been set to balance the direction of focus for management in its day-to-day operations with its ultimate responsibility to shareholders.
In order to maintain transparency, the Committee will disclose how the Group has performed against each metric following the end of the performance period.
The extent to which the LTIP awards granted in June 2014 vest will not be determined by the Committee until June 2017 which is the third anniversary of the date of grant.
For the purposes of the single figure, the 2014 LTIP is estimated to vest at 21% and the value included in the table has been calculated by multiplying the number of shares in respect of which the 2014 LTIP is estimated to vest by the average share price over the last quarter ofthe financial period ended 1 October 2016.
59 Marstons PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance: Directors Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Granted: LTIP awards granted during 2015 16 were as follows: % of award Percentage Number Face value vesting at ofsalary ofshares atgrant threshold Performance period Andrew Andrea 125% 278,995 413,749 25% Financial periods Peter Dalzell 125% 257,080 381,249 25% 2015 16 2017 18 Ralph Findlay 125% 447,572 663,749 25% Calculated using the mid-market share price at date of grant of 1.483.
The Committee reviewed the base numbers and performance conditions associated with each metric and agreed that they remain appropriate and challenging.
The Committee considered the base amounts to be sufficiently stretching without encouraging undue risk and so they remain unchanged.
Each award is also subject to a further underlying financial performance condition and will only vest if, in the opinion of the Committee, the prevailing financial performance of the Group in the period of vesting supports it.
Lapsed: in the single total figure of remuneration table for the period ended 3 October 2015 the estimated value of the 2012 13 LTIP award included was based on a vesting of 41.7%, which represented the best estimate at that time.
The Groups financial performance for the period was satisfactory but did not achieve all of its internal targets.
In considering the wider workforce and the beneficial impact of a Group-wide bonus, the Directors have proposed to waive their LTIP entitlement this year and, as a result, the Committee have exercised their discretion and withheld the LTIP vesting.
Future awards: it is intended to make awards under the LTIP in 2016 17 based on the same performance metrics as 2015 16.
SAYE For the period ended 3 October 2015 for Peter Dalzell, the long-term incentive value includes the value of SAYE options granted based on the fair value of the options at grant.
For the period ended 1 October 2016 for Andrew Andrea, the long-term incentive value includes the value of SAYE options granted based on the fair value of the options at grant.
