b All Directors received salary supplement allowance in lieu of contributions into the Groups pension scheme throughout the year.
No Director had any entitlement under thedefined benefit section of the pension scheme and no additional benefit was received as a result of early retirement.
c The annual bonus column shows 50 per cent of the total bonus contribution earned under the MIP Element A in respect of 2016 performance, and 50 per cent of the total value of Element B shares awarded which are deferred but are not subject to further performance conditions other than continued employment.
The remaining 50 per cent in respect of 2016 Element A is deferred into shares in the MIP account which are subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a further holding period.
The remaining 50 per cent of 2016 Element B shares is subject to performance and employment-based forfeiture for a 3-year deferred period.
These deferred elements will be disclosed in the LTIP column when the conditions are satisfied.
The deferred shares in relation to both Element A and Element B may change in value during the holding period depending on the Marshalls share price.
d The LTIP column shows the aggregate value of sums released from MIP or LTIP account balances from earlier years that are no longer subject to deferral and forfeiture risk based on performance in 2016. e The LTIP comprises the 2014 Performance Share Award under the 2005 LTIP.
Setting pay in context The following graphs illustrate the relationship between total expenditure on remuneration and other disbursements from profit over the past 3 years.
The 4 elements represent the most significant outgoings for the Company during the financial year.
In addition to staff pay and shareholder distributions, capital investment and taxation are shown for the following reasons: investment the Company's strategy is to increase capital investment to take advantage ofmarket demand and in order to ensure that the business grows in a sustainable manner with a corresponding long-term benefit for allstakeholders: and tax the Company is a UK taxpayer and feels that it is beneficial to demonstrate to all its stakeholders its total UK tax contribution.
Themost significant elements of the Companys UK tax contribution are VAT, employers NI, corporation tax, fuel duty and aggregates levy.
Asprofitability increases, corporation tax will also increase.
In 2016 the Group was re-accredited with the Fair Tax Mark.

TSRis defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
Marshalls plc was a constituent of the FTSE Small Cap Index for the period from January 2009 to August 2015 and became a constituent of the FTSE 250 in August 2015.
This chart shows the value at 31 December 2016 of100 invested in Marshalls plc on 1 January 2009 compared with the value of 100 invested in i the FTSE Small Cap Index and ii theFTSE250.
The other plotted points are the intervening financial year ends.
Marshalls TSR performance was 42 per cent better than theoverall performance of the FTSE Small Cap Index and 40 per cent better than the FTSE 250 in 2015.
CEO pay in the last 7 years This table shows how pay for the CEO role has changed in the last 7 years.
b The 2013 single figure is made up of the previous CEOs base salary and benefits up to 10 October 2013 and Martyn Coffeys proportionate entitlement to salary, benefits and annual bonus forhis period of service in 2013.
It also includes the various incentive payments that crystallised as a result of Graham Holden being agoodleaver by reason of retirement in 2013 see 2013 Remuneration Report for full details.
Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Marshalls plc 59 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Annual Remuneration Report continued Percentage change in CEOs remuneration The table below shows how the percentage change in the CEOs salary, benefits and bonus between 2015 and 2016 compares with thepercentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for the UK-based employees of the Group as a whole.
b The bonus is the non-deferred amount earned for the relevant year taken from the total remuneration table.
5 per cent increase was awarded to the workforce on 1 January 2016.
The table above shows, however, that the average salary per employee for 2016 saw an increase of1.3 per cent compared with the comparative for 2015.
This is due to reduced levels of overtime in the current year and specific variations relating to the impact and timing of leavers and new starters.
d The table above shows that the average bonus per employee decreased by 8.8 per cent in 2016 compared with the prior year.
This is due to a significant increase in the number of employees eligible for bonus schemes at lower salary grades in the current year and because sales bonus targets were not met in full in 2016, when they had been in 2015.
Outcomes of incentive schemes in 2016 audited This section explains how 2016 performance is reflected in rewards earned under the Companys incentive schemes.
Management Incentive Plan MIP The MIP incorporates: Element A, an annual bonus award carrying a maximum of 150 per cent of salary, of which 50 per cent must be deferred into shares orshare-linked units: and Element B, an award normally in the form of a nil-cost option to acquire shares, carrying a maximum of 100 per cent of salary, conditional oncontinued employment for 3 years from grant and 50 per cent of which is also subject to a financial condition over the 3-year period.
Element B shares must be held for a further 2 years after vesting.
Both awards depend on achievement of the performance conditions set by the Committee at the date of award.
The table below shows the2016 performance conditions and the extent to which they have been satisfied.
Percentage Percentage Percentage of maximum Percentage of salary of salary contribution based Minimum Maximum 2016 of target earned earned Measurement on measurement target target actual achieved Element A Element B EPS 75% 16.47p 18.94p 18.95p 100% 112.5% 75.0% Operating cash flow before restructuring costs 25% 47.2m 61.5m 57.9m 87.85% 32.9% 22.0% 95% customer service 20% deduction To match or improve on 2015 Both No No Non-financial targets if not met performance health and safety N A achieved 100% deduction deduction Performance conditions were set at the beginning of 2016 and the Committee took account of both internal budgets and external factors such as the market consensus of investors for the full year 2016.
During the year, cash flow from sales improved significantly and pre-tax profit grew by 30 per cent.
This performance meant that the stretching EPS target was met in full and the operating cash flow target set at the beginning of the year was 87.85 per cent achieved.
This resulted in a combined 96.96 per cent achievement against target.
The share price fell by 10 per cent during the year 31 December 2015: 325pence: 31 December 2016: 292.5 pence, which means the underlying value of share and share-linked awards from previous years decreased.
EPS EPS relates to our strategic objective to grow profits.
The Groups profit before tax increased by 30 per cent from 35.3 million to 46.0 million.
EPS improved by 32 per cent from 14.32 pence in 2015 to 18.95 pence in 2016.
EPS is measured using International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs based on the audited results of the Group and subject to the discretion of the Committee with regard to one-off items.
Operating cash flow Operating cash flow is relevant for measurement of cash flow and overall sustainability.
The Groups operating cash flow for the year ended 31December 2016 was close to the higher end of the target range set by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
60 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Additional performance conditions Our customers are at the heart of our business model, and our measurement of customer service uses factors such as product availability, on-time delivery performance and administrative and delivery accuracy to assess performance.
The Groups average customer service performance, assessed monthly, exceeded its minimum target of 95 per cent throughout 2016.
The Group also continued its excellent performance against its stated objective of keeping days lost to accidents to a minimum, by reference to the 2015 rate.
Days lost to accidents year on year actually reduced by a further 20 per cent.
Had these 2 targets not been met, the overall level of MIP award would have reduced by 20 per cent: the achievement of these measures means that no reduction factor will apply.

d If the actual EPS falls below the forfeiture threshold over the 3 years before vesting, 50 per cent of the balance of the award is forfeited.
Once Element B shares have vested, they must normally be held for a further 2 years.
Element B shares lapse on cessation of employment except in good leaver circumstances, in which case they vest on leaving and must be held for 2 years from the date of leaving.
2005 LTIP award: 2014 performance share awards The vesting of performance shares granted in 2014 under the 2005 LTIP is dependent on achievement of EPS and OCF growth targets over the2014, 2015 and 2016 financial years.

62 Marshalls plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following financial year 2017 continued Variable pay incentives Executive Directors will be granted performance awards under the MIP conditional upon achieving certain performance conditions in 2017.
The Committee has discretion under the Remuneration Policy to change the weightings of performance criteria to align with its priorities, including measures relating to performance on ESG issues.
Our strategic priorities for 2017 are focused on improving profit margins, growing our business and developing our brand, while also remaining innovative and operating sustainably with the highest standards of health, safety and social responsibility.
The Committee believes that EPS and the ratio of OCF to EBITDA are the most appropriate criteria for measuring achievement of our financial objectives and that a combination of financial and non-financial criteria avoids inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The weighting for the operation of 2017 awards under the MIP will be: EPS 75% OCF to EBITDA 25% Targets are set between a minimum 0 per cent and maximum 100 per cent range in each case, with on-target budget performance expected to deliver 70 per cent of maximum.
Additional non-financial performance conditions to reflect our focus on brand, customers and employees will apply: customer service must remain at or above 95 per cent : and health and safety incidence: the rate of accidents must not fall below an agreed threshold, benchmarked by reference to the base year 2015.
If they are not met, there is a reduction of award value earned by 10 per cent in relation to each of these additional conditions.
Element A awards have a forfeiture threshold set annually at the time of confirmation of the award.
If this is breached, 50 per cent of the deferred balance in a participants Element A MIP account is forfeited.
Element B awards also have a long-term financial underpin based on a minimum EPS threshold that must be maintained over the 3 years from the date of grant.
If this is breached, 50 per cent of the Element B award is forfeited.
Element B awards are granted after the end of the financial period by reference to which they have been earned and the underpin is set at the time of grant.
The measurement period under the MIP by reference to which these targets must be met will be the full financial year ending 31 December 2017.
It is the view of the Committee that the targets for the MIP are commercially sensitive as they are primarily related to budgeted future profit and debt levels in the Company and therefore their disclosure in advance is not in the interests of the Company or shareholders.
The Committee will, however, provide full retrospective disclosure to enable shareholders to judge the level of award against the targets set.
NonExecutive Directors The Board approved an increase in the fees of 2 per cent from 1 January 2017, in line with Executive Directors and UK employees.
Non-Executive Directors reclaim business expenses incurred in the performance of their duties retrospectively against duly presented invoices.
