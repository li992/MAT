There has been no change to the interests in the tables shown on this page between the end of the financial year and the date of this Report.
However, the column showing awards not subject to performance conditions do not include the deferred shares issued under the incentive scheme in 2016 even though these awards were actually made after the yearend.
Please see tables on the following pages for details of LTIP awards, deferred shares and Sharesave options.
3 Alison Brittain received two LTIP awards on joining the Company, each to the value of 175% of salary.
The performance conditions for the first of these awards are aligned to the awards made to other executives in 2014 and the second of the awards have performance conditions aligned to the awards made to other executives in 2015.
Although the awards were actually made on 11 December 2015, under the rules of the LTIP, the technical date of both awards is 1 March 2015 and the market price at award shown in the table above is therefore the price on 1 March 2015.
The price used to calculate the awards was the average Whitbread share price for the five business days immediately preceding Alison's first day of employment, which was 4,645.2 pence.
