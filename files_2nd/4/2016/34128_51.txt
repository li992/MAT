Policy on executive remuneration The policy of the Company is to ensure that the executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of high calibre and reward the Executive Directors for protecting and enhancing value for shareholders.
I am pleased that shareholders overwhelmingly approved the Directors Remuneration Policy the Policy put forward at the July 2015 AGM which aimed to achieve these objectives.
The remuneration decisions made by the Committee in the last year were informed by these principles and conformed with the Policy.
The Policy aims to provide: remuneration to the Directors which is fair to the Directors both generally and in the context of the remuneration of other staff of the Company and the returns to shareholders: and a balance of short and long term incentives which provide a strong link between reward and individual and Group performance to align the interests of the Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee believes that the success of the remuneration policy is reflected in the length of service, stability and strong performance of the Executive Director team.
Two of the Executive Directors were founders of the Company while the other two have been Executive Directors for 17 years and nine years respectively.
The Executive Directors have significant interests in the shares of the Company, each in excess of two times base salary which is the Companys shareholding guideline for Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors are interested in shares comprising approximately 9% of the share capital of the Company including unvested share incentives held.
The Committee will continue to carry out periodic reviews of the Policy to ensure its relevance in light of changes to the business and wider market and will seek shareholder approval for any amendments.
Having said that, the Committee does not intend to make any revisions at the 2016 AGM, to the Policy approved in 2015.
A summary of the approved Policy is provided in the Directors Remuneration Policy section of the Directors Remuneration Report and the full Policy is available online http: corporate.
