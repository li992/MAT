Long term incentive arrangements Introduction Centamin introduced a long term incentive scheme which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 18 May 2015.
The scheme was introduced to provide a suitable recruitment and retention tool for any new or promoted executives and incentivise executive directors and senior management.
The plan, which complies with best practice guidelines, is to provide a platform, as part of the remuneration policy, to be used to provide a long term reward tool for participants.
Summary of the restricted share plan RSP The RSP provides the right for the Company to grant awards to employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
103 Centamin plc Annual report 2016 DIRECTORS REPORT Eligibility Awards may be granted under the RSP to all persons who at the date at which the award is granted under the RSP are employees of the group, though at present it is envisaged that awards will be reserved for senior management in the group.
The remuneration committee decides to whom awards are granted, the number of ordinary shares falling under an award and the precise nature of the performance conditions.
No awards may be granted more than ten years after the date on which the RSP was adopted by the Company.
Granting of awards Awards may be granted under the RSP at any point during the 28 day period following adoption of the RSP, the 42 day period following the announcement of the annual, quarterly or half-year results of the Company or at any other period in which the directors of the Company deem that awards should be granted due to exceptional circumstances.
In no circumstances shall awards be made at a time when their grant would be prohibited by or in breach of any law, regulation with force of law, or rule of an investment exchange on which shares are listed or traded.
The shares to be transferred pursuant to vested awards may either be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or existing shares to be transferred pursuant to the Companys employee benefits trust, the trustees of which are Computershare Trustees Jersey Limited.
Anti-dilution The overall number of shares transferred or transferable pursuant to awards, when aggregated with all employee share plans and scheme limits operated by the Company dilutive shares cannot exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten-year rolling period when added to the dilutive shares.
The overall number of shares transferred or transferable pursuant to awards for the benefit of executives, when aggregated with all executive share plans operated by the Company executive dilutive shares cannot exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten-year rolling period when added to the executive dilutive shares.
For the purposes of these limits, treasury shares will count as newly issued shares where required by institutional investor guidelines.
Awards or other rights to acquire shares which have lapsed or have been renounced do not count towards this limit.
The aggregate market value of any award received by an award holder may not assessed on the value of the shares at the date of granting the award, exceed 150% of the award holders total remuneration as at the date of the grant of the award.
In circumstances that the remuneration committee determine as being exceptional, that limit may be increased to 250% for a particular award.
Award price Award holders are not required to make any payment to participate in the RSP and no price is payable by the award holders to enable shares to be transferred.
Exit events In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, winding up or compulsory acquisition of the Company, the vesting of an award may be accelerated.
A proportion of the shares subject to an award equivalent to the proportion of the vesting period which has passed at the date of the exit event rounded down to the nearest month shall vest, subject to the extent the performance conditions have been met, to be determined at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
In the event of an internal reorganisation of the group which results in a new holding company and where the shareholders of the new holding company, immediately after it has obtained control, are substantially the same as the shareholders of the Company, awards may not vest or lapse but will be replaced by new awards over shares in the new holding company.
Leavers Where an award holder leaves employment with the group, their award will immediately suspend and will lapse upon the expiry of 30 days from the date of leaving, unless the remuneration committee determines that the award holder should be entitled to retain their award.
Where the remuneration committee permits the leaver to retain their award, a proportion of the award will vest over a proportion of the award shares which is equivalent to the proportion of the vesting period which has passed at the date of leaving rounded down to the nearest month subject to the extent the performance conditions have been met, to be determined at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The resulting shares will be issued or transferred to the award holder on the date they would have received them, had they not left subject to the same transfer in two equal tranches.
An award granted under the RSP is not transferable.
Awards will also lapse if an award holder is declared bankrupt or attempts to assign their award.
Status of shares The shares acquired under the RSP will rank pari passu with the Companys issued ordinary shares.
Alteration If there is a variation of the share capital of the Company, including a rights issue, consolidation, sub-division or reduction of of awards share capital that effects the value of awards under the RSP, the remuneration committee may adjust the awards in a manner that they deem to be fair and reasonable.
Amendments The RSP may at any time, on the recommendation of the remuneration committee be amended or added to in any respect, to the RSP and provided that prior approval of the Company has been obtained in a general meeting for alterations or additions to the rules of assumption the RSP which are to the advantage of award holders in respect of the rules governing eligibility, entitlement to acquisition of of awards shares under an award, to whom awards can be granted, RSP limits and individual limits on participation and the adjustment of awards on a variation of share capital.
Awards granted under previous schemes operated by the Company may be assumed into, or satisfied under, the RSP.
Minor amendments to benefit the administration of the RSP, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for award holders or group companies would not require approval in a general meeting.
Malus claw This clause has been included so that an award holder who ceases to be an eligible employee for cause see definition below in back provision the period after the award has vested but before the settlement of the deferred shares i. e. during the two-year holding period shall immediately forfeit his her rights in the award from the date of cessation.
Cause is defined as ceasing to be an eligible employee by reason of dismissal for gross misconduct, fraud or materially adversely affecting the groups reputation.
