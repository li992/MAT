Recovery and withholding provisions may be applied as a result of misconduct, material misstatement or error in calculation of performance.
Awards subsequent to the grant but before the expiry of the holding period, may be reduced or an Executive Director may be required to repay an award at any time within three years of the date on which the award vests.
For the avoidance of doubt, by approval of the policy, authority has been given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Directors Remuneration Reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
The previous Remuneration Policy included the CIP which has been replaced by the new PSP.
Under the CIP, Executive Directors could defer a proportion of their bonus into shares and receive a performance based matching award for each deferred share.
The final CIP awards were made in March 2015.
Subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance targets, the final CIP awards will be fully vested and exercisable from 4 March 2020 until 4 March 2025.
Annual bonus performance measures are determined at the start of each year, based on the key business priorities for the year.
The majority will be based on clear financial targets, including a significant weighting on profit, as this is the primary indicator of our sustainable growth.
PSP performance metrics are determined at the time of grant.
Performance measures may include a measure of profitability such as EPS, capital return such as EVA or ROI and other measures of long-term success such as relative TSR.
These measures align with our long-term goal of value creation for shareholders through underlying financial growth and above-market returns.
As IWG operates in a number of geographies employee remuneration practices vary across the Group to reflect local market practice.
However, employee remuneration policies are based on the same broad principles.
Our primary objective in awarding variable pay is to drive achievement of results, according to role, and to recognise and reward excellent performance.
Accordingly, to account for variances in responsibilities, influence and seniority, incentive schemes are not uniform in approach.
In order to ensure that the remuneration policy achieves its intended aims, the Remuneration Committee retains discretion over the operation of certain elements of the variable pay policy.
This includes the discretion to adjust the annual bonus and PSP outcome if it is not considered to be reflective of the wider performance of IWG.
In addition the Committee may adjust elements of the Plans including but not limited to:  Participation:  The timing of the grant of award and or payment:  The size of an award up to plan limits and or payment:  Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control:  Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes:  Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and  The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
Should any such discretions be exercised, an explanation would be provided in the following Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to shareholder consultation as appropriate.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

Such an approach was followed in relation to the changes 2.
For the avoidance of doubt, by approval of the policy, authority has been given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former to policy for 2016.
Additionally, the Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to each annual general meeting directors such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Directors Remuneration alongside any views expressed during the year.
We actively engage with our largest shareholders and consider the range of views Reports.

Except in exceptional circumstances, the members of the Committee, including the Committee Chairman, attend the CIP which has been replaced by the new PSP.

The Committee also reviews the executive remuneration framework in the context of published shareholder guidelines.
53 52 IWG PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 53 Directors Remuneration report continued Approach to recruitment remuneration When determining the remuneration package for a newly appointed Executive Director, the Committee would seek to apply the following principles:  The package must be sufficiently competitive to facilitate the recruitment of individuals of the highest calibre and experience needed to shape and execute the Companys strategy.
At the same time, the Committee would seek to pay no more than necessary.
 The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of the appointment.
Salaries would reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and may but not necessarily be set at a level to allow future salary progression to reflect performance in role.
 The Committee may offer additional cash and or share based payments in the year of appointment when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and, therefore, shareholders.
Per the Remuneration Policy the maximum level of variable remuneration which may be awarded is 400% of salary of which 250% is permitted under the PSP under the exceptional circumstances limit and 150% under the annual bonus plan.
Performance conditions for variable pay in the year of appointment may be different to those applying to other Directors, which would be subject to stretching performance conditions.
 Where an individual forfeits remuneration at a previous employer as a result of appointment to the Company, the Committee may offer compensatory payments or awards to facilitate recruitment.
Such payments or awards could include cash as well as performance and  share awards, and would be in such form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into account all relevant factors such as the form, expected value, anticipated vesting and timing of the forfeited remuneration.
The aim of any such award would be to ensure that so far as possible, the expected value and structure of the award will be no more generous than the amount forfeited.
 Any share-based awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share plans.
If necessary, awards may be granted outside of these plans as permitted under the Listing Rules, and in line with the approach and the limits set out above.
 In the case of an internal appointment, variable pay awarded in respect of the incumbents prior role may pay out according to its terms of grant.
In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations prior to their appointment may continue, provided that they are put to shareholders for approval at the first annual general meeting following their appointment.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the Policy Table for Non-Executive Directors on page 53.
Service contracts Executive Directors have service contracts with the Group which can be terminated by the Company or the Director by giving 12 months notice.
This applies to current Executive Directors and would normally be applied as the policy for future appointments The Company may terminate employment of the Chief Executive by making a payment in lieu of notice which would not exceed 12 months salary.
Under the current service agreements Mark Dixons contract provides that, on a change of control he may terminate the contract by giving one months notice and will, in addition to contractual payments for the one-month notice period, receive a payment equal to 12 months salary, and remain eligible for a discretionary bonus.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term, which is renewable, with six months notice on either side, no contractual termination payments being due and subject to retirement pursuant to the Articles of Association at the annual general meeting.
Policy on payment for loss of office Where an Executive Director leaves employment, the Committees approach to determining any payment for loss of office will normally be based on the following principles:  The Committees objective is to find an outcome which is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, taking into account the specific circumstances, contractual obligations and seeking to pay no more than is warranted.
Payments in lieu of notice will not exceed 12 months salary and benefits.
 Treatment of annual bonus: There is no contractual right to receive an annual bonus in the year of termination.
However, the Committee has discretion for certain leavers to make a payment under the annual bonus.
This will reflect the period of service during the year and performance measured at the same time as performance for other plan participants, if feasible.
Should the Committee make a payment in these circumstances, the rationale would be set out in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
 Treatment of share plans: If an Executive Director leaves employment with the Company unvested PSP and deferred bonus shares will lapse unless the Committee in its absolute discretion determines otherwise for reasons including, amongst others, injury, disability, retirement, redundancy and death.
In such circumstances an Executive Directors award normally vests based on the time served and in the case of the PSP, achievement of performance criteria.
Should the Committee adjust the time pro-rating, then this would be explained in the following Annual Report on Remuneration.
If the Executive Director ceases to be an employee for any reason other than those specified above then the award shall lapse immediately on such cessation.

Per the Remuneration Policy the maximum level of variable remuneration Illustration of Remuneration Policy which may be awarded is 400% of salary of which 250% is permitted under the PSP under the exceptional circumstances limit and The charts below illustrate the application of the Remuneration Policy set out in the Policy Table for Executive Directors.
