Directors remuneration report Remuneration Committee Annual Statement Summary of 2016 On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the report of the Remuneration Committee for the year to 31 July 2016.
As last year, this report is split into three parts: Strong cash conversion performance this Annual Statement: Appointment of a new Chief Executive and a policy report, which presents the Groups forward-looking Finance Director Directors remuneration policy: and Approved simplification of long-term incentives an Annual Report on Remuneration, which details how our remuneration policy was implemented during the year to for 2016 31July 2016 and how we intend to apply our policy in the year to31July2017.
Following the approval of the revised Policy at last years AGM, there are no proposed changes to the Policy this year.
As highlighted by the Chairman and Chief Executive in their annual statements on pages 8 to 13 of this Annual Report, the markets remained challenging in the year to 31 July 2016.
However, four of the five divisions reported growth in reported revenue and headline operating profit.
Even though the operating profit declined in John Crane driven by the tough global energy market conditions, the division reported resilient margin performance.
At a Group level, cash conversion remained very strong at 102% and ROCE, at 15%, remains well ahead of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Against this backdrop, annual bonus payouts are between target and maximum but the TSR and EPS elements of 2013 LTIP awards lapsed in full following the end of the performance period on 31July 2016.
The Groups cash conversion, however, warranted the full payout of that element of the annual bonus and a partial vesting of the LTIP.
The matching award under the CIP vested based on our sustained ROCE performance.
The Committee recognises the importance of close alignment of remuneration with Group performance and we consider the incentive outcomes for this year to demonstrate this link further details of which are disclosed in this years Annual Report on Remuneration.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders for their continued support.

The only amendments to this policy report from the version approved by shareholders in 2015 are to update the data used in the pay-for-performance scenarios, to add page references, and to remove any references on the implementation of this policy in 2016.

Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 97 Directors remuneration report Continued Existing grants or entitlements It is the Companys intention to honour all pre-existing commitments at the date of this report and to honour all future obligations entered into, consistent with the approved remuneration Policy in force at that time.
In the case of internal promotion to the Board, the Committee intends to honour any pre-existing commitments made prior to becoming a member of the Board, including where these differ from the approved remuneration Policy.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting Annual bonus measures are selected to reflect the Companys short-term financial and non-financial priorities.
At its discretion, the Committee may vary these measures at the start of each financial year to maintain close alignment between executive incentives and the annual business plan.
The measures used in the Long-Term Incentive Plan are selected to reflect Smiths prevailing strategy and to reinforce the key drivers of value creation highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report: operating margin, cash conversion and ROCE.
Annual bonus and LTIP targets are reviewed annually, and take into account the Companys strategic plan, analyst forecasts for Smiths and its sector comparators and external expectations for Smiths key markets.
The Remuneration Committee sets targets that it considers to be challenging but attainable and aligned to the Companys business objectives over the short term, as reflected in the annual business plan, and longer term, consistent with the strategic plan.
On top of aligning strategy with incentives, targets are designed to ensure that participants are aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Difference in policy between executive director and other employees The reward policy for other senior employees is broadly consistent with that for executive directors, and the Company does not currently operate any incentive plans in which only executive directors participate.
The Remuneration Committee reviews each year the all-employee pay and incentive trends and takes these into account in setting executive director pay levels.
The principles of remuneration packages being market related, performance sensitive and driven by business needs are applied at all levels and geographies in the Group.

For the purposes of making such awards, but for no other reason, the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.
The Remuneration Committee may also make payments to cover reasonable expenses in recruitment and relocation, and any other miscellaneous expenses including but not limited to housing, tax and immigration support.
100 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Governance Accounts Internal promotions In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external appointees, as detailed above.
Any commitments made prior to an individuals promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the commitment is fulfilled, although the Company may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individuals existing service contract on promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and prevailing market best practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director external or internal, including details of any exceptional payments, will be disclosed in the RNS notification made at the time of appointment and in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which the recruitment occurred.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 100.
Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
In addition to payment of basic salary, pension allowance and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the one-year notice period, the predetermined sum would include annual bonus and share awards only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the end of the relevant performance period and subject to the normal performance conditions.

Except where appointed at a general meeting, directors stand for election by shareholders at the first AGM following appointment.

A good leaver will typically remain eligible for a pro-rated annual bonus award to be paid after the end of the financial year and LTIP awards will typically vest at the normal vesting date to the extent that the associated performance conditions are met, but will normally be pro-rated on the basis of actual service within the performance period.
In cases of death or disability, individuals are automatically deemed to be good leavers under the plan rules of the LTIP.
All other good leavers will be defined at the discretion of the Committee on a case-by-case basis.
In the event of a change of control, LTIP awards will vest to the extent that each of the performance conditions is met based on the Committees assessment of performance over the performance period to the date of change of control.
For internal performance measures, the Committee may exercise its judgment in determining the outcome based on its assessment of whether or not the performance conditions would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end of the full performance period.
Awards will also normally bepro-rated to reflect the time that has elapsed between the grant of the award and the date of change of control.
The Committee retains discretion to vary these provisions on a case-by-case basis.
In connection with the termination of an executive directors contract, the Company may make a payment on account of accrued but untaken leave and may pay outplacement and legal fees for support provided to the individual.
External appointments Subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, the Committee allows executive directors to accept external appointments where it considers that such appointments will contribute to the directors breadth of knowledge and experience.
Directors are permitted to retain fees associated with such appointments.
Consideration of employment conditions The Committee always takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company.
We do not consult directly with employees regarding executive director pay.
Each year the Committee is provided with information on pay trends and ratios of the wider employee population across the Group.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee has actively consulted with major shareholders whenever there have been changes to the remuneration policy in a manner that is receptive to and respectful of shareholder views.
