Annual Report and Accounts 2016 National Express Group PLC 91 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Base salary Effective from 1 January 2016, the Committee determined that the salary for the Group Chief Executive would be increased to 589,000.
The Committee agreed that this increase was warranted in order to maintain the market competitiveness of his salary when compared against direct peers and companies of similar size.

Mathew Ashley was appointed to the role of Group Finance Director on 28 January 2015.
His base salary upon appointment was setat 300,000.
As Matthew had made a significant contribution to the business in his first year and performed strongly against theobjectives set for him and during a period of strong corporate performance, the Committee determined that it would be appropriate to increase his salary to 325,000 which became effective from 1 January 2016.
This increase positions Matthews basepay between the lower quartile and median against a comparator group of similarly sized businesses and still allows for futuresalary progression as he completes his development.
Performance-related bonus A summary of the 2016 performance-related bonus scheme is summarised below.
The maximum potential bonus payable for 2016 to the Group Chief Executive was 200% of salary and, in respect of the Group Finance Director, 150% of salary.
For the Group Chief Executive, 25% of the bonus earned up to 125% of salary, 50% of the bonus earned from 125% to 150% and75% of the bonus earned from 150% to 200% of salary was to be deferred For the Group Finance Director, 25% of the bonus earned up to 125% of salary and 50% of the bonus earned from 125% to 150%of salary was to be deferred The amounts deferred under the bonus plan in 2016 are deferred into shares awarded under the Executive Deferred Bonus Plan EDBP for one year.
Receipt of the deferred shares is subject to continued service and good leaver provisions under the EDBP.
The2016 bonus also includes provisions that require the deferred shares to be forfeited or repaid should it be necessary for the Company to restate materially its 2016 results within a two-year period following the deferred bonus being awarded.
The proportion of the bonus that would be subject to these provisions would depend on the extent to which the original bonus payment turned out to be false following the publication of corrected results.
The Committee has reviewed the performance against the conditions attached to the performance-related bonus and, in addition, made an assessment of the performance of the Group as a whole during 2016.
The Committee has full discretion in the payment of annual bonuses.
For any financial element to be payable, the Group must have achieved a threshold level of normalised profit target for the year.
In addition, it is a pre-condition to the award of any bonus that the Committee has determined that there has been an improvement in safety processes, procedures and outcomes during the year before any bonus is paid.
In respect of the targets applying to the annual bonus for 2016 for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, a maximum of 150% and 112.5% respectively of salary was payable based on achievement against a sliding scale of challenging financial targets.
A maximum of 50% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 37.5% for the Group Finance Director was payablebased on non-financial targets that encompassed customer, operational excellence and people objectives.
The targets set in relation to non-financial performance are key strategic Group objectives that are tailored to the responsibilities of each individual Executive Director and, in aggregate, are considered to be similarly challenging to the range of financial targets set.

This excellent result, underpinned by a strong and sustainable free cash flow, merited an increase in the full year dividend of 8.4%.
The Group carried a record 921 million passengers 2015: 867 million, with the first full year of German rail operations carrying 20 million passengers.
There was strong growth in North America with revenue and operating profit up 14.3% and 11.9% on a constant currency basis.

Annual Report and Accounts 2016 National Express Group PLC 101 Corporate Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued The context of pay in the National Express Group The following table sets out the change in certain elements of the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive from 2015 to 2016 compared with the average percentage change for the UK employee population.
The Group Chief Executives remuneration, disclosed in the table below, has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus including any amount deferred on the basis used for determining the single figure.
The UK employee remuneration is based on the base salary, taxable benefits and annual bonus of those UK employees who received taxable benefits and bonuses.
The Group uses the UK workforce as an appropriate comparator group for the average employee as this avoids complicated exchange rate adjustments that would have to be used if we included employees in the Groups overseas operations inthe calculation.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2017 Executive Directors base salaries The Committee determined that the salary for the Group Chief Executive would be increased by 4.4% to 615,000 with effect from 1January 2017.
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee recognised the Group Chief Executives strong personal performance in his role which had delivered: significant shareholder value over the course of 2016: a good outlook for the Group for 2017 under the strategy for growth: and strong delivery on operational metrics.
In addition, the Committee took into account that, when compared with direct competitors, the Group Chief Executives overall remuneration package is more highly geared with outcome driven through stronger annual and long-term incentives which drive 102 National Express Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 greater shareholder value.
Also, the Committee is mindful that, whilst the Groups general awarded pay increase in 2016 across theGroup was 2%, when allowing for other factors such as progression increases within a grade structure, promotional increases and market adjustments, UK employees had seen a 4% increase in base pay over the previous 12 months.
The Committee determined that the salary for Matthew Ashley would be increased by 7.7% to 350,000 with effect from 1 January 2017.
After another excellent year of personal delivery during 2016 and in recognition of his strong performance in the role, the Committee determined that it was appropriate that the second step of Matthews salary towards the market rate for this role, as disclosed in the 2015 Remuneration Report, be implemented.
In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, Matthew Ashley will beprovided with relocation expenses to cover his secondment as President and CEO of the North America division.
The details ofMatthew Ashleys international assignment package will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
Chris Davies has been appointed to the role of Group Finance Director and will take up his appointment after the conclusion of the Companys AGM on 10 May 2017.
His base salary was set at 350,000 for 2017.
Pension entitlements and cash allowances The Group Chief Executive will receive a 35% salary supplement and the other Executive Directors will receive a 25% salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions.
Benefits under the Group Chief Executives unfunded pension arrangement ceased toaccrue from 5 June 2016.
Performance-related bonus The annual bonus for the 2017 financial year will operate on the same basis as the arrangements in place during 2016.
The structure of the annual bonus for 2017 will be: a maximum bonus of 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and of 150% of salary for the other Executive Directors: the proportion of the bonus linked to non-financial measures will be 25% based on operational excellence, safety standards andother strategic objectives: the remaining 75% of the bonus will be based on achievement of financial targets, namely profit before tax and free cash flow: and a proportion of bonus earned will be deferred in shares for one year.
For 2017, 25% of the bonus earned up to 125% of salary, 50% of the bonus earned from 125% to 150% of salary and, for the Group CEO, 75% of bonus earned above 150% of salary willbe deferred.
When setting the bonus target for 2017, the Committee has taken into account: stock market consensus for 2017 profit: the Directors continuing commitment to record bid costs as normalised operating expenses: the increased pricing pressure from RENFE in Spain: the national reduction in regional bus journeys made in the UK and the increased competition from Uber: and the national reduction in regional train journeys made in the UK and the consequential increased price competition to UK Coach.
Targets will be set on a basis consistent with accounting measures, ie without reference to exceptionals.
The Committee will set calibrated targets for the bonus measures and intends to disclose actual performance against these targets in next years Directors Remuneration Report.
As a matter of commercial sensitivity, the Committee has decided not to disclose performance targets in advance.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentive awards granted in the 2017 financial year will be granted in accordance with the policy detailed in the Remuneration Policy section of this report.
Awards will be made worth 200% of salary for the Group Chief Executive and 150% ofsalary for the other Executive Directors.
The performance measures, their weightings and targets for the 2017 awards will be as follows: Threshold EPS, TSR: 30% vesting Target Maximum Metric Weighting ROCE: 0% vesting 50% vesting 100% vesting 2019 financial year EPS 1 3 29.8 pence 31.6 pence 34.4 pence Average ROCE financial years 2017-2019 1 3 9% 10% 12% Relative TSR vs FTSE 250 1 6 Median Upper quintile Relative TSR vs Bespoke Index 1 6 Equal to Index Index 10% pa Notional index comprising Go-Ahead Group, First Group and Stagecoach Group.
For TSR measures, straight-line vesting will occur between threshold and maximum levels of performance.
For EPS and ROCE measures, straight-line vesting will occur between threshold and target, and target and maximum levels of performance.
Performance will be measured over a three-year period and awards will be subject to a two-year holding period post vesting.
