Free cash flow significantly out-performed the target range as a result of better than anticipated trading, better than expected working capital from the Spirit business and lower than anticipated interest and pension costs.
The personal target for Rooney Anand related to the strengthening and development of the senior executive team.
Following the remuneration committees assessment ofthepersonal target and actual performance, 7.5% of salary was awarded.
The personal targets for Kirk Davis related to targets linked to like for like sales growth and the performance of the senior finance team.
As the like for like sales growth targets remain commercially sensitive, the target and result have not been disclosed above but will be disclosed next year.
Following the remuneration committees assessment of the personal targets and actual performance, 5% of salary was awarded against these metrics.
Performance against the combined financial and individual targets resulted in bonuses being paid at 594k 97.5% of eligible salary for the chief executive and at 264k 77.5% of eligible salary for the chief financial officer.
Eligible salary is salary earned during the relevant financial year.
Disclosure of 2014 15 bonus targets On the basis that the financial targets and the companys performance against those targets for the 2014 15 financial year are no longer considered commercially sensitive, details are set out below.
The group delivered a strong financial result for the year, achieving record sales and profit, with revenue up 3.0%, notwithstanding underlying retail growth being lower than anticipated and operating profit before exceptional items up 3.8%.
Profit before tax and exceptional items fell 0.8% to 168.5m although adjusted earnings per share were up 1.3%.
Operating cash flows continued to be strong.

Annual report 2016 GREENE KING PLC 61 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration report continued Audited information continued Long-term incentive plans The LTIP awards granted on 4 August 2013 were based on a three year performance period ended 1 May 2016.
The target ranges, calculated onastraight-line basis from 0% to 100%, are set out below.
Threshold Maximum Actual Actual vesting percentage percentage Performance measure Performance target performance of award of award of award 1 Core LTIP earnings per share 62.3p 68.5p 69.9p 0% 100% 100% 2 Growth LTIP return on capital employed 8.85% 9.55% 9.38% 0% 100% 76% Notes: 1.
The earnings per share target was adjusted to take account of an increased number of disposals and the acquisition of Spirit which completed in June 2015.
No adjustment was made in respect of anticipated synergies arising from the acquisition allowing management to benefit from those that have been delivered.
The prior target range was 59.7p 65.9p.
The committee is satisfied that the adjustment was appropriate and that the revised target was a fairer measure of performance and was no more or less difficult to achieve than the previous range.
The ROCE target was adjusted on the same basis as the earnings per share target.
The award details for the executive directors are therefore as follows: Estimated value of dividend equivalent Total Number Number Number Estimated shares estimated 1 2 of shares of shares of shares value to vest value Director Type of award at grant to vest to lapse '000 '000 '000 Rooney Anand Core LTIP 68,630 68,630 594 65 659 Rooney Anand Growth LTIP 68,630 52,159 16,471 452 61 513 Notes: 1.
The estimated value of the shares is based on the average share price during the three months to 1 May 2016 866 p. 2.
The LTIP enables award holders to benefit from the payment of dividend equivalents but only to the extent that the underlying share awards vest.
The estimated value has been calculated on the same basis as set out in note 1 above, with an additional estimate for the value of the dividend equivalent shares which will be due in relation to the 2016 final dividend payable in September 2016.

The EPS target applicable to the core LTIP wasincreased by the forecast net benefit to earnings that Spirit was forecast to generate and the ROCE target applicable to the growth LTIP was adjusted to reflect the expected impact of Spirit on returns.
No adjustment was made in respect of delivering the potential future synergies to enable management to benefit should these be delivered as planned.
Under the revised targets there will be no vesting of the core award for EPS growth of 26.2% or less above a base of 56.1p, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for growth of 35.3% during the performance period above that base.
The prior target range was 2231% above the 56.1p base.
For the growth LTIP award, there will be no vesting for ROCE of 9.25% or less, increasing on a straight-line basisto full vesting for ROCE of 9.85% at the end of the performance period.
The prior target range was 9.410.0%.
