Therefore, we are join the Board of such a well-respected and high performing company proposing to increase the maximum under the 2017 Policy to 150%.

In 2017 we are not proposing any change to the bonus This Remuneration Report has been split into two sections: opportunity for the Group Chief Executive 125% or the other Executive Directors 100%.

Group Chief Executive and Executive Directors currently receive an annual grant under the PSP of 100% of salary.
Our market review A new Directors Remuneration Policy demonstrates that we are positioned below the lower quartile for this To set the background, there has been considerable improvement in compensation element.
An intrinsic part of our value to shareholders the overall performance of the Group during the period covered by has been our ability to deliver long-term growth and we believe that our the existing Remuneration Policy approved at the 2014 AGM and remuneration structures should reflect this by having an appropriate our share price has increased from 29.76 on 2nd January 2014 to balance between long-term performance through the PSP and 44.49 on 28th February 2017.

Historically, this has meant that review, we commissioned our independent Remuneration Committee only a certain percentage of the awards made actually vest in advisers, Willis Towers Watson, to undertake a detailed study of our accordance with the performance criteria.
For example, in 2015 and peers and wider market practices to inform our thinking.
This is the 2016, 33.06% and 80.33% of the awards granted in 2012 and 2013 first external review since 2014 and the first to consider long-term respectively vested.
Based on this, the Committee developed a Policy that fairly rewards performance and provides tailored incentives The 2014 Policy allows for a maximum grant of 100% of base salary in that will drive business performance rather than simply aligning with normal circumstances and 150% in exceptional circumstances.
proposing a revised maximum of 200% of salary in the 2017 Policy.
In reviewing the proposed changes to our Remuneration Policy, and its Given the time elapsed since the last change in Executive award levels, operation in 2017, we had the following key principles in mind: the corresponding changes in the Company since then, feedback from shareholders regarding our pay mix and external market data, we ensure we have the ability to remain competitive in the market for are proposing to increase the grant to the Group Chief Executive from executive talent: 100% to 150% of salary and from 100% to 125% of salary for the other provide future flexibility with respect to our variable Executive Directors, for 2017. compensation limits: We are also proposing the adoption of a post-vesting holding period of have an appropriate balance between short-term and two years beyond the current three year PSP performance period for long-term incentives: Executive Directors.

In conjunction with the proposed changes in PSP award introduce a post-vesting holding period to align with shareholders levels, there will be a corresponding increase in the share ownership interests.
The Group Chief Executive will now be expected to accumulate at least 200% of salary in Spirax Sarco shares and the The 2017 Remuneration Policy 2017 Policy is substantially the same other Executive Directors will be expected to accumulate shares worth as the 2014 Remuneration Policy 2014 Policy and I believe that the 125% of salary.

Prior to award, the Committee reviews the performance targets for each measure to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching.
For financial measures this includes a review of analysts forecasts.
PSP awards are subject to malus reduction in the amount of deferred and as yet unpaid compensation and clawback reimbursement of compensation that has already been paid for up to three years following the award, and can be applied during a holding period.
Circumstances that may result in a clawback or malus adjustment include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
In relation to PSP awards made prior to 2017, the maximum award under the PSP is 100% of base salary but, in exceptional circumstances, this may be increased to 150% of base salary.
Vesting is based on two performance conditions measured over a three-year period, which have been chosen as they are aligned with our strategy: TSR performance relative to a comparator group: and aggregate EPS.

REMUNERATION ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION 2016 CONTINUED With effect from 2016, the EPS element of the PSP is based on growth in excess of global industrial production growth rates, often referred to in our industry as Global IP, rather than UK RPI.
Global IP is a measure that the Board and management have used for some time as there is well documented evidence that it is the best predictor of the global and industrial markets within which the Group operates.
For these reasons, IP was used in the formulation of the long-term strategic plan and targets for EPS growth approved by the Board.
As a result, the Committee was of the view it made sense to incorporate Global IP into our PSP, as a means of better aligning the assessment of performance against our long-term strategic plan and market dynamics within our industry.
The Committee reviewed the historical and projected data 2007-2020, including the Groups performance, market benchmarks and analysts consensus to determine a performance range associated with this benchmark growth rate that remains sufficiently challenging across various market environments.
Accordingly, threshold vesting will occur for exceeding Global IP by 2% per annum, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for exceeding Global IP by 8% per annum.
The Global IP data source is the CHR Metals Global IP Index, providing data, that incorporates over 90% of global industrial output.

Additional details and an explanation of the changes can be found in the Statement by the Chairman of the Committee on pages 85 and 86.
Outstanding incentive awards Details of outstanding incentive awards granted to Executive Directors prior to the Policy coming into force, including awards granted in 2016, and details of the performance targets are set out on pages 89 to 92 of the Annual Report on Remuneration 2016.
All incentive awards granted prior to this Policy coming into force will continue on their existing terms including the exercise of discretion to amend such awards.
Remuneration policy for other employees The Companys approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and market pay levels.
The most senior managers in the business approximately 80 people globally participate in bonus arrangements with similar targets, measures and relative weightings to the Executive Directors.
Target and maximum potential values are lower and determined by the grade of the managers role.
Performance targets are based on an appropriate combination of Group, divisional and local operating company financial measures.
Contractual terms and benefits for the wider workforce are subject to local employment legislation and best practice.
Measure selection and the target setting process Measures are selected taking into account the key strategic priorities of the Company, shareholder expectations and factors that sit within an individuals span of control.

REMUNERATION REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT 2017 CONTINUED Targets are set with reference to internal and external forecasts to ensure that they are realistic, yet sufficiently stretching.
An appropriate mix of long and short-term targets will be used, informed by the nature of the measure.
2.3 External directorships Directors are permitted to hold external directorships in order to broaden their experience, to the benefit of the Company.
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the Director may retain any fees paid in respect of such directorships.
The Board ensures compliance by Directors with Code provision B.
2.4 Approach to recruitment and promotion remuneration When appointing external hires, promoting executives, or an Executive Director internally, the Committee will continue to act in the best interests of shareholders when determining remuneration, in line with the stated policy.
The main elements of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Director appointments are: Base salary will be set on appointment taking into account the factors set out in the Policy table, but also the individuals experience.
Depending on an individuals prior experience, the Committee may set salary below market norms, with the intention that it is realigned over time, typically two to three years, subject to performance in the role.
In this situation, the Committee is permitted to exceed the normal rate of annual salary increase set out in the Policy table.
On-going annual incentive pay opportunity will not exceed 350% of salary, in line with the maximums stated in the Policy table up to 150% of salary for annual bonus and an award of up to 200% of salary under the PSP.
In the year of appointment an off-cycle award under the PSP may be made by the Committee to ensure an immediate alignment of individual interests.
In addition to the standard elements of remuneration, on the appointment of an external candidate, the Committee reserves the right to buy-out incentive awards that the individual has foregone by accepting the appointment, if appropriate.
The terms of such awards would be informed by the amounts being forfeited and the associated terms for example the extent to which the outstanding awards were subject to performance, the vehicles and the associated time horizons.
Awards would be made either through the existing share plans or in accordance with the relevant provisions contained within the Listing Rules.
When an internal appointment to the Board is made, any pre-existing obligations may be honoured by the Committee and payment will be permitted under this Remuneration Policy.
For internal promotions, salary will be capped at that of the incumbent Group Chief Executive.
Details of the remuneration for any new Chairman or Executive Director appointed to the Board will be disclosed on the Groups website, www.
2.5 Service agreements and termination policy The Companys policy on service agreements and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below.
Service agreements are designed to reflect the interests of the Company, as well as the individual concerned.
Executive Directors service agreements are kept at the Companys headquarters in Cheltenham.
In accordance with the Code and guidelines issued by institutional investors, Executive Directors have service agreements that are terminable by either the Company or the Executive Director on 12 months notice.
In the event of termination or resignation, and subject to business reasons, the Company would not necessarily hold the Executive Director to his or her full notice period.
All Directors are subject to election if newly appointed in the year or re-election at the AGM.
Service agreements set out restrictions on the ability of the Executive Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees or to solicit deal with clients of the Group or interfere with supply, in the 12 months following the cessation of employment.
Salary, pension and benefits are included in the agreements and are treated as described in the policy table on pages 100 to 103.
There is no contractual entitlement to payment of an annual bonus or granting of an award under the PSP, until individual participation, level of award, measures and targets have been set for a particular year.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but serve the Company under letters of appointment, for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election at the AGM.
104 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Governance Report Financial Statements Corporate Information Group Chief Executive and new appointments from 1st January 2013 The details of the service agreements of the Group Chief Executive and for new appointments to the Board are outlined below and comply with best practice.
In the event of a material change in role, function or responsibilities, Executive Directors agreements will be reviewed and will be expected to be updated to meet the requirements outlined below.
Notice period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances.
No additional termination payment if notice worked.
If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice, otherwise 12 months base salary only.
Company discretion to pay in lieu of notice in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control, when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits, excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the annual bonus or PSP.
Robust post-termination restrictions on confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-interference with customers or suppliers.
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
Clawback or malus Bonus payments and PSP awards are subject to clawback or malus for up to three years following award.
Circumstances include financial misstatement, erroneous calculations determining bonus payments or gross misconduct.
Executive Directors legacy agreements Within the legacy agreements of Executive Directors, termination of agreements is subject to a 12 month notice period.
Where payment is made in lieu of notice on termination, the payment of a sum in respect of lost future bonus opportunity based on an average of the preceding three years bonus payments is subject to the Committees discretion.
The Committee has the power to reduce the amount to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory.
On termination of such an Executive Directors service agreement, the Committee will take into account the departing Executive Directors need to mitigate his or her loss when determining the amount of bonus.
Payment will only be made at the discretion of the Committee after taking into account individual performance in order to ensure that there will be no payments for failure.
In any event, payments will be subject to clawback or malus provisions.
Executive Directors service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as termination for gross misconduct or financial misstatement.
While the Executive Directors service agreements include a provision to deal with termination on a change of control, in the event of an offer being made, shareholders have discretion to accept the offer or not.
The decision to recommend acceptance, or not, is a matter for the Board, and the Committee is of the clear view that the change of control provision within the Executive Directors service agreements would have no influence on the voting pattern of those Executive Directors.
Executive Directors legacy agreements are summarised in the table below.
Notice Period 12 months by the Executive Director and 12 months by the Company Termination No payment if Executive Director commits a repudiatory breach of the service agreement or for gross misconduct or in certain circumstances.
If notice only part worked part on garden leave, payment in respect of unexpired period of notice.
Otherwise 12 months base salary, the value of other benefits, plus the cost of pension credits or contributions for the period plus the average of the prior three years annual bonus payments, with Committee discretion to reduce the amount of the bonus that would otherwise be calculated, to reflect performance on the part of the Executive Director that is considered by the Committee to be below the required standards, provided that termination by the Company does not occur within 12 months of a change of control.
Committee discretion to pay in lump sum or monthly except within 12 months of a change of control when a lump sum will be paid.
If paid monthly, payment will be reduced by the value of any salary, fees and benefits excluding long-term incentives, earned in new paid employment in that period.
No automatic entitlement to payments under the current annual bonus or PSP.

REMUNERATION REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT 2017 CONTINUED Treatment of leavers under the incentive plans Whilst it is not an entitlement, it is expected that where an Executive Director is a good leaver ie where the cessation of employment is due to death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company business in which he she works being disposed of or where the ending of employment is instigated by the Company and is not for cause, payments will be made under the annual bonus plan if performance targets are met subject to, and in accordance with, the plan rules.
If the Executive Director is not a good leaver it is expected that no bonus will be paid.
The treatment of leavers under the PSP is determined in accordance with the shareholder approved PSP rules.
Any awards granted within six months prior to termination or the giving or receiving of notice will lapse.
Any awards granted six months or longer prior to termination of employment but prior to the end of the performance period will lapse unless the Executive Director is considered to be a good leaver.
In the case of a good leaver the award will vest on the termination date, or the normal vesting date, at the Committees discretion.
This is subject to the satisfaction of the performance targets at that date and a pro-rata reduction in the number of shares to take account of the shortening of the performance period.
For awards granted on or after 1st March 2012, if the Executive Director is a good leaver where the ending of employment is not for cause, the number of shares vested may be reduced including to zero by the Committee in its absolute discretion.
If an Executive Director ceases employment or notice is given on or after the end of the performance period but prior to the date on which the Committee has determined the extent to which the award has vested, if the Executive Director is a good leaver, his her award will be preserved and will be treated in the same way as if his her employment had continued, whereas if the Executive Director is not a good leaver, his her award will lapse on the earlier of his her cessation of employment and the giving of notice.
In relation to the ESOP, as an HMRC approved plan, where an Executive Director leaves the treatment will be in line with the approved plan rules and HMRC guidance.
Change of control Bonus: if termination occurs within 12 months of a change of control, the Executive Director is entitled to i a lump sum payment in lieu of notice and ii receive a full bonus payment calculated by reference to the average of the preceding three years bonus payments without any reduction for performance.
PSP: the rules provide that in the event of a change of control, outstanding share-based awards will vest to the extent that performance targets are met at the date of the event.
Any such vesting would generally be on a time pro-rated basis.
The Committee may, at its discretion, increase the level of vesting if it believes that exceptional circumstances warrant such treatment.
2.6 Illustrations of application of the Remuneration Policy Under the Remuneration Policy, a significant portion of remuneration is variable and depends on the Companys performance.
Below and overleaf we illustrate how the total pay opportunity for the Executive Directors varies under three performance scenarios: maximum, on target, and below threshold.
The scenarios for 2017, informed by the current application of our pay policy, are as follows: Element Fixed pay, benefits and ESOP Fixed pay and ESOP does not vary with performance and comprises: base salary effective 1st January 2017: benefits value based on 2016 disclosure: pension value DB 2016: as reported: cash allowance: rate applied to 2017 salary : and ESOP participation of up to 1,500 1:1 matching shares for eligible Executive Directors.
Percentage of base salary Below threshold On target Maximum Annual bonus % of salary 0% 75% CEO 60% ED 125% CEO 100% ED 1 PSP % of salary at award 0% 37.5% CEO 31.25% ED 150% CEO 125% ED 1 A level of 25% vesting for on target performance is equivalent to threshold performance under the PSP, which the Committee believes to be a fair assumption for on target performance given the approach taken to setting performance targets.

When conducting the annual salary review, the average base salary increase awarded to the UK workforce and senior managers across the Group provides a key reference point when determining levels of increase for Executive Director remuneration.
The Remuneration Policy was drawn up by the Committee without the need for any consultation with employees.
The Committee also determines the principles and policy of remuneration which shall apply to the Groups senior managers.
The responsibility for determining precise compensation packages that meet local practice and performance targets lies with the Group Chief Executive and the responsible Executive Director.
To ensure consistency in Remuneration Policy across the Group and to encourage a performance culture, senior managers participate in the PSP.
The Board believes that share ownership is an effective way of aligning the interests of managers and shareholders and to strengthen the development of the business.
2.8 Statement of consideration of shareholder views In developing and reviewing the Companys Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and other senior executives, the Committee seeks and takes into account the range of views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers.
The Committee Chairman actively engages with major shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers when appropriate and takes into account their views when reviewing and implementing the Companys Remuneration Policy.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from institutional shareholder advisers more generally.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during the year at meetings with shareholders, is considered as part of the Companys annual Remuneration Policy review.
At the AGM in 2016, the advisory vote on the 2015 Annual Report on Remuneration received 97.2% in favour.
At the AGM in 2014 the Remuneration Policy received 98.5% in favour.
In finalising the 2017 Remuneration Policy the views of shareholders and institutional shareholder advisers have shaped the: introduction of an additional two-year post-vesting holding period for PSP grants: rebalance of long-term and short-term compensation opportunities by way of the Directors PSP opportunity now being more substantive than the AIP: agreement to disclose AIP targets retrospectively: increase in share ownership requirements: removal of the Committees discretion to grant one-off awards for recruitment or retention in exceptional circumstances: keeping of the PSP performance metrics under review, including the consideration of organic growth measures: and reserving of the Committees right to adjust for the effects of divestments or major acquisitions from the EPS results, to ensure those results are in line with the primarily organic growth principles that support the EPS targets.
