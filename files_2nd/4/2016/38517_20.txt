Strategic measures will focus Executives on key drivers of long-term performance.
For example, these will be key milestones or projects that ensure the business is appropriately developed for the future, and are likely to be shared across both Executives.
Personal measures will be tailored to each role, and cover areas such as people development, specific job related goals, and the extent to which the Executives set and drive the culture of PageGroup and have the appropriate succession plans in place for the future.
Longer-term metrics will include Gross Profit growth relative to peers, and EPS growth.
Targets for the trailing EPS performance metric for 2017 will take account of the internal long-term business plan and strategic goals, and broker forecasts.
The Committees intention for future awards is to set targets, in normal circumstances, that align to a sustained, long-term rate of EPS growth.
The threshold performance level is expected to imply an annual growth rate above price inflation, and a materially more significant margin above price inflation at maximum vesting.
For the first award, performance will be measured over one year to avoid measuring performance over periods already known.
For the second award, performance will be measured over two years, and for the third and later awards performance will be measured over three years.
Transparent disclosure of performance measures, targets, and the assessment of performance will be provided retrospectively, starting in the 2018 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long-Term Incentive From 2018 there will be no further awards under the LTIP.
The last LTIP award will be granted in March 2017 under the existing policy before the new policy comes into force.
The face value of awards will be 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 175% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
The performance measures and weightings for these awards will be unchanged from 2016: Cumulative 3-year EPS 62.5% of award Comparator Gross Profit Growth 12.5% of award Strategic measures 25% of award For the portion of the award subject to the EPS performance condition, cumulative EPS will be measured over the three years 2017-19 with threshold performance of 69p 25% vesting and maximum performance of 84p 100% vesting.
This performance range takes account of broker forecasts and the Companys business plan.
The relative gross profit metric will be measured against a comparator group of companies and structured on the same basis as for awards granted in 2016.
The Committee currently considers the targets for strategic measures to be commercially sensitive and will disclose the targets once the final vesting outcome has been determined.
Pensions In line with the Remuneration Policy the Executive Directors receive a contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme or a cash equivalent.
The Chief Executive Officer receives a contribution equivalent to 25% of his base salary.
The Chief Financial Officer receives a contribution equivalent to 20% of his base salary.
