Following his promotion to CEO, the Committee reviewed Richard Smiths salary against a range of internal and external factors and elected to set it at a level of 430,000 per annum effective 1 June 2016.
For the other remaining Executive Directors, Joe Lister and Richard Simpson, the Committee reflected on the intention to operate with a smaller management team going forward, and the additional key responsibilities taken on by each individual.
Specifically, Joe Lister will now lead investor relations and has line management responsibility for the Corporate Affairs and People directorates, while Richard Simpson has been tasked with heading up Unites Health and Safety, Maintenance and Lifecycle and Asset Management functions.
86 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED Considering these significant role changes, and mindful of the need to retain successful, experienced and well-regarded Executive Directors in a competitive sector, the Committee reviewed a number of alternative approaches for the remuneration of Joe Lister and Richard Simpson to ensure they remain focused on delivering Unites strategy during a period of potential instability.
Following careful consideration of the alternatives permitted within the recently approved remuneration policy, the Committee determined to increase the base salaries of Joe and Richard by c. 20% to 350,000 and 325,000 per annum respectively with effect from 1 June 2016.
In taking this decision, the Committee noted the alternative of making exceptional LTIP awards but concluded that: r Salary levels were the element of remuneration most significantly below market particularly taking into account the additional responsibilities, whereas long-term incentive opportunities, at 200% of salary, are market competitive r An increase in long-term incentive opportunities had already been implemented for 2016 from 150% to 200% of salary: and r Maintaining the current ratio between fixed variable pay and short-term long-term pay is important so as not to incentivise excessive risk-taking.
Details of the evolution of each Directors role and salary over the course of the year is summarised in the table below: Base salary from Base salary to 1 March 2016 Base salary 28 February to 31 May Percentage from 1 June Percentage Executive Director Role 2016 2016 change 2016 change MD, Operations 247,700 270,000 9% 59% R S Smith 3% below Chief Executive 430,000 predecessor Chief Financial Officer 274,600 291,000 6% J J Lister Chief Financial Officer 350,000 20% MD, Property 247,700 270,000 9% R C Simpson Group Property Director 325,000 20% M C Allan Chief Executive 434,000 442,680 2% Total Board 1,204,000 1,273,680 5.8% 1,105,000 -13.2% Performance related annual bonus in respect of 2016 performance The 2016 annual bonus consists of two elements, corporate and individual.
The corporate element of the bonus is calculated on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 120% of base salary, in accordance with which on-target performance by the Group results in a corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 70% of base salary.
To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier being the individual element of the scheme, ranging between zero and 1.2 is applied against the corporate bonus.
Applying the maximum individual multiplier of 1.2, against the maximum corporate bonus of 120% of base salary, results in a maximum annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary.
However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Director.
Target performance typically requires meaningful improvement on the previous years outturn, and for financial measures, targets are typically in line with the upper end of market consensus.
The performance related bonuses awarded in respect of 2016 reflect corporate bonuses of 62.5% of base salary.
After applying individual multipliers, actual performance related bonus payments awarded to the Executive Directors were 62.5% of their respective base salaries 43.4% of their maximum bonus opportunities.

The Companys strong financial performance, particularly under the adjusted EPS and net debt to EBITDA ratio elements, is testament to both management and the broader employee population, and while executives fell short of the stretching customer satisfaction targets, the 2016 result still places Unite in the upper quintile of our benchmark.
Each of the Executive Directors has been a significant contributor to the achievement of key business objectives, while continuing to demonstrate both strong personal progression and exceptional teamwork despite a year of significant change.
The proposed On-target individual multipliers of 1.0x reflect our satisfaction with the progress that each individual has made in their new roles and we will look for this to be progressed further as we move into 2017.
Having already reached their respective share ownership guidelines, each Executive Director will receive 100% of their bonus awards in cash.

The actual value at vesting will be trued-up in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Executives also became entitled to cash in lieu of the dividends payable on vested LTIP shares over the three-year performance period.
These payments are included in the row entitled LTIP in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 85, and amounted to 29,987, 33,258, and 29,987 for Messrs. Smith, Lister and Simpson respectively.
Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all employees.
The CEOs remuneration includes base salary, taxable benefit and annual bonus and for 2016 is calculated as an aggregate of the remuneration of Mark Allan until 31 May 2016 and of Richard Smith thereafter annual bonus relates to Richard Smith full year.
The pay for all other employees is calculated using the increase in the earnings of full-time employees for tax years 2015 and 2016.
The analysis excludes part-time employees and is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2015 and 2016 populations.

While there is no comparator index or group of companies that truly reflects the activities of the Group, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector Index the constituent members of which are all property holding and or development companies or real estate investment trusts within the UK, was chosen as it reflects trends within the UK property market generally and tends to be the index against which analysts judge the performance of the Company.

SAYE During the year under review, no new SAYE awards were granted to the Executive Directors.
Exit payments made in the year audited The terms of Mark Allans exit were set out in an agreement at the time he gave notice to the Company.
In formalising this agreement, the Committee sought to ensure that the outcomes were fair to shareholders, to the Company and to Mark Allan, taking into account the terms of his departure and his service to Unite over his 17 years of employment with the Group, including almost 10 years as Chief Executive.
The agreement also set out some additional undertakings which included remaining with the business in an advisory capacity until 31 October 2016 to support the new Chief Executive, as well as strengthened non-compete and non-poach arrangements, all of which were considered to be in the interests of the Company and of our shareholders.
For the period 1 June 2016 to 31 October 2016, Mark Allan continued to receive base pay 201,476, pension 32,417 and other contractual benefits 7,884 totalling 241,777.
He was not eligible to participate in the 2016 annual bonus and there was no payment in lieu of notice.
For the purposes of outstanding long-term incentives, Mark Allan was not considered a good leaver, with the default policy position dictating that all of his outstanding awards would lapse upon leaving the Company, unless the Committee would determine otherwise.
Reflecting a number of considerations set out below, the Committee exercised discretion to allow vesting of LTIP awards that had already been performance tested and were within a few days of vesting at the time he made his announcement.
This use of discretion took into account that: r The relevant awards would have ordinarily vested three days after the official announcement of the change in Chief Executive i. e. 10 April 2016, but that Mark elected to announce as early as possible in order to permit an orderly handover of his duties r The applicable performance periods had been completed and vesting was strong under each cycle and r Other elements of Marks package were minimised under the terms of the compromise agreement.
Namely no annual bonus would be payable in respect of 2016, and the previously announced 6% salary increase would instead be kept in line with general increases across the group at 2%.

All other outstanding and unvested awards i. e. the final third of his 2013 LTIP awards, and each of the 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards lapsed following Marks resignation.

Implementation of Executive Director remuneration policy for 2017 Base salary The Committee has approved the following salary increases with effect from 1 March 2017: Base salary from Base salary from 1 June 2016 to 28 1 March 2017 to 28 Percentage Executive Director February 2017 February 2018 increase R S Smith 430,000 438,600 2% J J Lister 350,000 357,000 2% R C Simpson 325,000 331,500 2% Proposed salary increases are consistent with the average increase applied across the Group c. 2%.

Financial 75% Adjusted EPS 25.0% Total return per share 25.0% Net debt to EBITDA ratio 25.0% Non-financial 25% Customer satisfaction 12.5% University Reputation 12.5% The performance related annual bonus for the 2017 financial year will operate on broadly the same basis as in 2016.
The Committee has approved an unchanged maximum bonus opportunity for each executive of 144% of salary, consisting of a maximum of 120% of salary under the corporate element and a maximum individual multiplier of 1.2x.
For 2017, the corporate element of the annual bonus will continue to be based on a combination of financial and non-financial measures, weighted 75% and 25% respectively.
The Committee intends to supplement customer satisfaction with a measure based on University Reputation, with each weighted 12.5%.
The inclusion of University Reputation recognises the equal importance of Unites relationships with Higher Education partners, together with the opinions of our student customers directly, and has been used as an operational KPI for a number of years.
It is also intended that the majority of 2017 objectives under the individual performance multiplier will be shared across each of the Executive Directors.
Proposed target levels have been set to be challenging relative to business plan, although specific targets are deemed to be commercially sensitive at this time.
It is the Committees current intention to disclose these targets, and the key achievements by each Executive Director, retrospectively in the 2017 Directors Remuneration Report.
Annual bonuses will continue to be paid in cash, unless the recipient has not met their shareholding guidelines, in which case up to 50% of the amount payable will be satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company, deferred for three years.
Clawback and malus provisions apply to all awards.
92 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED LTIP For 2017, the LTIP will continue to operate broadly on the same basis as in the 2016 financial year.
The Committee, having considered the performance of the Company and other relevant factors, intends that Executive Directors will each receive an award equivalent to a maximum of 200% of salary delivered through a combination of the PSP and ESOS, with the final level of vesting dependent on the achievement of three-year performance targets relating to EPS, TR and TSR, as follows: Measure Weighting Targets 2019 Adjusted earnings 1 3 0% vesting below 36 pence per share EPS 25% vesting for 36 pence 100% vesting for 42 pence or more: Straight line vesting between these points Total return TR per share 1 3 0% vesting below 7% p. a. p. a.

Full vesting under each element will require continued exceptional performance over the next three years.
Any awards vesting for performance will be subject to an additional two-year holding period, during which time clawback provisions will also apply.
Further details of the grant date and number of interests awarded will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy for 2017 Chairman and Non-Executive Director Fees During the final quarter of 2016, the Board undertook its annual review of Non-Executive Director fees.
Following consideration of salary increases across the Group and indicative fee increases at sector and FTSE comparators, the Board determined that the basic fee should be increased from 45,000 p. a. to 45,900 p. a. and that additional fees should be increased by a similar rate, in both cases being broadly in line with increases for the broader employee population.
In respect of the Chairman of the Board, Phil White, the Committee determined that with the new executive leadership structure now in place, and given the significant increase in the size of the Company in recent years, the timing was appropriate to undertake a full market assessment of the Chairman role.
Having considered a number of reference points, including data for sector and size comparators and time commitment, the Committee recommended an increase in the fee payable to the Chairman to 185,000 p. a. which will position him around lower quartile against the blended market assessment.
The Committee considers this increase appropriate given Phils significant experience and leadership of the Company over his tenure to date.
A summary of the fee increases, which are effective 1 January 2017, is set out in the table below.
