Although only on the Groups ability to deliver progress in many of the threshold levels were achieved in respect of Group profit before key financial measures.
It is pleasing to report that many of tax and organic revenues, above target levels were achieved the longer term actions have been executed well and the for cash conversion which together with achievement against new product pipeline, operational improvements and ERP strategic and personal objectives resulted in the annual implementation have all made excellent progress in the year.

The Committee Group profit before tax has decreased by 5% to 208m while is confident that this represents a fair reflection of performance organic revenue was lower by 5% to 1,649m.
EPS was also in the context of the aforementioned challenges faced by the lower by 4% in 2016 and shareholders received a dividend of business.

60 IMI plc Directors Remuneration Report Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Committee contd What decisions were made in 2016?
The Committee reviewed remuneration arrangements for the executive directors during the year and decided that no change to remuneration policy or to structure in 2016 or 2017 is appropriate or necessary.
The Committee reviewed the base salary levels for executive directors in light of 2016 business performance and concluded that an increase of 2%, effective 1 January 2017, was appropriate and in line with the wider employee workforce.
The Chairman and non-executive director fees were also reviewed and were increased by 2%, effective 1 January 2017.
Looking forward The Committee will keep the existing remuneration policy under review to ensure it continues to support IMIs strategic objectives.
With this is mind, it is noted that the remuneration policy was last approved by shareholders in 2015 and is due to be reviewed before a policy is put to the 2018 Annual General Meeting.
This policy review will be a key area of focus for the Committee ahead of the 2018 Annual General Meeting.

66 IMI plc Directors Remuneration Report Annual Remuneration Report contd In addition, each executive director has a number of personal objectives agreed with the individual during the first quarter of the financial year, and which pertain to areas directly within their remit.
The Committee seeks to set personal objectives that are demanding and measurable, and in all cases they are subject to a robust and rigorous validation exercise at both the half and full year which take into account multiple points of reference.
These personal objectives and the Committees assessment of each executive directors performance against them is described below.

When assessing compliance with this guideline the Committee reviews both the level of beneficial share ownership and vested but unexercised share incentive awards on a post-tax basis.
Although M W Selway and D J Shook continue to make progress towards this guideline, and have a material interest in the Companys shares as can be noted in the table on page 70, as a consequence of awards not having vested the Committee has determined that half of the annual bonus payable to M W Selway and D J Shook shall be delivered in shares which must be held for a period of at least three years and until the shareholding guideline has been met.
