Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP Joint Ownership Awards have been made under the JSOP consisting of a joint interest in the shares subject to certain terms and conditions.
The Ordinary Shares subject to Joint Ownership Awards are already in issue and areheld by an Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
Under the terms, the participants interest in the jointly owned shares entitles the participant to share inthe proceeds of sale of the jointly owned shares up to the aggregate of the participants subscription amount and the value in excess of a set hurdle.
Each participant was required to pay a subscription amount for the jointly owned shares equal to the market value of the participants interest as determined by HMRC.
In accordance with the terms of the JSOP, such amount was left outstanding as a liability to the Company.
As a preparatory step to admission in April 2014, the Company called for all outstanding subscription amounts on the jointly owned shares to be paid up in full.
In order to facilitate this, the Company has made a loan to the Chairman, Executive Directors and other participants, the amount of which was equal to their outstanding subscription.
Theloans become due for repayment at the latest by the date on which the jointly owned shares are disposed ofand termination of continued employment.
When the shares vest, ifthe value of the participants interest is less than the outstanding beneficial loan amount, the balance remaining on the loan once the participants interest has been deducted is no longer payable.
As detailed inthe taxable benefits section on page 65, the Company makes annual payments to reimburse participants for the income tax charge that arises on the outstanding loan amount each year.
The Joint Ownership Awards vest over time, with 25 per cent on the specified date established on grant and then equally on a quarterly or monthly basis until becoming fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the vest start date.
Once vested, the participant can require the shares subject to the Joint Ownership Award to be sold and thenet amount they receive will equal the proportion of the sale proceeds that exceeds the hurdle amount for their shareholding.
The 2014 JSOP tranches have the following vesting conditions: Amount vesting if minimum performance 1 Scheme Vesting period Vesting performance conditions achieved 2014 JSOP tranche 1 25% one year after the vesting None 100% start date and then equally on a monthly basis for the remaining three years 2014 JSOP tranche 2 As above Underlying EBITDA must be greater 100% than13.5 million for the year ended 31December 2014 2014 JSOP tranche 3 As above Underlying EBITDA must be greater 100% than15.5 million for the year ended 31December 2015 1.

At a segmental level, Underlying EBITDA also excludes intra-group franchise fee arrangements but incorporates an allocation of Group technology and central costs both of which net out on a consolidated level.
Dividends payable on the jointly owned shares are split between the participant and the EBT, in proportion to the value of their respective interests at such time.

Under shareholding guidelines implemented by the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors are required to build and then maintain a shareholding excluding shares held conditionally under any incentive arrangements but including the number of shares to the value of any vested and exercisable interest under the Companys Joint Share Ownership Plan equivalent to at least 400 per cent of base salary.
At the 2016 year end, David Buttress complied with this requirement but Paul Harrison having commenced work on 26 September 2016 did not.
Inaccordance with the Companys shareholding guidelines, Paul Harrison will be expected to retain 50 per cent of the shares vesting under all share plans, after any disposals for the payment of applicable taxes, until attaining the required level of shareholding.
