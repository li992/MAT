An ordinary resolution for approval of the Annual Statement and Report on Remuneration advisory will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The Companys auditor is required to audit certain of the disclosures provided in this Report.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated in this Report.
The independent auditors opinion is included on pages 36 to 40.
Remuneration Responsibilities The Board has resolved that a remuneration committee is not appropriate for a company of this size and nature.
Remuneration is therefore regarded as part of the Boards responsibilities to be addressed regularly.
All Directors are non-executive and all participate in meetings of the Board at which Directors remuneration is considered.
Directors Remuneration Policy The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 10 July 2015 and became effective on that date.
Fees for directors are determined by the Board within the limit stated in the Companys Articles of Association Articles.
The Articles limit the aggregate fees to 200,000 per annum, and any change to this limit would require shareholder approval by special resolution.
The directors Remuneration Policy is that the remuneration of directors should be fair and reasonable in relation to that of other investment trusts and to the time commitment and responsibilities of directors: and be sufficient to retain and motivate appointees, as well as ensure that candidates of a high calibre are recruited to the Board but not be more than necessary for the purpose.
The remuneration of directors must also take into consideration any committee memberships and chairmanship duties.
Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses properly incurred by them in the performance of their duties.
Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
Directors are not entitled to exit payments or any compensation for loss of office.
Directors do not have service contracts.
Directors are appointed under letters of appointment, copies of which are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company.
Notwithstanding the above, the Companys Articles also provide that additional discretionary payments can be made for services which, in the opinion of the directors, are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a director.
The level of directors remuneration is reviewed annually, although such review will not automatically result in any changes.
Any director undertaking more than one role will receive only the higher of the fees due for the roles they hold.
The Board may amend the remuneration paid to directors within the parameters of the Directors Remuneration Policy.
This Directors Remuneration Policy: will apply to any new directors, who will be paid the appropriate fee based on the directors fees level in place at the date of appointment: is the same in all material respects as that currently followed by the Board and summarised in the last Directors Remuneration Report: and is intended to take effect immediately upon its approval by shareholders.
The Board consider, where raised, shareholders views on directors remuneration.
The Company has no employees and consequently has no policy on the remuneration of employees.
Annual Statement on Directors Remuneration For the two years to 31 March 2016, the Directors were paid fees at the following rates: Chairman, 37,500: Audit Committee Chairman, 31,250: Senior Independent Director, 29,000: and the other Directors, 25,000.
Directors emoluments received in the current year and prior year are set out over the page.
32 PIGIT pp17 35 07 06 2016 13:37 Page 33 GOVERNANCE Directors fees were last revised with effect from 1 April 2014 following a review of the increasing demands and accountability of the corporate governance and regulatory environment and the additional workload that each Director had, and will continue, to experience.
A similar review was conducted during the year and the Board concluded that the current level of remuneration is appropriate.
No discretionary payments were made in the year, or the previous year.
