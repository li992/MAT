GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report Annual statement by the chairman of the remuneration committee It is the remuneration committees responsibility to ensure that payments to executives are appropriate and aligned with shareholder interests.
Dear shareholder On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present the remuneration committees report for 2016.
I summarise the groups performance and the resulting pay outcomes for the year ended 31 March 2016, and highlight some of the key issues that the remuneration committee considered during the year.
Performance and outcome The strategy to strengthen core brands, expand the beer category to reach more consumers on more occasions, and place an emphasis on premiumisation, created superior underlying revenue, EBITA and adjusted EPS growth for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Group net producer revenue was up 5% with group EBITA growth of 8% on an organic, constant currency basis.
Adjusted EPS increased by 12% on the same basis over the year.
It is a re ection of the dedication and focus of management and Lesley Knox employees that this performance has been achieved in spite of the Chairman of the remuneration committee distraction of the recommended AB InBev offer.
In terms of TSR, we remain ahead of our competitors, with growth of 115% over the five years to 31 March 2016.
100 invested in SABMiller five years ago was worth 215 on 31 March 2016, compared with 202 if invested in the median of our peer group, or only 126 if invested in the FTSE 100 index.
Furthermore, 100 invested in SABMiller upon our listing in London in 1999 would have been worth 1,477 on 31March 2016.
Value of 100 invested 5 years ago SABMiller 215 Underlying revenue, EBITA and adjusted EPS growth resulted in above 1 April 2011 Peer median 202 target bonuses for the year.
However, the translational impact of FTSE 100 126 currency depreciation against the US dollar caused some long-term 240 incentive awards with three to five-year performance periods to lapse 220 200 with a nil payout.
Adjusted EPS increased by 9% per annum over the 180 last three years, on a constant currency basis, but the continued 160 strengthening of the US dollar being the currency in which we report 140 our group results eroded those gures to show a decline in reported 120 adjusted EPS of 2% per annum, which is below the threshold 100 performance levels necessary for share options and performance 80 31 Mar 1 Apr 31 Mar 31 Mar 31 Mar 31 Mar shares to vest.

The committee retains the discretion to appoint a new executive director on a notice period of up to 24 months reducing to 12 months during the first year, such that after 12 months service the notice period would have reverted to the standard 12 months.

Copies of the relevant service contracts or letters of appointment can be viewed at the companys registered of ce, or in the case of service contracts, on the companys website at www.
Recruitment policy The committee will pay no more than it considers necessary to attract appropriate candidates, and it is not contemplated that remuneration will need to be different from the structure or exceed the limits set out in the remuneration policy table.
The maximum variable remuneration will be in line with that set out in the policy table on pages 76 and 77.
For internal appointments, the committee may allow any unvested long-term incentive awards upon appointment to remain subject to the original performance conditions and vesting timescale applicable to those awards.
For external appointments, where a newly appointed executive director forgoes a bonus or long-term incentive award or similar upon leaving a previous employer, the committee will determine the expected value of the amounts forgone taking into account any performance conditions and duration until vesting, and may pay compensation in cash, in SABMiller shares, or an award of long-term incentives, but, in any event, the total compensation amount will not exceed the expected value of the amounts forgone.
Furthermore, any such compensation will be subject to forfeiture and clawback if the executive leaves the company voluntarily within a xed time period determined by the committee, being not less than two years.
Compensation for amounts forgone upon recruitment is not payable to non-executive directors.
78 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2016 G GO OV five ER RN NA AN NC CE E Termination policy The committees approach, when considering payments in the event of termination, is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, any contractual or other legal obligations, and the relevant share plan and pension scheme rules.
The overriding principle is that there should be no reward for failure.

Policy on external appointments Each executive director is permitted to accept a non-executive directorship in another company, subject to the prior approval of the board.
This will normally be limited to one appointment.
Fees received in respect of external appointments may be retained by the individual.
Currently, no executive director has non-executive directorships in external companies.
Pay and employment conditions across the group The company operates in a number of different locations with employees paid by reference to applicable market rates, and base pay reviewed annually.
The ratio between xed and variable pay for employees differs by level, geographic location and business unit.
Variable performancerelated pay and share plans operate across the group but may differ in terms of structure, award levels and performance measures.
Long-term incentives on similar terms to executive directors are cascaded to the other executive committee members, and to around 1,700 other employees in the group.
Employment conditions and bene ts are determined according to the local market to enable high standards of health and safety and employee wellbeing.
The company does not consult directly with employees when determining directors remuneration, but undertakes regular employee engagement surveys which provide a mechanism for feedback on a number of issues, including remuneration.
Furthermore, many employees are also shareholders in SABMiller, and are able to participate in the votes on directors remuneration.
Remuneration comparison measurements are not used routinely, because of the inconsistencies in comparing pay levels across different geographies and workforce pro les.
Discretion and judgement Discretion is necessary to ensure that outcomes remain appropriate in all the circumstances, including those not anticipated by the remuneration policy.
Mechanistic or formulaic remuneration outcomes are not always appropriate in context, and the committee may exercise discretion to adjust a payment, performance metric or targets in exceptional circumstances.
Judgement is applied by the committee in setting performance targets to ensure they are suf ciently stretching, and to alter performance metrics and targets if they are no longer a fair measure of performance providing any new metrics and targets are not materially less challenging than the originals.
The committee has discretion to interpret the rules of any remuneration plan, and to determine the participation and level of the awards including the extent of vesting of awards under certain leaver situations.
The committee also maintains discretion to adjust share awards in the event of a variation of capital, and to determine the treatment in the event of a corporate transaction, including whether incentives vest in full, or in part, or lapse completely, or are rolled over into replacement awards, and how any special dividend might be treated.
If there is required to be a material restatement of financial results other than due to a change in accounting policy, misconduct or other action causing harm to the reputation of the company, the committee has the discretion to adjust, forfeit or clawback payments and awards in respect of a participant, a group of participants, or all participants.

Advisers to the remuneration committee External advisers Kepler Associates is appointed by the committee, following a competitive tender, to provide independent advice on remuneration matters including current market practices, incentive design, performance measures, and independent monitoring of TSR.
During the year Kepler Associates became a brand of Mercer.
Both Kepler Associates and Mercer are founding members and signatories of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants.
The committee reviews the advice provided by Kepler Associates to satisfy itself that it is independent.
Kepler Associates does not provide any other advice to the group, and fees are charged on a time basis.
Total fees for support to the committee during the year ended 31 March 2016 were 102,150.
Market data is sourced by the group compensation & benets function from a number of consultancies, including Towers Watson, Mercer and Hay Group to provide context for the committee.
Other than Kepler Associates, the provision of information to the committee by other providers is incidental to their main function of advising the group compensation & benets function on the remuneration of employees outside the scope of this report.
Internal advisers The committee considers the views of the Chairman and the Chief Executive on the remuneration and performance of other members of the executive committee.
The Group Company Secretary, the General Counsel, the Group Human Resources Director, and the Group Compensation & Benets Director also provide information and advice to the committee on legal, regulatory and governance issues, and on the pay and conditions for employees throughout the group.

84 SABMiller plc Annual Report 2016 G GO OV five ER RN NA AN NC CE E Share option plan Outcome for the year ended 31 March 2016 audited Share options provide a direct and transparent link between executive pay and value creation for shareholders, as no gains are possible unless there has been an absolute increase in the share price.
Furthermore, to ensure that any share price increase is supported by a sustainable improvement in the groups underlying financial performance, additional performance conditions are applied before vesting of: two-thirds of the share options after three years: and one-third of the share options after five years.
If these performance conditions are not met, the appropriate proportion of share options will lapse, and there is no opportunity for retesting.
The vesting of share options for the executive directors for the performance periods ended 31 March 2016 is shown in the table below, which includes share options granted in respect of their services as employees rather than as, or in contemplation of their appointment as, executive directors.
Share options vesting shortly after the year end with performance periods ended 31 March 2016 have lapsed with a nil payout because the required performance threshold was not achieved.

If there is a change of control during the year ending 31 March 2017, TSR outperformance of the median of a comparator group will be measured through to change of control, and any shares vesting on a change of control will be pro-rated.
The number of shares which can be released under a value share award is dependent upon TSR outperformance compared with the median of a comparator group identi ed on page 86 over three, four and five-year performance periods: at median or below median TSR performance, no shares will vest: and for every 10 million of additional shareholder value created, a predetermined xed number of shares will vest as set out in the table above.
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2016 91 GOVERNANCE Directors remuneration report continued | Annual report on remuneration continued Additional shareholder value represents the amount of additional return to shareholders as a result of the companys TSR performance exceeding the median of the comparator group.
It is calculated as the percentage change in TSR of the company, less the percentage change in TSR of the median of the comparator group, multiplied by the companys market capitalisation at the commencement of the performance period.
The maximum number of shares that can vest is capped at the level at which additional shareholder value at the end of each performance period equals the market capitalisation of the company at the commencement of the performance period.
The maximum value for all participants including executive directors in the aggregate is therefore capped at 0.5% of additional shareholder value created for any five-year performance period.
This is the maximum theoretical percentage that can be earned in aggregate by all participants, with 99.5% of the additional value created accruing to shareholders.
Value share awards granted before 2013 vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to TSR outperformance, but participants may request the release of all or part of the award from the third anniversary of the grant date.
If the committee exercises its discretion to release shares in such circumstances, the number of shares is determined based on TSR outperformance to that date, with the shares partially deferred and released in equal instalments over the period until the fifth anniversary of the grant date.
There is no opportunity for retesting against future TSR performance, and the deferred shares are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances should the participants employment terminate before the fifth anniversary.
Value share awards granted from 2013 vest one-third on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date respectively.
Any shares are then released, based on TSR outperformance to the preceding 31 March.
If the performance conditions for any award are not achieved at the relevant date, the appropriate proportion of shares will lapse and there is no opportunity for retesting.
At 31 March 2016, TSR outperformance, additional shareholder value created, and the indicative value of shares capable of vesting for the highest paid executive Alan Clark were: Performance period commencing 1 April 2011 1 April 2012 1 April 2013 1 April 2014 1 April 2015 SABMillers TSR to 31 March 2016 114.963% 87.503% 46.071% 40.837% 19.701% Comparator group median TSR to 31 March 2016 102.058% 103.698% 42.741% 30.258% 11.254% Outperformance 12.905% nil 3.330% 10.579% 8.447% SABMiller market capitalisation at commencement 33,485m 37,639m 47,580m 48,459m 56,264m of the performance period Additional shareholder value created 4,321m nil 1,584m 5,126m 4,753m Value of shares capable of vesting at 42.56 per share 2.1m nil 0.8m 2.7m 2.5m Value of shares as % of additional shareholder value created 0.05% 0.05% 0.05% 0.05% Approval This report complies with the requirements of the regulations.
