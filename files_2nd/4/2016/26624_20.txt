DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY 3.1 Executive directors remuneration policy Aligning the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders and with Man Groups strategic goals is central to Man Groups remuneration policy.
In line with shareholders interests being managed within a robust governance framework, the Company aims to retain and incentivise high calibre executive directors by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with a short-term annual bonus and a long-term deferred bonus linked to: profits and contribution: the achievement of individual objectives which are consistent with the strategy of the Company and building sustainable profitability: the achievement of long-term strategic KPIs in line with the long-term focus of the Company: the creation of long-term shareholder value: ongoing oversight of a robust risk management framework: maintenance of strong capital and liquidity positions: and addition of senior talent, building succession for leadership and setting a strong governance structure for the Boards delegated authorities.
This section of the report sets out the remuneration policy for executive and non-executive directors which shareholders approved at and which waseffective from the 2015 AGM, on 8 May 2015.
The remuneration policy has been included in this Annual Report in full using updated data in the scenario charts and showing the revised lower DEIP maximum to provide the context within which the Committee has conducted its work during the year and has been updated, since 2015, for the inclusion of clawback provisions in respect of incentive awards.
The policy has also been updated to reflect the provisions contained in Luke Ellis and Mark Jones service contracts.

The Remuneration Committee may adjust the weighting or definition of the above performance criteria from time to time, to reflect changes in strategic priorities.
Notes to the policy table: In implementing the above remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee shall have regard to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UKLA Listing Rules, the Financial Conduct Authority Remuneration Code of practice on remuneration policies, the AIFM Remuneration Code, and to leading investor representative body guidelines including the Investment Association, ISS and the PLSA.
Please note that any commitments made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy approved by shareholders will be honoured.
In addition to the elements of remuneration detailed in the policy table, the Remuneration Committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules see details in the paragraph Approach to recruitment remuneration.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2016 85 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Directors Remuneration report continued 3.2 Performance measures selection and approach to target-setting Annual objectives are set according to immediate priorities identified by the Board and management and will be reviewed and adjusted annually to reflect changing priorities.
The long-term performance metrics are in line with the long-term strategic focus of the Company and will be reviewed as required in line with any changes in strategic direction.
3.3 Differences between executive directors and employees remuneration Executive Committee members are eligible to participate in the Executive Incentive Plan alongside executive directors to align the remuneration of the most senior management.
However, in line with market practice in alternative investment funds, their incentive payouts are uncapped.
Employee remuneration includes base salary, benefits, an annual performance bonus and, for senior contributors, long-term share and fund-based deferrals.
The level of deferral increases as total compensation increases.
This provides alignment with shareholders and the future performance of the Company and with the interests of investors in funds managed by the Company.
Sales staff have a specific bonus scheme to incentivise appropriate asset raising and retention, whilst aligning interests on costs.
3.4 Shareholding guidelines In order to align the interests of executive directors and shareholders, Man Group requires its executive directors to maintain a proportion of Man Group shares calculated with reference to their base salary.
The Chief Executive Officer is required to maintain a shareholding of 200% of base salary.
Other executive directors are required to maintain a shareholding of 100% of base salary.
Executive directors are required to build up this shareholding on joining the Board and after a reduction in share price.
Incumbents will build up to the prescribed shareholdings with post-tax vested shares where not already at or above this level.
In addition, as explained in Table R24, the long-term deferred bonus element of the Executive Incentive Plan has been designed so that executive directors have the potential to build up over time a significant holding of unvested shares, subject to ongoing service, which are fully aligned with shareholder experience and value.
However, these shares are not taken into account in the calculation of the level of directors holdings measured against our shareholding guidelines which require the holding of totally unrestricted and disposable shares.
3.5 Non-executive directors remuneration policy Non-executive directors have formal letters of appointment.
These do not contain any notice provisions or provision for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment is terminable on six months notice.
The Boards policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial three-year term, subject to retirement and reappointment by shareholders annually at the AGM, which may be followed by a further three years by mutual agreement.
Any further extension will be subject to rigorous review.
The initial dates of appointment of the non-executive directors to the Board are shown on pages 48 and 49 of this 2016 Annual Report, and their current fee levels are provided in the DRR on page 83.
Non-executive directors are also encouraged to build a shareholding in the Company.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below.

86 Man Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 3.6 Illustrative pay for performance scenarios Although executive directors will be assessed individually for their short-term awards, the chart below provides an illustration of some of the potential 2018 reward opportunities for executive directors in respect of the 2017 performance year, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, mid-point and maximum.
PROJECTED PAY UNDER THREE PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS $000 TABLE R26 Maximum 13% 34% 53% $9,753 CEO Mid-point 24% 30% 46% $5,537 Minimum 100% $1,320 13% Maximum 13% 34% 53% $6,650 President Mid-point 24% 30% 46% $3,775 Minimum 100% $900 13% Maximum 13% 34% 53% $4,655 CFO Mid-point 24% 30% 46% $2,643 Minimum 100% $630 13% n Salary & bene ts n Annual cash EIP n Long-term EIP Assumptions used: The minimum scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits as disclosed in the single figure of total remuneration i. e. fixed remuneration which are the only elements of the executive directors remuneration packages not linked to performance during the year under review.
The mid-point scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a bonus payout of 150% of salary for the short-term award being half of the maximum short-term award and a deferred bonus award of 233.5% of salary being half of the maximum deferred award.
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a full bonus payout of the maximum of 300% of salary for the short-term annual cash bonus award and the maximum of 467% of salary for the deferred bonus award.
The illustrations are based on initial award value and do not, therefore, reflect potential share price appreciation or any dividends received over the deferral periods.

Executive Incentive Plan The remuneration structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees 300% of salary with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment Short-term annual cash bonus overthe year.
Executive Incentive Plan New appointees may be granted awards under the long-term deferred bonus on the 467% of salary Long-term deferred bonus same terms as other executive directors, as described in the policy table.
The performance periods used for determining the awards will be gradually increased until the new appointee has completed three full financial years at Man Group.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2016 87 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Directors Remuneration report continued 3.7 Approach to recruitment remuneration continued In determining the appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both Man Group and its shareholders.
With respect to a new appointment the Remuneration Committee may buy out incentive arrangements, including bonuses, forgone on leaving a previous employer, and awards made under such buy out arrangements may be in addition to the remuneration outlined in the table above.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to those incentive arrangements and the likelihood of those conditions being met.
In defining the size of this buy out award, the Remuneration Committee would ensure that its fair value is no higher than the fair value of the incentive arrangements forgone.
The Remuneration Committee may also consider it appropriate to structure any such buy out award differently to the structure described in the policy table including whether appropriate performance conditions should apply, exercising the discretion available under the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend that such buy out awards will be made as a matter of routine: on the contrary, although the Remuneration Committee cannot anticipate every circumstance which it might face in the future, it is expected that any such awards made under the UKLA Listing Rules will only be contemplated in exceptional circumstances, will be reviewed and approved by the full Board and described fully in the subsequent years DRR.
Internal appointment For the appointment of a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committees approach will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, the Company will continue to honour these commitments.
3.8 Non-executive directors When recruiting a new non-executive director, the Board will utilise the policy as set out in Table R25 on page 86.
A base fee in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as a member or Chairman of a Board Committee.
3.9 Service contracts and exit payment policy SERVICE CONTRACTS TABLE R28 Element Condition Contract dates Luke Ellis: 1 September 2016 Mark Jones: 1 January 2017 Jonathan Sorrell: 28 September 2012 Current appointment No fixed term Notice period by either Company or director Luke Ellis: 12 months Mark Jones: 6 months Jonathan Sorrell: 6 months The Companys policy is that notice periods will not exceed 12 months Contractual entitlement to fixed bonus or None share-based incentive Provisions for contract termination Under all contracts the Company can opt to terminate immediately by making a payment in lieu of the notice period or part of it.
Luke Ellis contract requires payment of base salary only in lieu.
Jonathan Sorrells contract requires payment of base salary plus the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits in lieu.
Mark Jones contract requires payment of base salary plus a cash sum in lieu of pension contributions and other insured benefits.
Payments in lieu are to be made in monthly instalments unless the Company and the executive director agree otherwise.
Unless the Company decides otherwise the executive directors have a duty to mitigate their losses arising from termination of their employment: any replacement earnings earned in what would otherwise have been the notice period will reduce the obligation on the Company to make payments in lieu.
Short-term annual cash bonus The service contracts do not oblige the Company to pay any cash bonus to executive directors and bonuses are awarded at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Payment of any cash bonus is conditional upon the executive director being in employment and not under notice at the payment date.
Long-term deferred bonus and other awards The treatment of deferred bonuses and other long-term awards is governed by the relevant Plan rules as explained below.
88 Man Group plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements 3.9 Service contracts and exit payment policy continued To protect Man Groups business interests the executive directors service contracts contain covenants which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and their ability to solicit senior employees.
Luke Ellis has also entered into a broader non-compete covenant for an agreed period post termination.
Further, the Board has the right, at its discretion, to require Jonathan Sorrell and Mark Jones to comply with a broader non-compete covenant for up to six months post termination to provide additional protection for the Company.
If the Board exercises this right, the Company will pay an additional amount up to six months base salary and the value of pension contributions or alternative cash allowance and certain other insured benefits so that they are not left without income during the time when the Board wishes the non-compete to operate.
This amount is paid in two equal instalments and is reduced by any payments made in lieu of notice.
Executive directors service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
When considering exit payments, the Remuneration Committee reviews all outstanding incentive awards and assesses outcomes that are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how long-term deferred awards are typically treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the Remuneration Committees discretion.
LONG-TERM DEFERRED BONUS AND OTHER SHARE AWARDS TABLE R29 Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Calculation of vesting payment 1 Good leaver Follows normal vesting schedule except in Awards vest on a time pro rata basis under the case of death where the Remuneration the long-term deferred bonus of the Executive Committee may allow early vesting.
Any other reason All awards lapse.
1 Good leaver reasons include death, retirement, ill-health, injury or disability, redundancy, sale of the Company or business in which the individual was employed, leaving with agreement of the Company if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that an orderly handover has been organised and performed.
The Remuneration Committee may also decide, in its discretion, to grant good leaver status in other exceptional circumstances and will take into account the reason for leaving and the executive directors performance up to the date employment ceases.
3.10 External appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, executive directors may accept a limited number of external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive directors, including associated fees, are provided in the Directors Remuneration report for the relevant year.
3.11 Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company In assessing executive director remuneration, internal relativities within the Company are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
These internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
3.12 Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee takes into account shareholder views received in relation to remuneration resolutions to be considered at the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly.
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback an important input when forming remuneration policy and regularly reviews Man Groups remuneration policy against the guidelines of key institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The above remuneration policy was discussed with a number of Man Groups major shareholders and certain shareholder voting bodies in early 2015 and reflects the views expressed in that consultation.
As set out in more detail in the report, the application of the policy, with respect to the short-term cash bonus and the maximum award under the DEIP, has been changed for 2016 and 2017, in response to shareholder feedback.
The Committee intends to undertake a formal review of the policy, commencing immediately after the 2017 AGM, in May, prior to seeking shareholder approval for a new policy at the 2018 AGM.
