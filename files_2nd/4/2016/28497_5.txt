Under these rules, the Committee has discretion in the following areas: awards may be granted in the form of conditional share awards, nil-cost options or other arrangements having the same economic effect: awards may incorporate the right to receive in cash or shares the value of dividends on the number of shares that vest under an award in respect of record dates between grant and vesting of awards, which may assume the reinvestment of these dividends in the Companys shares on a cumulative basis: in the event of a variation of the Companys share capital, demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in theCommittees opinion, may affect the value of the Companys shares, the terms of awards may be adjusted: awards may be settled in cash: the plan rules allow for the terms of awards to be amended in accordance with the rules at the Committees discretion: andany performance condition applicable to PSP awards may be amended if an event occurs which in the case of awards granted prior to September 2014 reasonably causes the Committee to consider it appropriate, provided that, in the Committees opinion, the amended condition is not materially less difficult to satisfy or in the case of awards granted on orafter September 2014 causes the Committee to consider it is no longer appropriate, in which case it may amend or vary the condition in such manner as it determines is reasonable and produces a measure of performance which is more appropriate and materially no easier to satisfy.

For these purposes, the term payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to anaward over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committees discretion includes discretion to determine, in accordance with the rules of the PSP, the extent to which awards under that plan may vest in the event of a change of control or in a good leaver circumstance.
Prior to the adoption by the Company of the PSP in 2008, Executive Directors and certain other senior executives were generally eligible for the grant of options under the PZ Cussons Plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
There have been no grants of options under the Executive Share Option Scheme since the introduction of the Performance Share Plan and it is not expected that any further awards will be made under this scheme but certain options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme have vested and remain capable of exercise.
The Committee may make minor changes to this Policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation or implementation, taking into account the interests of Shareholders but without the need to seek Shareholder approval.
setting executive director remuneration When considering how to position the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers market data from UK-listed companies of a similar size and complexity.
The Committee also receives and takes into account information from the Global HR Director on pay and employment conditions applying to other Group employees when setting Executive Directors remuneration, consistent with the Groups general aim of seeking to reward all employees fairly according to the nature of their role, their performance and market forces.
In designing an appropriate incentive structure for the Executive Directors and other senior management, the Committee seeks to set challenging performance criteria which are aligned with the Groups business strategy and the generation of sustained shareholder value.
The Committee is also mindful of the need to avoid inadvertently encouraging risky or irresponsible behaviour including behaviour which could raise environmental, social or governance issues.
indd 14 18 08 2016 16:30 PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2016 15 Balance of fixed versus variable remuneration The Committee believes that an appropriate proportion of the executive remuneration package should be variable and performance-related in order to encourage and reward superior corporate and individual performance.
The following charts illustrate executive remuneration in specific performance scenarios.
For share based awards no share price growth or dividend payments have been included.

To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required, the Committee may make an award to buy out variable remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including the form of award, any performance conditions and the time over which the award would have vested.
Recruitment awards will normally be liable to forfeiture or clawback on early departure.
For Executive Directors, early departure is defined as being within the first two years of employment.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new Executive Directors excluding buy out arrangements in respect of their recruitment will be in line with the maximum level of variable pay that may be awarded under the Annual Bonus Plan and Performance Share Plan, a total face value opportunity of 300 per cent of salary.
The Committee will ensure that such awards arelinked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not met.
Appropriate costs and support will be covered if the recruitment requires relocation of the individual.
Executive Director contracts and loss of office payments Executive Directors have one year rolling service contracts and no Executive Director has a notice period in excess of one year or containing any provision for pre-determined compensation on termination exceeding one years salary and benefits in kind.
Upon the termination of an Executive Directors employment, the Committees approach to determining any payment for loss of office will normally be guided by the following principles: the Committee shall seek to find an outcome which is in the best interests of the Company and Shareholders as a whole, taking into account the specific circumstances: relevant contractual obligations, as set out above, shall be observed or taken into account: the Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith to satisfy an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of any such obligation or to settle or compromise any claim or costs arising in connection with the employment of an Executive Director or their termination: and the treatment of outstanding variable remuneration shall be as determined by the relevant plan rules, as set out on page 16.

Deferred bonus awards will normally vest in full on a takeover or winding up of the Company.
In the event of a special dividend, demerger or similar event the Committee may determine that awards vest on the same basis.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards may be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding.
Similarly, in the event of a merger of equals, the Committee may invite participants to voluntarily exchange their awards that would otherwise vest for equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company.
The Committee may, in the circumstances referred to above, determine to what extent any bonus should be paid in respect of the financial year in which the relevant event takes place, taking into account the extent to which the Committee determines the relevant performance metrics have been or would have been met.
statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the company When reviewing and setting Executive Director remuneration, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of all employees of the Group.
The Group-wide pay review budget is one of the key factors when reviewing the salaries of the Executive Directors.
Although the Group has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration, it does comply with local regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly.
communication with shareholders The Remuneration Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with Shareholders and seeks the views of significant Shareholders when any major changes are being made to remuneration arrangements.
The Committee takes into account the views of significant Shareholders when formulating and implementing the Policy.

3 Details of the performance measures and weightings as well as results achieved under the annual bonus arrangements in place in respect of the year are shown below.
4 The awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2013 will wholly lapse, such that the Executive Directors will receive no value.
Details of the performance measures as well as results achieved are shown below.
5 With effect from 1 June 2008, the Executive Directors became eligible for membership of the Companys defined contribution pension arrangement.
Messrs Kanellis and Leigh each elected, with the permission of the Committee, to receive instead a salary supplement equivalent to 20 per cent of base salary: these amounts are included in the column headed Pension.
Mr Davis continues to participate in the defined contribution pension arrangement but as the amount of Company contributions was less than 20 per cent of his salary, the difference between those contributions and 20 per cent of his base salary was paid as a salary supplement.
Both the pension contributions and the salary supplement are included in the column headed Pension.
The Company provides unfunded, unapproved pension benefits for Messrs Davis and Leigh as their benefits would have been subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap introduced by the Finance Act 1989 had the earnings cap not been abolished by the Finance Act 2004.
In January 2016, Mr Leigh took a cash equivalent transfer value of benefits in the PZ Cussons Directors Retirement Benefits Plan and he subsequently received a cash lump sum in lieu of his unfunded contractual promise held with the Company on a no gain, no loss basis.
As a result, Mr Leigh had no remaining pension entitlements in the PZ Cussons defined benefit plans as at 31 May 2016.
The total of the cash equivalent transfer value paid and the cash lump sum was 2,446,000.
6 Mr Nicolson was appointed to the Board on 1 May 2016.
7 Mr Steel retired from the Board on 23 September 2014. individual elements of remuneration Base salary Base salaries for individual Executive Directors are reviewed annually, with effect from 1 September, by the Remuneration Committee and are set with reference to the scope of the role and the markets in which PZ Cussons operates, the performance and experience of the individual, pay levels in other organisations of a similar size and complexity and pay increases elsewhere in the Group.
From 1 September 2016 the base salary of each of the Executive Directors will increase by 2 per cent, this being within the range of salary increases across the Group.
indd 18 18 08 2016 16:30 PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2016 19 non-executive director fees As reported in last years Report, following the biennial review of Non-executive Director fees on 1 June 2015, the annual fees payable in respect of the chairmanship of principal standing committees were adjusted to better reflect market practice in comparable companies.
As a result, with effect from 1 June 2015 the fees payable to Mr Arnold increased by 7,500 to 65,000 to reflect his role as Senior Independent Director and his chairmanships of the Audit and Group Risk Committees subsequently consolidated into one Audit and Risk Committee, the annual fees payable to Mrs Owers increased by 5,000 to 62,500 to reflect her role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and the annual fees payable to Ms Edozien increased by 7,500 to 60,000 to reflect her appointment as Chair of the CSR Committee subsequently renamed the Good4Business Committee.
The annual fees payable to each of Mr Harvey and Mrs Silver remained unchanged on 1 June 2015.
During the year, the annual fees payable to Mrs Silver increased by 12,500 to reflect her appointment on 1 January 2016 as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and Senior Independent Director.
Upon his retirement from these roles, the annual fees payable to Professor Arnold reduced by the same amount on 1 January 2016.
No other changes were made during the year to the fees payable to Non-executive Directors.
annual bonus Bonus for the year ended 31 may 2016 In respect of the year ended 31 May 2016, each of the Executive Directors participated in the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under this scheme, the CEO was eligible to earn a cash bonus of up to 150 per cent of base salary and the CFO and COO were each eligible to earn a cash bonus of up to 125 per cent of base salary.
Any bonus awards earned in excess of 100 per cent of base salary are deferred into Company shares vesting three years after the award is determined, subject to malus provisions and continued employment.
The on-target element of the annual bonus representing 60 per cent of maximum opportunity was dependent on the achievement of stretching profit before tax and exceptional items, net working capital and operating contribution margin performance targets.
A bonus was only payable in circumstances where a minimum financial performance gateway of 90 per cent of target profit before tax and exceptional items was achieved.
Subject to that gateway being attained, Executive Directors earned a bonus in respect of each financial target on a sliding scale basis once a minimum of 90 per cent of each target was achieved.
The balance 40 per cent of maximum bonus opportunity was dependent on delivery of a profit before tax and exceptional items stretch target and certain non-financial objectives.
Over the year, the Company achieved the following performance for the on-target element: profit before tax and exceptional items of 103.0 million target: 108.4 million : a net working capital margin of 24.8 per cent target: 20.2 per cent : and an operating contribution margin of 17.4 per cent target: 17.4 per cent.
On this basis, in relation to the on-target element of the annual bonus the Executive Directors earned 30 per cent of their maximum bonus opportunity.
This comprised 21 per cent in respect of the profit before tax and exceptional items target, 0 per cent in respect of the net working capital margin target and 9 per cent in respect of operating contribution margin target.
The non-financial objectives for the year related to progress on the introduction of the Groups revised operating model, the deployment of SAP, entry into certain new export markets, the development of talent and succession planning and CSR objectives related to reduction in carbon emissions and water consumption.
These objectives were largely attained and the Executive Directors therefore earned 17 per cent of maximum bonus opportunity for this element.
The profit before tax and exceptional items stretch target was not attained and so 0 per cent of this element was earned.
Overall, each of the Executive Directors qualified for 47 per cent of his maximum bonus opportunity.
In the case of Mr Kanellis, this resulted in a total bonus payment equivalent to 71.1 per cent of his annual basic salary whilst Messrs Davis and Leigh each qualified for a total bonus payment equivalent to 59.3 per cent of his annual basic salary.
The Committee was satisfied that bonus awards of this level were appropriate given the overall achievement of the Group during the year.
indd 19 18 08 2016 16:30 20 PZ Cussons Plc Governance and Financial Statements 2016 Governance rePort on directors remuneration ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued 2017 annual bonus framework Executive Directors will continue to participate in the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme in respect of the year ending 31 May 2017.
The Directors consider that the Groups future targets are matters which are commercially sensitive: they could provide our competitors with insights into our business plans and expectations and should therefore remain confidential to the Company at this time although they will be retrospectively disclosed in the Report on Directors Remuneration for 2017.
However, there has been no change to the level of opportunity available under the Scheme and the principal features of the Scheme are as follows: maximum opportunity remains at 150 per cent of salary for the CEO and 125 per cent of salary for the CFO and COO: any bonus awards earned in excess of 100 per cent of base salary will be deferred into Company shares vesting three years after the award is determined, subject to clawback provisions as detailed below and continued employment: the target award will remain at 60 per cent of maximum opportunity.
Annual bonuses will again be based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax and exceptional items, net working capital and operating contribution margin performance targets: 30 per cent of maximum opportunity will be available for delivering non-financial objectives subject to achieving the same profit before tax and exceptional items threshold as above: and 10 per cent of maximum opportunity will be available for delivering a profit before tax and exceptional items stretch target.
Awards made under the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme in respect of the year ending 31 May 2017 will continue to includemalus and clawback provisions which would enable the Committee to withhold or, for a period of up to two years from payment and or vesting, clawback awards made to Executive Directors and other senior executives in the event of i a material misstatement of audited results, ii employee misconduct associated with the governance or conduct of the business or iii an erroneous calculation of a performance condition.
long-term incentive plans Performance share Plan Executive Directors and certain senior executives are generally eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan which provides for the grant of conditional rights to receive nil cost shares subject to continued employment over a three year vesting period and the satisfaction of certain performance criteria established by the Committee.
The current version of the Plan, the 2014 Performance Share Plan, was approved and adopted at the 2014 Annual General Meeting: prior to this awards were made under a version of the Plan approved and adopted in 2008.
For the purposes of this Report, both versions of the Plan are referred to as the Performance Share Plan.
awards vesting in respect of the year ended 31 may 2016 The year ended 31 May 2016 represented the final year of the three year performance period for awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2013.

25 per cent of the award will vest where adjusted EPS grows by 4 per cent per annum rising on a straight line pro-rata basis to 100 per cent which vests if adjusted EPS grows by 12 per cent per annum or more, in each case compounded over the performance period.
Any awards earned in excess of 100 per cent of salary on grant will vest not at the end of the three year performance period but will be deferred and vest in equal amounts four years and five years after the date of grant.
Face value has been calculated using the average mid-market closing share price on 22 July 2015 of 353.15p which was the share price used to determine the number of shares subject to the award in accordance with the rules of the Performance Share Plan.
awards to be granted in the year ending 31 may 2017 The Committee intends to make awards under the Performance Share Plan to Executive Directors and other senior executives during the year ending 31 May 2017 on the same basis as the prior year and in line with the Companys Remuneration Policy.
Award levels remain unchanged from awards made in the previous year.
The Committee proposes to continue to make awards subject to the attainment of targets related to growth in adjusted EPS.
The minimum threshold compound EPS growth target, atwhich 25 per cent of awards will vest, will remain at compound EPS growth of 4 per cent per annum.
The target for maximum vesting will also remain unchanged at compound EPS growth of 12 per cent per annum.
The Committee has considered the introduction of an additional performance measure but has concluded that this is not currently appropriate for the Company and that EPS remains the most meaningful measure of long-term performance, providing a valuable line of sight for management and alignment with the interests of Shareholders.
In line with practice in respect of awards made under the Senior Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, awards made under the Performance Share Plan in respect of the year ending 31 May 2017 will continue to include malus and clawback provisions which would enable the Committee to withhold or, for a period of up to two years from payment and or vesting, clawback awards made to Executive Directors and other senior executives in the event of i a material misstatement of audited results, ii employee misconduct associated with the governance or conduct of the business or iii an erroneous calculation of a performance condition.
executive share option scheme Prior to the adoption by the Company of the Performance Share Plan in 2008, Executive Directors and certain other senior executives were generally eligible for the grant of options under the PZ Cussons Plc Executive Share Option Scheme.
There have been no grants of options under the Executive Share Option Scheme since the introduction of the Performance Share Plan and itis not expected that any further awards will be made under this scheme.
All options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme have now either vested and are capable of exercise or have lapsed.
statement of directors shareholding and share interests audited The Committee has established Shareholding Ownership Guidelines which require Executive Directors: to build up and retain holdings of shares and or deferred shares net of tax worth 150 per cent of salary from time to time: and until this share ownership threshold is met, to invest 50 per cent of any after-tax annual bonus into the Companys shares.
They are also required to retain shares with a value equal to 50 per cent of the net gain after tax arising from the acquisition of shares pursuant to any of the Companys share incentive plans, again until the share ownership threshold is met.
All Executive Directors have complied with the above guidelines in respect of the year ended 31 May 2016.
Richard Harvey Chairman is also required under his letter of appointment to invest 20 per cent of his fees each year in the purchase of shares in the Company and to retain such shares during the term of his appointment, which he has complied with during the current financial year.
In light of his pending retirement from the Board with effect from 31 December 2016, the Committee has resolved to release him from this obligation in respect of, only, the last quarterly fee payment which will be paid to him on or around that date.
