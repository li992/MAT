For bonus payments earned in relation to the year ended 31st March 2016 the following rules of deferral apply: For the Chief Executive and other Executive Directors, 50% of the bonus payable is awarded as shares and deferred for a period of three years.
There are no further performance conditions attached to the deferred element.
Dividend equivalent shares are paid on the proportion of any bonus awarded in shares during the deferral period.
These are paid at the end of the deferral period and are equal to the value the executive director would have received had they held the shares directly.
The Remuneration Committee is entitled to apply forfeiture to the deferred element in the case of misstatement or misconduct.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion in awarding annual bonuses to vary the level of annual bonuses from the formulaic outcome.

Mr Walkers 2013 LTIP award has a threshold opportunity of 18.75% of base salary and maximum opportunity of 125% of base salary.
The awards vest on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum.
In addition to the EPS performance condition, the Remuneration Committee considers the performance of ROIC over the performance period to ensure that earnings growth is achieved in a sustainable and efficient manner.
The 2013 LTIP award was granted with a performance range from threshold to maximum of 6%-15% CAGR in underlying EPS.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the impact of the disposal of the Gold and Silver Refining business in March 2015, the Research Chemicals business in September 2015 and the share consolidation in January 2016 on the performance ranges for in flight awards and concluded that the calculation of the growth in underlying EPS would be adjusted to reflect the impact of these events.
