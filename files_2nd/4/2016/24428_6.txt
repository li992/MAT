Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Board The Board, which is proled on pages 20 to 22, consists solely of non-executive Directors and is considered to be entirely independent.
The Board considers at least annually the level of the Boards fees, in accordance with the AIC Code.
Following a review in January 2016, non-executive Directors remuneration was increased to 35,000 per annum with additional amounts of 10,000 and 5,000 to be paid to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director respectively.
Remuneration Policy As at the date of this report, the Board comprised five Directors, all of whom are non-executive.
The Board does not have a separate Remuneration Committee as, being wholly comprised of non-executive Directors, the whole Board considers these matters.
Each Director receives a xed fee per annum based on their roles and responsibility within the Company and the time commitment required.
It is not considered appropriate that Directors remuneration should be performance related and none of the Directors are eligible for pension benets, share options, long term incentive schemes or other benets in respect of their services as non-executive Directors of the Company.
The total remuneration of non-executive Directors has not exceeded the 300,000 per annum limit set out in the Articles of Association of the Company.
The Companys Articles of Association empower the Board to award a discretionary bonus where any Director has been engaged in exceptional work on a time spent basis to compensate for the additional time spent over their expected time commitment.
The Articles of Association provide that Directors retire and offer themselves for re-election at the first AGM after their appointment and at least every three years thereafter.
In accordance with corporate governance best practice the Company expects Directors to be re-elected annually.
All of the Directors have been provided with letters of appointment which stipulate that their initial term shall be for three years, subject to re-election.
Those Directors who have served the initial term of three years have signed updated letters of appointment for a further three years, subject to re-election.
The extension of each appointment was considered by the Board, taking into account, among other matters, each Directors length of service, attendance at meetings and contribution to the Boards deliberations.
A Directors appointment may at any time be terminated by and at the discretion of either party upon 6 months written notice.
A Directors appointment will automatically end without any right to compensation whatsoever if they are not re-elected by the shareholders.
A Directors appointment may also be terminated with immediate effect and without compensation in certain other circumstances.
Being non-executive Directors, none of the Directors have a service contract with the Company.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors are available for inspection from the Companys registered ofce.
The Companys remuneration policy has applied from incorporation on 4 December 2012, and the Directors do not envisage any changes to the remuneration policy in the next accounting period.
A resolution to approve the remuneration policy will be proposed at the AGM and the Directors recommend that this policy is approved by the shareholders.
