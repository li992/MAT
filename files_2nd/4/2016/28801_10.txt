Appreciation Rights SARs over a number of shares in RIT Capital Partners plc to participants.
Following the expiry of a three-year vesting period, participants in the SAR plan are entitled to exercise their SARs and receive a payment in shares equal to the growth in value of the shares over the vesting period.
However, the exercise of a SAR is ordinarily subject to the participants continued service over the vesting period and whether the performance condition applying to the SAR is satisfied.
The Committee determines the metric for the SAR performance condition.
The current metric applied to the awards requires that the Companys TSR exceeds the growth in the RPI plus three percentage points per annum over the three-year performance period.
In the event that the performance condition is met the award vests in full.
The performance condition was chosen as a good measure of above-inflation returns to shareholders and is subject to ongoing review by the Committee.

The Group seeks to hedge its exposure under the SAR plan by using an Employee Benefit Trust to acquire shares to meet the estimated future liability.
As noted on page 34, LTIP awards are subject to clawback.
