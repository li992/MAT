Stephen Hubbard was appointed as a Director on 16 July 2014.
Additional fees were paid to Maria Moloney as Chair of the Remuneration Committee and to Chris Girling as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
In addition, Daniel Kitchen, Maria Moloney and Chris Girling were reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings in connection with the discharge of their duties, of 3,500, 8,700 and 2,600 respectively.
"109""Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Corporate Governance Report continued During the year, the Committee reviewed the Chairmans fee considering the time commitment required, responsibilities, and fees paid at companies of similar size and complexity."
In particular, the Committee, and the Board more generally, considered the demands of the role, particularly in light of the significant success of the Company over recent years, and the Chairmans strong contribution.
His experience at Workspace and his knowledge of the real estate sector are highly valued by the Board.
The Committee reviewed fees paid to Chairmen at other property companies and at companies of similar size and complexity, and was concerned that the Chairmans fee, which has only been reviewed once since the Chairman was appointed five years ago, was well below comparators.
The Committee therefore decided to increase his fee from 135,000 to 175,000, which moves the Chairmans fee to a level more competitive with comparators reviewed.
With effect from 1 April 2016, the Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee of 47,250 2015: 45,000, with an additional fee for the Audit and Remuneration Chairs of 10,500 2015: 10,000 Base salary and pension In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Committee reviews base salaries annually with any changes normally taking effect from 1 April.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the base salaries of the CEO and the CFO taking into account a wide range of factors including the external economic environment, Company and individual performance, experience, rates of salary for similar jobs in companies of a similar sector and size and overall impact on total remuneration.
Following its review, the Committee increased the CEOs salary from 450,000 to 468,000 a 4% increase and the CFOs salary from 275,000 to 286,000 a 4% increase from 1 April 2016.
The next salary review date for Executive Directors will be 1 April 2017.
The average salary increase across the Group for the year commencing 1 April 2016 is 4%.
For 2016 17, both Executive Directors will receive cash in lieu of pension of 16.5% per annum.
Annual bonus scheme audited For 2015 16, the maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors was set at 120% of basic annual salary.
The Committee sets a minimum deferral or investment each year into Workspace shares: for 2015 16 the Committee set a minimum deferral requirement of 25% of the bonus earned.
The preferred mechanism for meeting this deferral requirement is participant investment in the LTIP.
However, the Committee retains the discretion to mandate deferral of 25% of bonus earned which will vest after two years, subject to continued employment or allow executives to make an equivalent investment in the LTIP.
For 2015 16 the Committee allowed Executive Directors to make an equivalent investment in the LTIP.
The performance measures, targets and outcomes for 2015 16 Executive Director annual bonuses are shown below.
Against each measure the bonus starts to be paid on the achievement of threshold performance, increasing on a straightline basis until stretch performance is achieved, at which point the full bonus potential for that measure is earned.

25% of earned bonuses will be invested in the LTIP.
"111""Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Corporate Governance Report continued LTIP awards audited Summary of performance conditions LTIP awards are granted as performance shares of up to 100% of salary and matching share awards of up to 2 for 1 on investments in Workspace shares of up to 50% of net salary."
The maximum matching share award that may be granted to the Executive Directors is 100% of their annual basic salary.
The Company awards matching shares in respect of an amount equivalent to two times the grossed up for income tax and National Insurance amount invested by the participant in Invested Shares.
Vesting of performance shares and matching shares is based 1 3, 1 3, 1 3 on three-year relative NAV growth, relative TSR and absolute TSR.
For the 2013 and 2014 LTIP cycles, relative performance is measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
For the 2015 LTIP cycle, the Committee reviewed the LTIP comparator group and decided to exclude Agencies from the FTSE 350 Real Estate comparator group as these operate a different business model.
In addition, for any shares to vest on TSR, the Committee must satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reection of the underlying business performance of Workspace.
For LTIP awards granted in 2013 onwards, net vested LTIP shares are required to be held for one year before the shares can be sold.
2015 LTIP awards A summary of performance measures, weightings and targets for 2015 LTIP awards granted during the year is provided below: One-third One-third One-third 2 Performance Growth in Net Asset Value TSR share price growth plus Absolute TSR 1 relative to comparators reinvested dividends relative condition 1 to comparators Level of Companys % of award Companys % of award Companys % of award 3 3 3 performance percentile rank vesting percentile rank vesting performance vesting Threshold 51st percentile 20% 51st percentile 20% 8% p. a.
The comparator group for the 2015 LTIP cycle is the constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index excluding Agencies.
For any shares to vest on absolute TSR, the Companys TSR must exceed the median TSR of the comparator group over the performance period.
There is straight-line vesting between the Threshold and Maximum performance levels.
Performance conditions for the 2013 and 2014 LTIP cycles are in line with those stated in the table above.
The comparator group for these cycles is the constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.

The share price for calculating the levels of awards was 9.1408, the average mid-market closing price over the three dealing days 23, 24 and 25 June 2015, in accordance with the LTIP plan rules.
2013 LTIP vesting outcome audited The three-year performance period of 2013 LTIP awards ended on 31 March 2016.
Over the three years from 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2016, Workspaces three-year NAV growth of 38.3% p. a. placed it first 100th percentile against its comparator group the FTSE 350 Real Estate which warrants 100% of this element vesting equivalent to 33.3% of LTIP shares awarded.
Workspaces three-year TSR of 148% or 35.4% p. a. places it first 100th percentile against the FTSE 350 Real Estate which warrants 100% of this element vesting equivalent to 33.3% of LTIP shares awarded.
Workspaces three-year absolute TSR of 35.4% p. a. warrants 100% of this element vesting equivalent to 33.3% of LTIP shares awarded.
The Committee considered this together with the underlying business performance of Workspace and concluded that 100% of the 2013 LTIP shares awarded to the Executive Directors would vest.
These awards are due to vest on 26 June 2016, subject to a one-year holding period and clawback provisions.
