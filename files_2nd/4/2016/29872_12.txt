The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors should reflect the responsibilities of the Board, Directors time commitments, the experience of the Board as a whole, and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts similar in size, capital structure and investment objective.
To this end, the Nomination Committee engages independent external advisors to provide a formal review of Directors remuneration.
Any changes to fee levels as a result of this review will remain in place for a period of 3 years.
No such advice has been sought during the financial year.
The review process involves an analysis of fees paid to Directors of other companies having similar profiles to that of the Company.
This review would be submitted to the Nomination Committee and the Directors fees would be agreed for the next 3 year period subject to approval by the shareholders at the relevant AGM.
No such engagement was carried out in the financial year.
The shareholders will be asked to approve the Directors Remuneration Policy at the Companys AGM in 2017.
Directors and Officers liability insurance cover is maintained by the Company, at its expense, on behalf of the Directors.
Directors remuneration is not linked to the performance of the Company and Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits in accordance with other investment trusts.
The Directors are entitled to reclaim reasonable expenses incurred in order to perform their duties as Non-Executive Directors for the Company.
