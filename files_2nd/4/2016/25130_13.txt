STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Directors Report on Remuneration The Committee spent considerable time debating the merits of retaining two long-term incentive plans, the performance share plan PSP and the co-investment plan CIP.
Our review found that the CIP is highly valued by participants, as evidenced by the 65% plus take-up in 2016, promotes share ownership and encourages a focus on long-term performance.
We believe that the combination of the PSP and CIP at Inchcape is very effective, supports our long-term strategy COLINE MCCONVILLE and provides us with a competitive edge.

The Committee also considered the use of other performance measures to reinforce the Companys long-term objectives, including relative TSR and cash flow.

The salaries for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are set out below, together with the average increases across the Group.

Annual bonus In line with the Committees commitment to disclose bonus targets, the table on page 70 illustrates targets, performance and resulting bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors for the 2016 bonuses.
In 2016, the Executive Directors annual bonuses were assessed against a financial performance matrix of revenue and operating profit targets and an NPS multiplier.
This matrix was designed to reward stretching financial performance, while maintaining exceptional customer service.
NPS was the Groups primary measure of customer satisfaction, used to gauge the strength and loyalty of our customer relationships.
The annual bonus can be reduced if NPS falls below benchmark but is not increased for achieving or beating benchmark.
The benchmark is established each year based on the Boards assessment of what constitutes excellence in customer service.

John McConnell, the former Finance Director, received 44,338 pro-rated under the bonus plan as part of his termination payment.
Further details can be found on page 77.
Annual bonus for 2017 The maximum annual bonus opportunity in 2017 will remain unchanged from previous years and will be 150% of salary.
The bonus for the Executive Directors will be based 80% on the same financial performance matrix as 2016 which is linked to revenue and operating profit and 20% on a basket of specific, measurable objectives that relate to the Ignite strategy.
A customer experience measure will be captured in the Ignite strategic objective, Leading in customer experience.
Therefore the NPS multiplier that operated in 2016 is no longer required.

72 Inchcape Annual Report and Accounts 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Long-term incentives for 2017 The Committee intends to continue to use EPS and ROCE as performance measures, however, we are proposing a re-weighting of measures, with 60% of an award based on three year underlying EPS growth previously 75% and 40% on ROCE previously 25% for grants made in 2017.
This reflects the Groups renewed capacity and appetite for strategic acquisitions and the Committees desire to ensure an appropriate balance between growth and returns.
The EPS range for the 2017 PSP and CIP awards will be 4% to 12% p. a reduced from 5% to 13% p. a.
The Committee believes that these targets are very stretching with the management team required to exceed industry growth levels in order to achieve a payout under the EPS element of the 2017 awards.
The Committee has also reviewed the ROCE range for the 2017 awards.
The Group has always maintained a high focus on returns including ROCE and will continue to do so.
Therefore, the target range for 2017 awards will be three year average ROCE of 22% to 26%, increased from 21% to 25%.
In response to shareholder feedback, the underlying EPS measure for PSP and CIP awards made from 2017 will be adjusted to exclude the impact of any share buy backs.
The enhanced share element of the PSP awards has also been removed as it was not felt to be motivational: this is reflected in the reduction in the normal annual PSP award size from 200% of salary to 180% of salary in 2017 for the Executive Directors.
The PSP and CIP awards for 2017 will be granted with the following weightings and targets: 2017 PSP CIP Three year EPS growth p. a.
60% weighting Vesting % Three year average ROCE 40% weighting Vesting % Less than 4% 0% Less than 22% 0% 4% 25% 22% 25% 12% 100% 26% 100% Between 4% and 12% Straight line basis Between 22% and 26% Straight line basis Pension During the year, the Executive Directors received a cash supplement of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension contributions, and were eligible to join the Cash scheme.
For 2017, this arrangement remains unchanged.
On 31 December 2012, the Group closed the UK final salary pension plan to future accrual.
Under the scheme, the Group offered defined benefit pensions for the then Executive Directors and other senior executives at the normal retirement age of 65.
John McConnell was part of the scheme, Stefan Bomhard and Richard Howes are not.
