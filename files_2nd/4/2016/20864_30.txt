These form the basis of measurement, but are overlaid with an assessment of executive performance in the round in the relevant category.
The assessment for 2016 took place against a backdrop of significant and successful restructuring and transformation, cost saving, production growth, efficiency improvements and improved stakeholder relationships.
The personal performance outcomes set out above, combined with maximum EPS achievement and the safety modifier of 0.5 %, have generated overall bonus outcomes of 87.5%, 84.7% and 87.1%.
When applied to the maximum bonus of 210% of salary, these performance outcomes translate into bonuses of 2,316,573, 1,430,383 and 1,441,239 for the chief executive, finance director and technical director respectively.
40% of the total bonus is payable in cash, with 60% deferred into Bonus Shares.
Two-thirds of the Bonus Shares will vest after three years, subject to continued employment: the remaining third will vest after five years.
