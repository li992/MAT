Therefore the Committee is not proposing changes to the current remuneration policy and there will be overview no policy vote at this years AGM.
For ease of reference an On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our extract from the approved policy has been included at the Remuneration Report for 2015 16, my first as the Chairman back of this report on pages 74 to 81. of the Remuneration Committee.

co. uk 24471.04 8 April 2016 11:49 AM Proof 2 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information Recommendation Each year the Committee reviews the level of performancerelated pay earned by the executive directors.
The Committee considers that the remuneration earned continues to be a fair reflection of NEXTs operating and financial performance and is aligned to shareholders experience over the past 3 years.
We believe that the simplicity and transparency of our remuneration arrangements and their consistent application have contributed positively to NEXTs strong management team continuing to deliver resilient performance.
We focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between annual and long term incentive elements and also between cash and share-based elements, with the aim of ensuring that remuneration drives the right behaviours and rewards the right outcomes.
We believe that weighting rewards towards the long term ensures proper shareholder alignment, which is illustrated by the significant proportion of directors performance-related pay derived from growth in NEXTs share price.
There are no proposed changes to the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the May 2014 AGM and accordingly this year there is only an advisory vote on the implementation of the policy.
The Committee believes that last years remuneration has been in line with both the approved policy and its spirit, therefore, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the report to you.

implementation of remuneration policy in 2015 16 The Committee has operated the remuneration policy in accordance with the policy approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014.
The table below sets out the way that the policy was implemented in 2015 16 and any significant changes in the way the policy will be implemented in 2016 17.
Element of remuneration Policy implemented during 2015 16 and changes in 2016 17 Salary Base salaries of Lord Wolfson, Michael Law and Jane Shields increased by 2% in February 2016, in line with the wider company award.
For details about Amanda James base salary increase, please refer to page 53.
The Base salaries for the executive directors from February 2016 are: 000 Lord Wolfson 766 Amanda James 360 Michael Law 412 Jane Shields 412 Annual bonus No change.
Annual bonus is calculated on pre-tax EPS and we ensure that the executive directors are not incentivised to recommend share buybacks in preference to special dividends, or vice versa.
This is achieved by making a notional adjustment to EPS for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
For the year to January 2016, performance targets were set requiring pre-tax EPS growth on the prior year, adjusted for special dividends and excluding exceptional gains, of 5% before any bonus became payable being pre-tax EPS of 554p.
Maximum bonus of 100% and 150% of salary for the executive directors and Chief Executive respectively was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded growth of 15% being pre-tax EPS of 607p.
These targets were on a 52 week basis rd to avoid distortion from the 53 week in the financial year ended 30 January 2016.
Pre-tax EPS growth achieved in the year, adjusted for special dividends, was 8.1%.
In accordance with the bonus formula, a bonus of 45% of the maximum was earned.
Had no adjustments for special dividends been made, pre-tax EPS growth would have been 5.2%.
To the extent that the Chief Executives bonus exceeds 100% of salary, any excess is payable in shares, deferred for a period of two years and subject to forfeiture if he voluntarily resigns prior to the end of that period.
Bonus performance targets for the year ahead have been set but are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
The targets and performance will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.

For LTIP awards, the date in this column is the end of the three year performance period.
Actual vesting will be the date on which the Committee determines whether any Performance Conditions have been satisfied, or shortly thereafter.
For LTIP awards granted prior to February 2014 the maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a particular year is capped at 2.5m.
The cap was applied to the awards that vested in the year to January 2015 for Lord Wolfson.
The impact of this cap was to reduce the shares vested by 21,475.
See page 61 for details of the performance conditions and vesting levels applicable to the LTIP schemes with performance periods ending in the year.
The LTIP price at award date is NEXTs average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.
David Keens was a good leaver under the terms of the LTIP, SMP and Sharesave scheme rules and his entitlement to awards under these schemes has been reduced, time pro-rated proportionately to his actual period of service.
The vesting of Lord Wolfsons September 2012-2015 LTIP was delayed until January 2016, pending the outcome of the Committees decision regarding the funding of an increase to store staff entry level wages see page 54 for further details.
The quantum and value of this LTIP was the same as it would have been had it vested on the same date as used for other LTIP participants with second half 2012 LTIP awards.
Within the above table, all awards are subject to performance conditions except for Sharesave options and Deferred Bonus Shares.
From 2014 onwards, LTIP awards granted to executive directors which vest must be taken in shares and the net shares after payment of tax and NIC must be held for a minimum period of two further years.

Following the merger of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail in August 2014, Poundland Group was added to the comparator group for the performance period commencing in August 2014.
For the LTIP grants prior to that time, Carphone Warehouse and Dixons will continue as two entries with their relative TSRs being measured on pre independent and post identical merger performance over each performance period.
For preceding performance periods, when compared to the comparator group above, the additional changes are: 1. for the periods commencing August 2014, February 2014 and August 2013 no change: 2. for the periods commencing February 2013, August 2012 and February 2012 Kesa added and JD Sports removed.
Smp legacy only Vesting of awards is dependent solely on achieving the underlying fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below.
Under the formulae, a notional adjustment is made to actual EPS achieved for special dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.

The effective matching ratio will be calculated on a straight line basis for EPS falling between each of the threshold points.
The same EPS growth performance targets and matching ratios were also set for the May 2014 and April 2015 SMPs which were not granted to executive directors although those executives who subsequently joined the Board retain awards granted prior to their joining the Board.
