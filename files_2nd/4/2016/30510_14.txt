The Committee will report any adjustments in subsequent Remuneration Reports.
2016 LTIP Following the remuneration review in 2015, the Committee decided to cease granting separate CIP awards so the LTIP will be the only ongoing long-term incentive plan.
A new LTIP was therefore introduced at the 2016 AGM and the first LTIP awards are likely to be granted in October 2016.
The new LTIP is similar to the legacy LTIP except that, consistent with market practice, awards accrue the benefit of dividends and will be subject to a two year holding period which will apply to 50 per cent of the vested award.
From 2018, it is intended that the holding period will apply to the full vested award.
The 2016 awards will be based 60 per cent on EPS and 40 per cent on TSR.
The number of shares vesting for threshold performance will be reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent.
The Company will no longer use the dividend growth measure.

Base salaries are benchmarked against both FTSE 250 companies and other leading retailers.
While the Committee applies judgement rather than setting salaries by reference to a fixed percentile position, its general approach is to constrain base salaries to a median or lower level.
While the Committees general approach is to keep salaries to a relatively low level, and, in the normal course, would not expect salary increases to be higher than the average for other head office staff, given the need for a formal cap, the Committee has limited the maximum salary which it may award to 110 per cent of the median of salaries of CEOs in the top half of FTSE 250 companies even though, in practice, the Committee would normally seek to keep it below the median of this benchmark.
