Long term incentive awards Performance conditions Set out below is a summary of the performance conditions that apply to both the long-term incentive awards which vest in 2016 and the outstanding PSP awards, including those granted in February 2015 and December 2015.
With effect from 1 October 2014, new PSP awards were granted at 175% of base salary: no further awards have been made under the SMP and the final SMP awards vested in November 2016.
The performance conditions applying to new awards made under the PSP have been revised from those set out below for existing awards granted in 2013, as set out below.
aspx 56 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Remuneration Committee Report continued Annual Report on Remuneration The first performance condition for the PSP awards is that the average annual compound growth in the Companys adjusted EPS, over the three consecutive financial years following the financial year immediately prior to the grant, must exceed the annual compound growth rate in the UK Retail Price Index RPI by a specified amount over the same period.
For the new awards, the adjusted EPS targets will be specified as absolute figures, not relative to RPI.
The performance conditions are as follows: % of new Percentage of existing awards awards vesting vesting Existing awards December 2013 New awards from October 2014 Adjusted EPS growth over three years PSP SMP Adjusted EPS growth over three years PSP RPI 15% p. a. or above 100 100 RPI 12% p. a.

For the purposes of this condition, EPS is adjusted EPS as defined in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and this definition remains consistent with the definition of adjusted EPS approved by the Committee in previous years.
The second performance condition compares the growth of the Companys TSR over a three-year period to that of the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.

The remuneration of the Executive Director is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to exercise the options to acquire the shares and the total value of the shares on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil cost options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time up to the day preceding the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the underlying share price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise of the option.
This increase or decrease in value reflects an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The nil cost options outstanding at 30 September 2016 and the movements during the year are as follows: Options Options Vested unexercised Year of as at Exercised during the as at Exercise Earliest normal 5 vesting 1 Oct 2015 in year year 30 Sep 2016 price exercise date Expiry date Bruce Thompson 2015 40,579 40,579 1 Nov 2015 Dec 2022 2016 53,436 53,436 1 Nov 2016 Dec 2023 Nigel Lingwood 2015 26,311 26,311 1 Nov 2015 Dec 2022 2016 34,599 34,599 1 Nov 2016 Dec 2023 Iain Henderson 2015 25,299 25,299 1 Nov 2015 March 2017 2016 49,362 49,362 1 Nov 2016 March 2017 1 Bruce Thompson exercised 40,579 options on 11 December 2015, at a market price of 740.5p per share and the total proceeds before tax were 300,487.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 61 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Shareholding guidelines The Committee has adopted guidelines for Executive Directors, to encourage substantial long term share ownership.
These specify that, over a period of five years from the date of appointment, the Chief Executive Officer should build up and then retain a holding of shares with a value equivalent to 200% of base salary.
The guideline holding for the Group Finance Director is 100% of base salary.
