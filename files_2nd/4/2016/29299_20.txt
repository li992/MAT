The Committee reviewed performance and determined that the targets were achieved in full, and 10% of bonus out of a maximum of 10% was payable.
Overall bonus outcomes Based on performance in respect of both the financial and non-financial elements, an overall outcome of 25% out of a maximum of 100% was warranted.
Mr S. R. Mitchell stepped down from the Board on 11 November 2016, and will not receive a bonus payment in respect of 2016.
Mr D. G. Robertson retired from the Board in January 2017 and was eligible to receive a bonus in respect of 2016, subject to performance as determined and approved in the normal manner.
Therefore, he will receive a bonus of 25% of salary for 2016.
Two-thirds will be paid in cash in March 2017, and one-third will be deferred into shares, vesting in March 2020.
Mr M. Ewell did not participate in the 2016 annual bonus plan.
As in previous years, bonus payments are subject to clawback ie forfeiture or reduction in exceptional circumstances.
Long-Term Incentive Plan: 2014 awards On 18 September 2014, Mr S. R. Mitchell and Mr D. G. Robertson received awards of 466,628 and 280,817 nil-cost options respectively, under the 2014 LTIP.
Vesting of the award was dependent on three-year average ROCE, defined as underlying operating profit after tax divided by average net assets plus average net debt two-thirds of the award, and three-year cumulative underlying EPS performance onethird.
There was no re-testing of performance.
The performance targets are illustrated below: ROCE element of the award 2 3rd EPS element of the award 1 3rd 100% 100% 25% 0% 0% 9.2% 13% 35p 45p Average ROCE 20142016 Cumulative underlying EPS 20142016 operating profit after tax divided by the sum of total pence equity plus net debt For the ROCE element, if three-year average ROCE over the three financial years ending 31 December 2016 is less than or equal to 9.2%, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for ROCE of 13% or higher and vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points.
For the EPS element, if cumulative underlying EPS over the three financial years ending 31 December 2016 is less than 35p, no shares will vest.
25% of the award will vest for EPS of 35p and the award will vest in full for cumulative EPS of 45p or higher: vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points.

The minimum entry level for cumulative underlying EPS was not met.
The minimum entry level for three-year average ROCE was achieved, however as detailed on page 68 the Committee has determined this was only as a result of the significant impairment losses associated with businesses identified as non-core in 2016, and has exercised its judgment that the ROCE performance target has not been met and therefore resulted in a nil vesting.
The awards will therefore lapse on 18 September 2017.
Long-Term Incentive Plan: 2016 awards No LTIP awards were granted in 2016.

Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting local market conditions, the Committee believes that using the SLT as a subset for purposes of comparing Chief Executive pay against wider employee pay provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.
