DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 January 2016, which sets out the Directors Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and became effective for three years from the close of that meeting.
For ease of reference, we are including the Policy in this years Directors Remuneration Report.
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details of the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 30 January 2016 and how the Policy will be operated for the year commencing 31 January 2016.
I am delighted to report on the strong level of support received from shareholders, as evidenced by the voting outcome at the 2015 AGM.
The resolution seeking approval of the Annual Report on Remuneration was supported by over 99.9% of the votes cast.
During the year ended 25 January 2015, the Company appointed the Groups new Finance Director, Stuart Lorimer.
As noted in last years Directors Remuneration Report, in order to fully integrate Stuart within the business and align his interests with those of his peers, the Remuneration Committee brought him into the existing LTIP awards, although scaled back to reflect his reduced period of employment over the performance periods.
Details of the awards are set out on page 66.
John Nicolson was appointed Chairman of the Group on 1 January 2015.
At the request of the Board, he agreed to continue to chair the Remuneration Committee until the recruitment of a new independent non-executive director with the capability to replace him in this capacity could be completed.
In this regard, I joined the Board on 1 April 2015 and replaced John as chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 July 2015.
I would like to thank John for chairing the Remuneration Committee until the end of June 2015.
2015 16 KEY DECISIONS AND PAY OUTCOMES As described in the Strategic Report, against challenging soft drinks market conditions, the Group delivered revenue for the year ended 30 January 2016 of 258.6m, a decrease of 0.9% on the prior year.
The UK soft drinks market decreased by 1.8% in value over the same period of time.
Pre-tax profit decreased by 1.4% on the prior year.
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a responsible approach to executive pay and believes that variable pay should only be earned for achievement against stretching targets.
Despite a number of year on year improvements, the threshold profit target was not met, and therefore no annual bonus awards have been paid to R. A.
White, S. Lorimer, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott in respect of the year ended 30 January 2016.
Average EPS growth for the three years ended 30 January 2016 exceeded the average EPS for the three years preceding that period both being adjusted for Retail Price Index by 15.0%.
As a result, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards granted in April 2013 vested at 37.89%.
Further details in relation to the annual 61 bonus and LTIP vesting are included on pages 63 to 65.
PROPOSED CHANGES IN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION FOR 2016 17 The Remuneration Committee has continued to monitor executive remuneration policy to take account of evolving market practice and its alignment with the strategic direction of the business as set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 45, whilst also seeking to ensure that there is continuity to the structure of executive pay.
In line with the range of salary increases across the Group, an increase of 2.0% will be made to the executive directors base salaries with effect from 1 April 2016.
An increase of 2.0% will also be made to the Chairmans fee and the other non-executive directors basic fee with effect from 1 April 2016.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the EPS targets under the LTIP during the year to ensure that they continue to provide an appropriate balance between motivating and rewarding executive directors to deliver stretching but sustainable performance in line with business strategy, without encouraging excessive risk taking.
Following consultation with key shareholders, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it would set absolute EPS targets on a cumulative basis for LTIP awards granted in 2016 and thereafter.
The Remuneration Committee considers that this approach will result in the setting of more meaningful EPS targets annually.
The 2016 LTIP awards will continue to be based on EPS performance only, with the view of considering other performance metrics alongside EPS in the future.
Further details in relation to the EPS targets are included on page 66.
In line with best practice, and reflecting the UK Corporate Governance Code, a clawback provision has been introduced to annual bonus awards earned for the year ending 28 January 2017 and future years and for LTIP awards granted during 2016 and future years.
The clawback provisions will enable the Remuneration Committee to recover payments made for up to two years following the determination of the annual bonus pay-out or vesting outcome of LTIP awards, in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups financial results or if the participant has been guilty of misconduct.
The clawback provisions are in addition to the malus provisions that currently apply to annual bonus and LTIP awards.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys website, www.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDING AND SHARE INTERESTS AUDITED INFORMATION In order to further align the executive directors long term interests with those of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee introduced new share ownership guidelines applicable from 2017 18.
The guidelines require that, with effect from 2017 18, when the first awards granted under the 2014 LTIP are due to vest, executive directors retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans and retain up to half of any bonus pay-out after tax to purchase shares in the Company until the value of their shareholding is equal to 125% of gross basic salary.
Until this shareholding is acquired, the executive directors may not, without Remuneration Committee approval, sell shares other than to finance any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of LTIP awards.
Prior to 2017 18, executive directors are required to retain all shares acquired under Company sponsored share plans until the value of their shareholding is equal to 100% of gross basic salary.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott met the 100% of gross basic salary requirement applicable for the year ended 30 January 2016.

a level that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and expertise.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Fees are set at a level which reflects the skill, knowledge and experience of the individual, whilst taking into account appropriate market data.
The Board is responsible for setting the fees of the other nonexecutive directors.
Fees may include a basic fee and additional fees for further responsibilities for example, chairmanship of board committees.
Fees are set taking into account several factors, including the size and complexity of the business, appropriate market data and the expected time commitment and contribution for the role.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Companys share schemes or bonus schemes nor do they receive any pension contributions.
Non-executive directors may be eligible to receive benefits such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other benefits that may be appropriate.
Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Directors annual remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
EXPLANATION OF PERFORMANCE METRICS CHOSEN AND THE TARGET SETTING PROCESS 79 Performance measures are selected that are aligned to the Companys strategy.
Stretching performance targets are set each year for the annual bonus and long term incentive awards.
When setting these performance targets, the Remuneration Committee will take into account a number of different reference points, which may include the Companys business plans and strategy and the market environment.
Full vesting will only occur for what the Remuneration Committee considers to be stretching performance.
The annual bonus performance targets have been selected to provide an appropriate balance between incentivising directors to meet financial targets for the year and achieving strategic and or personal objectives.
The LTIP performance targets reflect the Companys strategic objectives and therefore the financial and strategic decisions which ultimately determine the success of the Company.
The LTIP performance measures will be based on financial measures, including but not exclusively Earnings Per Share growth, which is a key measure of the Companys profitability, and or comparative total shareholder return related measures.
The Remuneration Committee retains the ability to adjust or set different performance measures if events occur such as a change in strategy, a material acquisition and or a divestment of a Group business or a change in prevailing market conditions which cause the Remuneration Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
Awards and options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the scheme rules.
POLICY FOR THE REMUNERATION OF EMPLOYEES GENERALLY Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle that reward should be achieved for delivery of the business strategy and should be sufficient to attract and retain high calibre talent.
Under the rules of the ESOS and the 2014 LTIP, certain managers are eligible to participate in the ESOS and the 2014 LTIP: however there has been no such participation to date and there is no current intention to invite managers to do so.
Senior managers were not eligible to participate in the 2003 LTIP.
The annual bonus arrangements for the senior management team are similar to those for the executive directors in that targets are set annually dependent on financial and or non-financial performance metrics.
The key principles of the remuneration philosophy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of the seniority of employees.

100% of an 80 award vests where EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 32.5% or more.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the performance targets and measures where it considers it appropriate to do so.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION The policy aims to facilitate the appointment of individuals of sufficient calibre to lead the business and execute the strategy effectively for the benefit of shareholders.
When appointing a new director, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the Company and in line with market practice.
The Remuneration Committee will take into consideration a number of relevant factors, which may include the calibre of the individual, the candidates existing remuneration package, and the specific circumstances of the individual including the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited.
The Remuneration Committee will typically seek to align the remuneration package with the Companys remuneration policy as set out in the policy table.
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be granted excluding buy-out awards referred to below is 300% of salary in line with this policy.
Subject to this overall maximum variable remuneration, incentive awards will only be granted above the normal maximum annual award opportunities where the Remuneration Committee considers there to be a commercial rationale, which may include but is not limited to circumstances where an executive director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance.
The quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that any such awards are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance targets and will be forfeited if performance or continued employment conditions are not achieved.
The individual will usually move over time onto a remuneration package that is consistent with the normal maximum annual award opportunities set out in the policy table.
A. G. BARR P. L. C. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to include other remuneration components or awards which are outside the specific terms of the policy but subject to the limit on variable remuneration to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an appropriate calibre, where the Remuneration Committee believes there is a need to do so in the best interests of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee would ensure that awards within the 300% of salary variable remuneration limit are linked to the achievement of appropriate and challenging performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee does not intend to use this discretion to make a non-performance related incentive payment for example a golden hello.
In some circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make payments or awards to recognise or buy-out remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The Remuneration Committee will normally aim to do so broadly on a like-for-like basis taking into account a number of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may include the form of award, any performance conditions attached to the awards and the time at which they would have vested.
These payments or awards are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to above, however the Remuneration Committees intention is that the value awarded would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
Any share awards referred to in this section will be granted as far as possible under the Companys existing share plans.
If necessary, and subject to the limits referred to above, recruitment awards may be granted outside of these plans as currently permitted under the Listing Rules which allow for the grant of awards to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the recruitment of an executive director.
Where a position is fulfilled internally, any ongoing remuneration obligations or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to the original terms.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or non-executive director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.

LTIP awards are included in the scenarios above at face value with no share price movement included.
SERVICE CONTRACTS Executive directors contracts are on a rolling basis and may be terminated on 12 months notice by the Company or on 6 months notice by the executive.
Service contracts for new directors will generally be limited to 12 months notice by the Company.
The service contracts for R. A.
White, J. D. Kemp and A. L. Memmott provide for a notice period of 12 months except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company reconstruction.
Under these conditions and certain circumstances these directors are entitled to a liquidated damages payment equal to the directors basic salary at termination plus the value of all contractual benefits for a two year period.
In the event this liquidated damages payment is triggered, the director will also be deemed to be a good leaver for the purposes of the Companys share schemes.
Given the size of the Company and the sector dynamics at the time these directors were recruited, the Remuneration Committee considered this provision appropriate in order to attract and retain high calibre executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee is cognisant of the fact that these provisions do not reflect best practice.
It has therefore 82 considered the alternatives available to exit these contractual arrangements, including contractual buy-out.
However, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it was not feasible to place a value on these rights, in order to remove them from the contracts, which would be acceptable to both parties.
It therefore determined that the most appropriate approach would be to maintain the legacy provisions, however for all future appointments these provisions would not apply.
The service contract for S. Lorimer does not contain these provisions.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders in accordance with the Code.
Their appointments are terminable by either the Company or the directors themselves upon three months notice without compensation.
A. G. BARR P. L. C. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE The principles on which the determination of payments for loss of office will be approached are set out below: Policy Payment in lieu of notice Payments to executive directors upon termination of their service contracts will be equal to 12 months base salary or the highest annual rate earned by the executive during the preceding three years, whichever is higher plus benefits in kind and pension contributions at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonus This will be at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an individual basis and the decision as to whether or not to award a bonus in full or in part will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the circumstances of the individuals departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question.
Any bonus amounts paid will typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will, subject to performance, be paid at the usual time.
2014 LTIP The extent to which any award under the 2014 LTIP will vest would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the 2014 LTIP rules.
The Remuneration Committee shall determine when awards vest in accordance with those provisions.
Awards will normally lapse if the participant leaves employment before vesting.
However, awards may vest in good leaver circumstances, including death, disability, ill-health, injury, sale of the participants employer, or any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Any good leaver awards will vest at the date of cessation of employment unless the Remuneration Committee decides they should vest at the normal vesting date.
In either case, the extent to which an award vests will be determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed from the date of grant to the date of cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee may vest the award on any other basis if it believes there are exceptional circumstances which warrant that.
Options are exercisable for six months from leaving employment or six months from the normal vesting date as appropriate.
83 Change of control Awards under the 2014 LTIP will generally vest early on a takeover, merger or other corporate reorganisation.
The Remuneration Committee will determine the level of vesting taking account of performance conditions and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, pro-rating for time, where applicable.
Alternatively, participants may be allowed or required to exchange their awards for awards over shares in the acquiring company.
Awards under all employee share schemes will be expected to vest on a change of control and those which have to meet specific requirements to benefit from permitted tax benefits will vest in accordance with those requirements.
Mitigation The executive directors service contracts do not provide for any reduction in payments for mitigation or for early payment.
Other payments Payments may be made under the Companys all employee share plans which are governed by HMRC tax-approved plan rules and which cover certain leaver provisions.
There is no discretionary treatment of leavers under these plans.
In appropriate circumstances, payments may also be made in respect of accrued holiday, outplacement and legal fees.
Where a buy-out award is made under the Listing Rules then the leaver provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a directors office or employment.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing executive director, as well as the interests of the remaining directors.
Where the Remuneration Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide flexibility in certain situations, taking into account the particular circumstances of the directors departure and performance.
A. G. BARR P. L. C. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY The Remuneration Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company when considering the executive directors remuneration.
When considering base salary increases, the Remuneration Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to other employees.
Employees are not actively consulted on directors remuneration.
The Company has regular contact with union bodies on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements.
EXISTING CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside the policy in this report: where the terms of the payment were agreed before the policy came into effect: where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the Company: or to satisfy contractual commitments under legacy remuneration arrangements.
For these purposes, the term payments includes the satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Remuneration Committees discretion includes discretion to determine matters in accordance with the rules of the 2003 LTIP, including the extent to which awards under that plan may vest on the fulfilment of performance conditions, in the event of the voluntary winding up of the Company, on a change of control, on the death of a participant, and in good leaver circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee may make minor changes to this policy which do not have a material advantage to directors, to aid in its operation or implementation, taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Remuneration Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and welcomes feedback on executive and nonexecutive directors remuneration.
