There is currently no intention to grant awards at this level.
Awards in 2017 will be made to the Executive Directors with a value of 225% of salary.
Threshold vesting for all targets is 20% with vesting between threshold and maximum 100% on a straight-line basis.

Remuneration policy application in 2016 The following section provides details of how the current Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2016.
Executive Directors The table below sets out in a single figure the total remuneration for both Executive Directors for the financial year.
In the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts part of the amount shown was the indicative vesting value of the 2013 PSP awards that were subject to performance conditions measured to 31 December 2015.
The figures shown in the table above represent the subsequent value received on the vesting date of 29 March 2016 using the share price on that day 240.98 pence, a total decrease of 141,625.
The amount shown is the indicative value of the 2014 LTIP awards that were subject to performance conditions measured to 31 December 2016.
The value was calculated using the average share price for the final quarter of 2016 178 pence.
50% of these shares are subject to a one year holding period.
The aggregate emoluments for all directors as required under Schedule 5 SI 2008 410 is the total remuneration shown in the table above less share awards, plus the total emolument figures for Non-executive Directors shown on page 83, 3,908k.
Further information in relation to each of the elements of remuneration for 2016 set out in the table above is detailed below.
An explanation for 2015 is set out in detail in our 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, which can be found on our website.
com investors 80 Governance ITV plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Salary Executive Directors base salaries were increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 January 2016 in line with those of the wider employee population.
Taxable benefits The benefits provided to the Executive Directors include the cost of private medical insurance and car-related benefits.
Bonus cash and shares Annual incentives are provided to Executive Directors through the bonus, with one-third of any award deferred into shares under the Deferred Share Award Plan DSA.
The performance conditions that apply to the bonus are set on an individual basis and are linked to the Companys corporate, financial and strategic priorities.
This enables the Committee to reward both annual financial performance delivered for shareholders, and performance against specific financial, operational or strategic objectives set for each Executive Director, which are closely linked to the strategic priorities of the business.
As stated in last years report, the weighting on personal performance was reduced for 2016 from 40% to 25% of the total bonus opportunity.
Payments and deferrals in respect of the financial year are set out below.
% of maximum Value deferred bonus into shares Value paid opportunity under the DSA in cash Total value earned Adam Crozier 40% 225,828 451,656 677,484 Ian Griffiths 40% 126,506 253,011 379,517 Percentage of maximum bonus opportunity earned for 2015 was 96% and 95% for Adam Crozier and Ian Griffiths respectively.
When considering performance outcomes, the Committee looks to ensure the outcomes align with overall business performance.
The majority of the bonus 75% was based upon the achievement of corporate and financial targets, with payout determined in accordance with pre-set target ranges subject only to the usual adjustments to exclude the impact of material in-year acquisitions and disposals, significant unbudgeted initiatives and currency movements.
The remainder of the bonus 25% was based upon the Committees assessment of the contribution each Executive Director has made to the overall strategy through the delivery of specific targets.
Both Executive Directors had a number of common objectives aligned to our Strategic Priorities.
The Strategic Report sets out more detail of the Companys achievements in the year.
In a year which brought the EU referendum result, the subsequent market uncertainty and a 3% decline in NAR the Executive Directors responded swiftly and robustly to the resulting business impact.
They instigated prompt cost savings and provided strong leadership which has resulted in a record adjusted profit for the Company.
The Executive Directors delivered well on their original objectives and also on some new ones developed in response to the changed market conditions: Adam Crozier oversaw a refreshed broadcasting strategy, resulting in SOV growth both for the Companys main and family of channels.
There was once again strong growth in ITVs Online, Pay and Interactive businesses.
The Groups global business was driven forward, with vertical integration of value from the Talpa acquisition and the announcement of BritBox in the USA.
Ian Griffiths supported ITV Studios and ITV Broadcast to develop their international businesses and creative performance and secured agreement to ITVs London property strategy.
In the circumstances and noting that all of these targets were fully achieved along with full delivery of other personal measures, the Committee agreed that a 100% pay out against personal measures was appropriate as explained in the Chairmans letter on page 75.
The Committee also confirms that, where relevant, it also considered environmental, social and governance factors in considering the overall outcome.
81 Governance Annual Report on Remuneration Annual Report on Remuneration continued In order to reflect best practice, the Committee has provided disclosure of the corporate and financial targets used for 2016, together with performance against those targets and the resulting level of payout as set out below.

Up to 20% is payable for threshold and up to 60% for target performance.
Share awards We are required to show share awards in the remuneration table on page 80 according to the year in which the performance period for each performance condition came to an end.
100% of the awards made in 2014 under the LTIP were subject to performance conditions measured to 31 December 2016.

The share price used to value the shares at 31 December 2016 is the average share price for the final quarter of 2016 178 pence.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares under award was 183.5 pence the average of the share price on each of the 27, 28 and 29 May 2014.
When considering performance outcomes the Committee looks beyond formulaic results to ensure the outcomes align with overall business performance.
In the circumstances, the formulae were applied without adjustment.

The Committee sets targets for the LTIP taking into account external forecasts, internal budgets, business priorities, and risks and uncertainties.
Targets are set to be appropriately stretching in this context, with maximum performance set at a level which is considered to be the delivery of exceptional performance.
The awards made in 2016 are subject to performance measures and targets as set out below.

50% of the requirement must normally be obtained within three years of appointment and the remainder normally within five years.
% of salary % of salary required under held at shareholding 31 December guidelines 2016 Adam Crozier 400 446 Ian Griffiths 200 473 The share price used to value the shares as at 30 December 2016 was 206 pence.
The shares included in the calculation are shares held in the individuals own name and the net of tax shares held under the 2014 DSA which are not contingent on continued employment awards made from 2015 are contingent on continued employment and will not form a part of the requirement.
Where the value of shares required to be held increases as a result of a salary increase or an increase in the relevant percentage, the Executive Directors will have three years from such increase to achieve compliance.
The Committee may change the guidelines so long as they are not, overall, in the view of the Committee, less onerous.
Non-executive directors are currently required to use 25% of their annual fees, after statutory deductions, to acquire shares in the Company.
The shares are purchased quarterly and held until they retire from the Board.
From 2017 it is proposed that this will change so that unless they are unable to retain their fees they are all required to build and then maintain a holding of 100% of their base fee over the six years from the date of appointment to the Board.
