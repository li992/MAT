Non-financial KPIs may also be included in the scorecard, but non-financial performance has a lower weighting than financial performance.
For each KPI, there is a threshold, target and stretch i. e. excellent performance level: the maximum annual variable pay is paid for stretch performance.
Executive Directors can choose to sacrifice part of their bonus into theGroups defined contribution pension scheme.
The Company will contribute 13.8% of the amount sacrificed into the employees pension, which is equal to the amount of employers national insurance that would have been due had the amount been paid as salary: this is cost neutral to the Company.
In common with all other employees of the Group, a significant proportion of variable pay is compulsorily deferred under the Deferred Profit Share Plan DPSP into Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC BDH Ordinary Shares or nil-priced options over shares, which vest in one tranche, normally after three years.

The Committee determines the requirement and reviews this periodically.
The current limits are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account The Remuneration Committee regularly compares the Policy with shareholder guidelines and takes account of the results of shareholder votes on remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee Chairman will consult with major investors ahead of any material changes to the Policy, and along with the Company Secretary, is available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any of the policy related disclosures or outcomes contained in this Directors' Remuneration Report.
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last years Remuneration Report are provided on page 93. brewin.
co. uk 79 Directors Remuneration Report continued Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group A consistent remuneration philosophy for employees is applied at all levels and the aggregate rate of base salary increase for allemployees is one of the factors considered when determining increases in fixed pay for Directors.
All employees are eligible for discretionary performance-related annual bonus and the principle of bonus deferral applies to annual bonuses for employees whose bonuses exceed certain thresholds.
A formal employee consultation on remuneration is not operated: however, employees are able to provide direct feedback on the Groups remuneration policies to their managers or the Human Resources department and as part of an annual employee engagement survey.
The Group HumanResources Director is a standing attendee at Remuneration Committee meetings and presents regular reports on people strategy, including the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration policies and how they are viewed by employees.
Fixed ratios between the total remuneration levels of different roles in the Group are not applied, as this would prevent us from recruitingand retaining the necessary talent in a highly competitive employment market.
Benchmarking The Remuneration Committee takes account of market benchmark data when setting total remuneration packages for Executive Directors and comparisons are made with other FTSE listed companies of similar size and business profile to the Group.
Practices inthe wealth management sector and other related sectors are also considered.
Benchmark data are used as a reference point, alongside other factors such as the individuals role, experience andperformance, rather than as a direct determinant of pay levels.
Differences in remuneration policy for Executive Directors compared to other employees The approach to remuneration for the Executive Directors is generally consistent with that for employees across the Group as a whole.
However, there are some differences which the Remuneration Committee believes are necessary to reflect the different responsibilities of employees across the Group, and the need to recruit, retain and motivate employees in a variety of roles.
For example, below Executive Director level, the portion of annual variable pay that is deferred is structured differently and is capped at one-third rather thanthe two-thirds deferral that applies to Executive Directors.
Awards of market purchased shares are made to selected individuals from time to time, excluding Executive Directors, which vest subject to continued service, to recognise individuals value to the Group and to create further alignment with shareholders.
External non-executive director positions Executive Directors are permitted to serve as non-executive directors of other companies, on the grounds that this can help to broaden the skills and experience of the Director, provided there is no competition with the Groups business activities and where these duties do not interfere with the individuals ability to perform his duties for the Group.
The number of external directorships an Executive Director can hold is limited to two non-executive directorships.
Where an outside appointment is accepted in furtherance of the Groups business, any fees received are remitted to the Group.
If the appointment is not connected to the Groups business, the Executive Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
80 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Approach to remuneration for new Executive Director appointments The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms and maximum levels of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The Committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders, for the purpose of replacing awards or potential foreseeable earnings which are forgone by the individual on becoming an Executive Director.
This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.
In considering any such payments the Remuneration Committee would take account of the amount of remuneration forgone and the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to the remuneration forgone.
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments and the rationale for these.
For an internal appointment, any deferred pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment.
In addition, ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may be permitted to continue where this is considered to be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.
For external and internal appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate.
Service contracts and loss of office payments Service contracts normally continue until the Executive Directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
In summary, the contractual provisions are: Provision Detailed terms Notice period Six months Termination payment in Total Fixed Pay in respect of the unexpired period of contractual notice, in addition to any amounts to the event of termination by which they are statutorily entitled.
In certain cases, the Committee may also consider a discretionary the Company without due award of annual variable pay, subject to performance, in respect of the portion of any financial year that notice the individual has been working with the Group, although not for the period of any payment in lieu of notice or garden leave.
Change of control Same terms as above on termination.
The Group has power to enter into settlement agreements with executives and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims.
Any outstanding share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the Groups LTIP or other share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, redundancy, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure, good leaver status can be applied.
In such cases, the normal practice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, is for any LTIP awards held to be pro-rated for the period of the performance period that has expired, and the performance conditions would continue to apply.
Share awards under the Deferred Profit Share Plan DPSP will vest in full on the original vesting schedule.
An Executive Directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
co. uk 81 Directors Remuneration Report continued Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors Remuneration Policy includes authority for the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports.
Details of any payments to former Directors will be set out in the implementation section of this report as they arise.

co. uk 85 Directors Remuneration Report continued Base salary review Audited The Executive Directors salaries were reviewed during 2016 and shareholders were consulted on a proposal to re-position David Nicoland Andrew Westenbergers salaries to a competitive level in line with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Executive Directors base salaries have not been increased since their appointment in 2013 and their pay had been positioned conservatively at that time.
Indetermining an appropriate level of increase, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account the performance and experience of the individuals, the market rate for the roles by reference to other companies of a similar size and complexity and the impact of the salary increase on other elements of the remuneration package.
The salary increases are also intended to assist with retention, and in recognition that should new incumbents to executive director roles need to be recruited in the future, a significantly higher salary than those previously paid would be needed to attract strong candidates.
The shareholders consulted on this proposal were supportive and the base salaries of the Executive Directors were increased as set out below.
The increase was effective on 1 June 2016 following the conclusion of the shareholder consultation as the Committee did not consider it appropriate to apply the increase retrospectively to 1 January 2016.
