Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors compared to other employees There are differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors and employees, which are necessary to reflect the different levels of responsibility and market practices.
The key difference is the increased emphasis on performancerelated pay in senior roles.
Lower maximum incentive pay opportunities apply below executive level, driven by market benchmarks and the relative impact of the role.
Only the most senior executives in the Group participate in the LTIP and the BSP as these plans are targeted on those individuals who have the greatest responsibility for Group performance.
Executive directors existing service contracts, and policy on loss of office The service contracts for David Hathorn and Andrew King provide for one years notice by either party.
They include pay in lieu of notice provisions which may be invoked at the discretion of the Group.
The payment in lieu of notice would comprise base salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice period and an amount in compensation for annual bonus only for that part of the financial year the individual has worked.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2016 115 Peter Oswald was recruited, and is based, in Austria.
His service contract is required under Austrian law to be for a fixed period, which renewable fixed period expires on 30 April 2019.
However, the contract has also been structured as far as possible to conform to the accepted practice for directors in the UK, and can be terminated on one years notice by either party.
Prior to 2008, he did not have a notice period, and was entitled to receive compensation on termination equivalent to remuneration for the unexpired term of the fiveyear fixed term contract.
The committee re-negotiated this contract in 2008 to substantially reduce the Groups potential liabilities, and introduced a standard 12-month notice period, together with an accompanying lump sum payment on termination, which was necessary to facilitate the transition from the previous contract.
In the event of termination by Mondi, other than for cause, the current contract provides for payment of base salary, benefits and pension contribution in respect of the 12-month notice period and eligibility for annual bonus in respect of the period he has worked.
He would also be eligible for a lump sum amount calculated as 908,800 plus interest on this amount accrued at the Euribor interest rate for the period since 1 January 2008.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the Groups share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules.
The default treatment is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the committee taking into account the individuals performance and the reasons for their departure good Ieaver status can be applied.
For good leavers, vesting of BSP awards that are not subject to performance conditions is accelerated to as soon as practical after employment termination.
LTIP awards remain subject to performance conditions measured over the original time period and are reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served.
The committee has the discretion to disapply the application of performance conditions and or time pro-rating if it considers it appropriate to do so.
However, it is envisaged that this would only be applied in exceptional circumstances.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good Ieaver or not, the committee will take into account the performance of the individual and the reasons for their departure.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors who served during the period under review are as follows.
These contracts were all signed prior to 27 June 2012.
Executive director Effective date of contract Unexpired term notice period David Hathorn 3 July 2007 Terminable on 12 months notice Andrew King 23 October 2008 Terminable on 12 months notice Peter Oswald 1 January 2008 A fixed term expiring on 30 April 2019 but terminable at any time on 12 months notice A directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
Service contracts for new appointments Normally, for any new executive director appointments, the Groups policy is that the service contracts should provide for one years notice by either party.
The contract would provide that, in the event of termination by the company, other than for cause, the executive would be eligible for: e payment of the base salary, pension contribution and benefits in respect of the unexpired portion of the 12-month notice period: e annual bonus only in respect of the period they have served, payable following the relevant performance year-end and subject to the normal performance conditions for annual bonus: and e share-based awards they hold, subject to the plan rules, which include arrangements for pro-ration of LTIP awards and continued application of performance conditions.
The Group would seek to apply the principle of mitigation to the termination payment by, for example, making payments in instalments that can be reduced or ended if the former executive wishes to commence alternative employment during the payment period.
In exceptional circumstances, such as to secure for the Group the appointment of a highly talented and experienced executive in a market such as Germany or Austria where it is common for the most senior executives to have three-year or five-year fixed term contracts, the committee may need to offer a longer initial notice period that reduces progressively to one year over a set time period.
In such exceptional circumstances, the committee would seek to ensure that any special contract provisions are not more generous than is absolutely necessary to secure the appointment of such a highly talented individual.
The committee would also take account of the remuneration and contract features that the executive may be foregoing or relinquishing in order to join Mondi, in comparison with the overall remuneration package that Mondi is able to offer.
116 Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2016 Directors remuneration policy Approach to remuneration for new executive director appointments The remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Groups approved remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.
The variable remuneration for a new executive director would be determined in the same way as for existing executive directors, and would be subject to the maximum limits on variable pay referred to in the policy table onpages 112 and 113.
For an internal appointment, any legacy pay elements awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to their terms.
For internal and external appointments, the Group may meet certain relocation expenses, as appropriate.
For external appointments, the committee may also offer additional cash and or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of Mondi and shareholders, to replace variable remuneration awards or arrangements that an individual has foregone in order to join the Group.
This includes the use of awards made under section 9.4.
Any such payments would take account of the details of the remuneration foregone including the nature, vesting dates and any performance requirements attached to that remuneration.

Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2016 117 The Group may reimburse the reasonable expenses of board directors that relate to their duties on behalf of Mondi including tax thereon if applicable.
The Group may also provide advice and assistance with board directors tax returns where these are impacted by the duties they undertake on behalf of Mondi.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with Mondi Limited and Mondi plc for an initial period of three years.
In accordance with best practice, non-executive directors are subject to annual re-election at the Annual General Meetings.
Appointments may be terminated by Mondi with six months notice.
No compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Groups remuneration policy for the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives is set taking appropriate account of remuneration and employment conditions of other colleagues in the Group.
The committee annually receives a report from management on pay practices across the Group, including salary levels and trends, collective bargaining outcomes and bonus participation.
At the time that salary increases are considered the Committee additionally receives a report on the approach management proposes to adopt for general staff increases.
Both these reports are taken into account in the committees decisions about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives.
The Group does not engage in formal consultation with employees on directors remuneration policy.
However, employees of the Group are encouraged to provide feedback on the Groups general employment policies.
In some countries where the Group operates, more formal consultation arrangements with employee representatives are in place relating to employment terms and conditions, in accordance with local custom and practice.
The Group also conducts periodic employee engagement surveys which gauge employees satisfaction with their working conditions.
The Mondi Boards are given feedback on these survey results.
Shareholder context The committee considers the views of shareholders in its deliberations about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives, and consults directly with major shareholders when any material changes to policy are being considered.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this policy report, authority is given to the Group to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports.
Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the annual report on remuneration as they arise.

In the 2015 report we went substantially further in providing details of the performance against safety objectives that were set for the year under review.
In the case of executives personal objectives we described the achievements of our executives against key 2015 focus areas, together with the ratings awarded to each executive.
In the case of financial performance, we provided retrospective disclosure of the financial bonus ranges and outcomes for the year prior to the year under review.
We additionally provided outline disclosure of financial bonus outcomes for the year under review.
The retrospective approach was adopted for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
Few of Mondis competitors are subject to the same disclosure obligations as Mondi and disclosure of the detailed financial bonus ranges for the year under review would place Mondi at a competitive disadvantage.
For its 2016 report Mondi has therefore again adopted this approach to bonus disclosure.
2016 bonus outcomes For the annual bonus in respect of 2016 performance, the performance measures and achievement levels were: BSP performance measures EBITDA ROCE Safety Personal Total Weight 30 30 10 30 100 Outcomes: David Hathorn 18.1 16.6 10 24 68.7 Andrew King 18.1 16.6 10 25 69.7 Peter Oswald 18.1 16.6 10 25 69.7 Retrospective disclosure of 2015 financial bonus ranges Financial performance was assessed against the EBITDA and ROCE ranges that were set for 2015.
The 2015 ranges and outcomes were: Bonus outcome Bonus outcome EBITDA m points ROCE % points Entry level 985 7.5 13.9% 7.5 Target 1,159 18.75 16.4% 18.75 Ceiling 1,332 30.00 18.8% 30.00 Outcome 1,325 29.60 20.5% 30.00 Full disclosure of the 2016 bonus ranges and outcomes will be included in the 2017 report.
Safety element of 2016 bonus Five points of the 10-point safety element was payable on the achievement of total recordable case rate TRCR targets.
If the achieved TRCR rate was 0.75 or better, then the entire 5 points would be earned.
One point would be earned for a TRCR of 0.83, with straight-line interpolation for TRCR performance between 0.75 and 0.83.
The other 5 points were payable if there were no fatalities within the Mondi Group.
If there is one fatality then these 5 points are forfeited.
If there are two fatalities during the year then the entire 10 points attributable to safety are forfeited.
Mondi continued to achieve an industry-leading TRCR performance.
The TRCR that was achieved for 2016 was 0.66 and there were no fatalities of employees or contractors.
10 points attributable to this element were therefore earned.

The ratings of the three David Hathorn 24 30 executive directors were: Andrew King 25 30 Peter Oswald 25 30 Detail of annual bonus awarded in the year Name Awarded in cash Awarded in shares Total David Hathorn 573,095 573,095 1,146,190 Andrew King 275,720 275,720 551,440 Peter Oswald 392,690 392,690 785,380 Malus and clawback The committee considered whether there were any circumstances in the year that would have required clawback and agreed that such circumstances did not exist.
Under Mondis LTIP and BSP rules malus and clawback can be applied to awards made on or after 1 January 2011 if there has been a misstatement of financial results, or performance conditions that are relevant to the Plans, that had the effect that awards were larger than they would have been had such errors not been made.
Malus and clawback may at the committees discretion take the form of a demand for the participant to repay amounts to Mondi, a reduction of future bonus payments to the participant, and a reduction in the number of conditional share awards held by a participant.
Malus and clawback apply to misstatement of results or miscalculation of relevant performance conditions.
In the case of employment termination Mondi is able to cancel subsisting but unvested share awards, withhold payments that would otherwise be due to the participant, and where appropriate initiate legal proceedings to recover funds to which the Group is legally entitled.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2016 121 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Vesting of the 2014 awards The LTIP awards that were made in 2014, with a three-year performance period that ended on 31 December 2016, were reviewed by the committee in February 2017 against the equally weighted relative TSR and ROCE performance conditions.
Maximum performance was achieved against the ROCE target and 85% against the TSR target.
92.5% of the shares under award therefore vested in March 2017.
Awards granted in 2016 The maximum award that can be made to any LTIP participant in any year under the existing policy is equal to two times salary.
For 2016, the award made to David Hathorn was 185% of salary and the awards made to Andrew King and Peter Oswald were 150% of salary.
For the LTIP awards made in 2016, the performance conditions are based on two performance measures of equal weight relative TSR and ROCE measured over a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2018.
The committee believes that this combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders interests and the Groups business strategy.
The TSR performance condition is based on the Groups TSR relative to a group of competitor companies.
For the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards, the following companies were selected: 1 2 Amcor 2013 MeadWestvaco DSSmith Stora Enso 1 3 Bemis 2013 Holmen Mets Board The Navigator Company Billerud International Paper Sappi UPM 4 Domtar Mayr-Melnhof Smurfit Kappa West Rock 1 As previously reported, Amcor and Bemis were added to the peer group for 2013 and subsequent awards 2 MeadWestvaco was included in LTIP awards until its merger with Rock Tenn in 2015 when it was, in accordance with committee practice, removed from the peer group for all subsisting awards 3 Portucel Soporcel Group rebranded in February 2016 as The Navigator Company 4 WestRock, the company that was formed by the merger of MeadWestvaco and Rock Tenn, has been included in the peer group for 2016 and subsequent awards For the 50% of awards attributable to TSR: If the Groups TSR is below the median when ranked against the comparator group, this part of the award will lapse in full.
For TSR at the median, 25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest, with a straightline progression to the upper quartile, at which point 100% of this part of the award i. e. 50% of the total award will vest.
For the 50% of awards attributable to ROCE: This part will lapse in full if ROCE is below 10%.
25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest for achievement of ROCE of 10%, with a straight-line progression to full vesting of this part of the award for achievement of ROCE of 16% i. e. 50% of the total award.
For the 2017 and subsequent LTIP awards, the committee intends to expand the peer group to include Huhtamaki and RPC.
Mondis TSR performance over the last eight years The following graphs set out the comparative TSR of Mondi Limited relative to the JSE All-Share Index, and Mondi plc relative to the FTSE All-Share Index, for the period between 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2016.
Those indices were chosen because they are broad equity market indices of which Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, respectively, are members.

The award value shown in the 2015 Remuneration report was an estimate based on the average share price over the last three months of the performance cycle which was 14.43 for Mondi plc LTIP awards and ZAR310.44 for Mondi Limited LTIP awards.
The actual share price on vesting was 13.41 for Mondi plc LTIP awards and ZAR292.76 for Mondi Limited LTIP awards.
The total remuneration for 2015 has been restated on this basis 2 David Hathorns remuneration in 2011 included 3.9 million from the proceeds of a one-off, shareholder approved, share award under a Co-Investment Plan he participated in at the time of the Groups demerger from Anglo American plc in 2007.
Under this plan, he invested 1 million from his own funds in Mondi plc shares in August 2007.
He was eligible to receive a match of up to 250% of the number of investment shares based on a relative TSR performance measure over a four-year period.
As the TSR achieved by Mondi plc was better than the upper quintile Mondi was the top-performing company in the comparator group the committee approved the maximum vesting in accordance with the Plan rules Comparison of 2016 and 2015 remuneration of CEO versus other employees Percentage change in remuneration elements from 2015 to 2016 Salary Benefits Bonus 1 CEO 2.0% 1.8% -21.8% 2 3 4 Mondi Group 2.9% N A -2% 1 CEO remuneration is reported in euros, but denominated in pounds sterling.

This increase recognises his continued development in the role, and is also in the context of his outstanding sustained performance.
128 Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2016 Annual report on remuneration Changes to the executive team David Hathorns retirement We announced on 1 February 2017 that our existing Group Chief executive officer, David Hathorn, is retiring from the Boards at the AGMs on 11 May after some 17 years as Group Chief executive officer.
He will be succeeded as Group Chief executive officer by Peter Oswald, who has been with Mondi since 1992 and successfully led Mondis Europe & International Division since 2008.
David will continue to serve Mondi in an executive capacity during his contractual notice period to February 2018 to ensure a smooth transition.
While David continues to work in an executive capacity he will receive his existing salary and benefits, be eligible for a 2017 annual bonus subject to the normal performance conditions, and will receive a 2017 LTIP grant.
His LTIP awards will be pro-rated down for time served in accordance with shareholder guidelines, at the date he retires, and remain subject to the normal performance conditions and vesting dates.
The committee has also decided that any bonus awarded for 2017 performance, and the LTIP granted in 2017, should be subject to the limits that applied to David in 2016 and not the new higher opportunity for the Chief executive officer role referred to in the policy proposals.
David will not be eligible for an annual bonus in respect of the small portion of 2018 that he works, and will not be eligible for a 2018 LTIP grant.
If approved by shareholders as part of the new Directors Remuneration Policy DRP, the two-year post-vesting holding period on the LTIP for awards from 2017 onwards will continue to apply to Davids 2017 LTIP award after he has retired.
David will continue to receive a company pension contribution of 30% of salary for as long as he remains employed.
Peter Oswalds appointment as Group Chief executive officer Peter Oswalds base salary as Group Chief executive officer will be set at 1,050,000, which, for promotion to this top leadership role, is a 9.8% increase from his current salary of 956,000.
The new salary is less than that of his predecessor David Hathorn at an exchange rate of 1 1.16.
Peters pension allowance will remain at the percentage that applies in his current role of 25% of base salary, rather than increasing to the 30% level that applies to David Hathorn.
