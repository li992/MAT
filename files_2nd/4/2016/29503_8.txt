8.3 Remuneration Committee The Committees principal function is to determine Stagecoach Groups policy on executive remuneration and to approve specific remuneration packages and service contracts for the Groups Executive Directors and such senior members of the executive management as it is asked by the Board to consider.
The Committee also has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on our website at: http: www.
pdf 8.4 Directors remuneration policy This section sets out the remuneration policy for executive directors and non-executive directors.
The policy was approved by a binding vote of shareholders on 29 August 2014 and took effect from that date.
A complete copy of the approved remuneration policy is available on the Groups website at: http: www.
1 Key principles of the remuneration policy In determining appropriate levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee aims to provide overall packages of terms and conditions that are competitive in the UK and will attract, retain and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Groups objectives and to ensure that they are fairly rewarded for their individual responsibilities and contributions to the Groups overall performance.
The Committee believes that remuneration packages for the Executive Directors should contain meaningful performance-related elements and that the performance-related elements should be designed to align the interests of the Executive Directors and other senior managers with the interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is able to consider all relevant factors when setting the Executive Directors remuneration, including environmental, social and governance matters.
Performance targets are established to achieve consistency with the interests of shareholders, with an appropriate balance between short-term and long-term targets.
Performance targets include financial measures as well as non-financial targets, such as environmental and safety objectives.
The incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors are structured so as not to unduly increase environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the existing remuneration of the Executive Directors, making comparisons with peer companies of similar size and complexity and with other companies in the public transport industry.
Proposals for the forthcoming year are then discussed in the light of the prospects for the Group as a whole.
The Remuneration Committee is also kept informed of the salary levels of other senior executives employed by the Group.
The approach is consistent with that applied for the workforce in that we look to pay competitively with reference to the market rate for a job.
With regard to pensions, the Remuneration Committee has access to reports from pension scheme trustees and scheme actuaries regarding the cost of pension obligations.
We also consult our major shareholders in developing policy.
2Summary of remuneration policy for the Executive Directors This section of our report sets out in tabular form a summary of each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors.
The components reflect the policy that applied in the year ended 30 April 2016.

condition applies, with one half of annual awards being made based on relative total shareholder return, and the other half based on targets set for a measure of earnings per share EPS over the three-year period.
In setting stretching targets for the EPS based performance condition the Committee will take into account factors such as: The long-term expectations for the Group Analysts consensus expectations Market norms and the approach of peer group companies The level of expected underlying inflation, such that any growth target must be positive and exceed inflation.
For the Incentive Units awarded that are subject to the TSR condition, vesting will be as follows: If the TSR does not exceed the median of the comparator group, then none of the relevant Incentive Units awarded will vest and they will lapse: If the TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group which is the threshold performance level, then one-quarter 25% of the available Incentive Units will vest and the remainder will lapse: If the TSR is in the top quartile of the comparator group, then all of the available Incentive Units will vest: If the TSR is higher than the median but less than the top quartile of the comparator group, then the proportion of the Incentive Units that will vest would be between 25% and 100% of the available Incentive Units depending on the actual ranking against the comparator group.
For the Incentive Units awarded that are subject to the EPS condition, vesting will be as follows: If the EPS is below the target set by the Remuneration Committee, then none of the relevant available Incentive Units will vest and they will all lapse: If the EPS equals the target for threshold vesting set by the Remuneration Committee which is the threshold performance level, then one-quarter 25% of the available Incentive Units will vest and the remainder will lapse: If the EPS equals or exceeds the target for maximum vesting set by the Remuneration Committee then all of the available Incentive Units will vest: If the EPS is higher than the threshold vesting target but less than the maximum vesting target, then the proportion of the Incentive Units that will vest would be between 25% and 100% of the available Incentive Units adjusted on a straight line basis depending on the EPS achieved.
The performance conditions are tested over a three-year period, being the three years commencing on or around the 1 May or 1 November immediately preceding the date of the relevant award.
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-taking.
As part of the Directors Remuneration Policy, the Committee reserves the right to make minor amendments to the policies set out above for regulatory, exchange control, administrative or tax purposes.

Basic Salary fees The basic salary fees in Table 1 correspond to the amounts payable in respect of the financial year ended 30 April.
Both Executive Directors participated in pension salary sacrifice arrangements during the year and the basic salary amounts are shown gross before any salary sacrifice arrangements.
Benefits in kind and other allowances The benefits in kind shown in Table 1 are made up as follows: Reimbursement Employer TABLE 2 BENEFITS IN KIND Cash allowance in lieu Healthcare Total of home BAYE of company car benefits telephone expenses contributions 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Martin Griffiths 22,000 22,000 1,061 866 1,800 405 185 177 25,046 23,448 Ross Paterson 22,000 22,000 1,061 866 185 177 23,246 23,043 Sir Brian Souter 286 25 286 25 During the year both Executive Directors participated in the Buy As You Earn BAYE Plan.
We believe that the BAYE plan aligns the interests of employees and shareholders by allowing all UK employees of the Group to purchase shares out of salary.
It is designed to aid staff motivation and retention.
The maximum employee purchase is governed by HMRC limits and is currently 1,800 per annum.
The Group provides two matching shares for every share purchased on the first 10 of each employees monthly investment.
The amounts shown in Table 2 are the values of such matching shares allocated to directors as at the dates of allocation.
Additional shares are allocated in respect of dividends payable during the relevant period.
Details of the shares held under the BAYE plan are shown in Table 10. iii.
Performance related bonus Around the start of each financial year, the Committee agrees specific objectives for each executive director.
Following the end of each financial year, the Committee determines the annual bonus for each executive director for the year just ended.
This is based on the directors performance in achieving the set objectives.
The objectives comprise both financial objectives for the Group and individual business related objectives for each director.
For each executive director, the Group financial objectives for the year ended 30 April 2016 were to meet financial targets with respect to measures of profit before interest and taxation, earnings per share, and net debt.
For the year ended 30 April 2016, Martin Griffiths and Ross Paterson each had a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.
Details of the financial objectives applicable for 2015 16 are shown below: TABLE 3 DIRECTORS OBJECTIVES Target Achieved Potential Bonus Bonus Awarded % of basic salary % of basic salary Consolidated profit before interest and taxation PBIT from Group companies 227.6m 204.0m 23.4% Consolidated adjusted earnings per share EPS 29.8p 27.7p 23.3% Consolidated net debt Net Debt 467.6m 399.3m 23.3% 23.3% Element of bonus related to Group financial objectives 70.0% 23.3% The PBIT and EPS measures shown above are determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards but adjusted to exclude intangible asset expenses and exceptional items.
The PBIT measure also excludes any share of profit or loss from joint ventures.
The Net Debt measure shown above is determined in accordance with the definition of net debt given in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements.
The actual values achieved in respect of each of the three measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of any acquisitions and disposals that were not included in determining the target values.
For the year ended 30 April 2016, the Chief Executive had personal objectives relating to: Health and safety performance across all business units: Strategy and value creation from rail activities: The development of inter-city coach operations in North America and Europe and: Managing the risks and opportunities arising from the potential regional devolution in the UK.

5 EPP and LTIPawards during the financial year audited Tables 7 and 8 set out the awards to the Executive Directors under the Companys share schemes during the year ended 30 April 2016.
TABLE 7 LTIP AWARDS IN YEAR Awards Expected Maximum Type of Share price at granted in year total value at total value at interest time of award Basis Incentive time of grant time of grant Vesting Performance awarded of award Units Date period Martin Griffiths 25 Jun 15 Incentive 4.1700 75% of 112,715 321,582 470,022 25 Jun 18 1 May 2015 - Units basic salary 30 April 2018 10 Dec 15 Incentive 3.0470 75% of 154,258 321,582 470,024 10 Dec 18 1 Nov 2015 - Units basic salary 31 Oct 2018 Ross Paterson 25 Jun 15 Incentive 4.1700 75% of 75,143 214,387 313,346 25 Jun 18 1 May 2015 - Units basic salary 30 April 2018 10 Dec 15 Incentive 3.0470 75% of 102,838 214,385 313,347 10 Dec 18 1 Nov 2015 - Units basic salary 31 Oct 2018 Each Incentive Unit shown in Table 7 has a notional face value equal to one of the Companys ordinary shares and was granted as a cash-settled award.
The maximum and expected values shown above ignore non-market vesting conditions and do not include any assumed share price appreciation or dividends paid.
The actual number of Incentive Units if any which vest will depend on the performance conditions being achieved.
Both awards are subject to two performance conditions.
One half of the award is based on TSR, where the TSR over the performance period must exceed the median of the comparator group, which is the list of FTSE 250 companies over the period.
The amount of units awarded which are released will range from 25% to 100% depending on the actual ranking achieved.
A challenging performance target of top quartile ranking is required to achieve a 100% release of units.
No units will vest for below-threshold performance.
The other half of each award is based on targets set for a measure of EPS over a three-year period.
The portion of the award that is EPS based will attract a threshold payout level of 25% if the EPS growth over the three-year performance period is at least 15% and a 100% payout only if the EPS growth is at least 27% over the three-year performance period.
A sliding scale of vesting on a straight-line basis would be applied between these lower and upper vesting levels.
TABLE 8 EPP AWARDS IN YEAR Awards Maximum & expected Type of Share price at granted in year total value at interest time of award Basis Deferred time of grant Vesting Performance awarded of award Shares Date period Martin Griffiths 25 Jun 15 Deferred 4.1700 50% of 47,884 199,676 25 Jun 18 n a Shares annual bonus Ross Paterson 25 Jun 15 Deferred 4.1700 50% of 31,923 133,119 25 Jun 18 n a Shares annual bonus Each Deferred Share shown in Table 8 has a notional face value equal to one of the Companys ordinary shares.
The maximum and total expected values ignore non-market vesting conditions and do not include any assumed share price appreciation or dividends paid.
There are no specific performance conditions attaching to the release of these Deferred Shares because the annual bonus is already subject to performance conditions.
6 Payments to past directors audited There have been no payments 2015: Nil in excess of the fide minimis threshold to former directors during the year ended 30 April 2016 in respect of their former roles as directors.
The Company has set a fide minimis threshold of 10,000 under which it would not report such payments.
7 Payments for loss of office audited There have been no payments for loss of office to directors during the year ended 30 April 2016 2015: Nil.
8 Statement of directors shareholdings and share interests audited The Executive Directors and certain other senior executives are expected to accumulate significant shareholdings in the Company.
In the case of Executive Directors, they are each expected to accumulate an effective interest in shares in the Group with a value of at least 200% of basic salary.
A target of 100% was first introduced in 2005 and was amended to 200% in June 2014 following feedback from shareholders.
The Executive Directors are allowed five years from the date of appointment to accumulate the appropriate level of shares.
Where there have been relevant increases in basic salary or significant fluctuations in the share price of the Company, the Committee may allow a further period of three years for directors to adjust their holdings within the shareholding guideline.
For these purposes, EPP Deferred Shares will be counted on a post-tax basis only and all interests in shares will be counted at current value as at the 30 April year end.
LTIP incentive units are not included in this measurement.
The Committee noted that both directors increased their interest in the number of shares held outright during the period, and the Committee remains satisfied that both directors retained significant interests in the shares of the Company.
Martin Griffiths had an interest in shares equivalent to 226% 2015: 332% of his basic salary and Ross Paterson an interest in shares equivalent to 179% 2015: 240% of his basic salary.
Ross Paterson had an interest in shares equivalent to 240% at the start of the financial year and although the number of shares he has an interest in increased during the year, a reduction in the Companys share price has resulted in his interest falling below the target 200% of basic salary.
Consistent with the Committees policy explained above, Ross would have a further period of three years to adjust his holding in shares to achieve the shareholding guideline.

9 Performance graph The graph below charts the performance of the total shareholder return TSR share value movement plus reinvested dividends from the Companys ordinary shares over the seven years to 30 April 2016 compared with that of the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index, and the FTSE 250 Index.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index used by the Company for the TSR based performance criterion for the LTIP Scheme, while the FTSE Travel and Leisure All-Share Index is shown as the Company and a number of its peers make up a significant element of that index.

10 Percentage change in Chief Executive Remuneration audited The change in the Chief Executives remuneration from 2014 15 to 2015 16 in comparison to a comparator group of employees is shown in Table 13 below.
TABLE 13 PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN REMUNERATION FOR THE ROLE Percentage change of Chief Executive Percentage change per capita of employees in OF CHIEF ExECUTIVE the comparator group throughout both years Salary 2.0% 3.1% Benefits 6.8% 4.6% Bonus 16.4 % 7.7 % The comparator group used comprises over 300 employees including the corporate head office employees, the management teams of each of the Groups divisions and their administrative support staff.
This comparator group was used because the Committee believes it provides a sufficiently large and relative comparator group to give a reasonable understanding of underlying increases, based on similar annual bonus performance measures utilised by Group management and support functions.
The Group seeks to ensure that the basis for pay increases for Group management support functions are generally consistent with the pay rises at UK Bus and Rail operations.
11 Relative Importance of spend on pay audited The table below shows the expenditure of the Group on employee remuneration costs in the year ended 30 April 2016 and the year ended 30 April 2015.
In addition, it details the disbursements from profit made by way of dividend payments during the same periods.

13 Implementation of remuneration policy in the financial year ending 30 April 2017 In the year ending 30 April 2017, the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors remuneration policies will be implemented as follows.
13.1 Implementation of executive directors remuneration policy 8.5.
1 Fixed elements basic salary The Committee made the following 2016 17 basic salary decisions which are in line with the Directors remuneration policy.
TABLE 16 INCREASES IN BASIC SALARY 2016 17 2015 16 salary salary Percentage change Martin Griffiths 639,200 626,700 2.0% Ross Paterson 426,200 417,800 2.0% Salaries are effective from 1 May each year.
The Committee has considered the broader employee context in determining salaries.
2 Other elements The implementation of policy in relation to other elements of remuneration is in line with the Directors Remuneration Policy, and there are no changes in the maximum bonus or LTIP potential amounts as a percentage of basic salary.
Short-term incentives Annual Bonus The implementation of policy in relation to annual bonus is in line with the Directors Remuneration Policy.
Targets are approved by the Remuneration Committee around the beginning of the year.
Each executive director has a maximum potential bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, with 70% allocated over a range of demanding key financial objectives and 30% for meeting individual business related objectives.
The Committee has determined that the element of the potential bonus related to financial objectives for 2016 17 will be allocated as follows: TABLE 17 FINANCIALOBJECTIVES FOR 2016 17 BONUS Potential bonus % of the basic salary Consolidated profit before interest and taxation PBIT from Group companies 23.4 Consolidated adjusted earnings per share EPS 23.3 Consolidated net debt NetDebt 23.3 Element of bonus related to Group financial objectives 70.0 The three measures listed in Table 17 will be defined consistently with 2015 16 see note iii to Table 1, except that rail franchise bid costs will be excluded from both the target and the actual results for PBIT and EPS for the purposes of determining Directors bonus awards.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the financial element under the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose these before the end of the financial year.
The targets and achievements in respect of the year ending 30 April 2017 will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report.
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets for the individual business related objectives are commercially sensitive as they relate to internal management projects, strategic objectives and personal goals and it is not intended that these will be disclosed in advance.
The Committees intention is that a summary of these objectives will be disclosed when they are no longer considered commercially sensitive.
50% of any actual bonus earned in the year would ordinarily be deferred as shares under the EPP.
Long-term incentives LTIP awards LTIP awards vest after three years subject to performance conditions.
A summary of the intended awards during the year ending 30 April 2017 and the nature of the performance conditions are provided in Table 18 below.
TABLE 18 INTENDED LTIP AWARDS Face value of award Percentage of award Length of Award Performance at maximum vesting vesting for threshold Performance Type metric % of 2016 17 salary achievement period Martin Griffiths Incentive Units TSR relative against 75% 25% 3 years FTSE 250 Incentive Units EPSgrowth objectives 75% 25% 3 years Ross Paterson Incentive Units TSR relative against 75% 25% 3 years FTSE 250 Incentive Units EPSgrowth objectives 75% 25% 3 years page 58 | Stagecoach Group plc 132577 STC Front PRINT 132577 STC Front V12 12 07 2016 13:14 Page 59 In all cases, awards will only vest subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufficient to justify the vesting of awards.
Awards are generally made twice a year following the announcement of the Annual Results in June, and in December following the issue of the results for the half-year.
The maximum level of awards granted for an individual in relation to any financial year is limited to Incentive Units with an aggregate face value at the time of award not exceeding 150% of basic salary.
The 2016 17 awards will be split one half based on TSR performance against a comparator group of the list of FTSE 250 companies, and the other half based on a measure of earnings per share.
For the TSR based awards, the TSR must exceed the median of the comparator group and the amount of Incentive Units awarded which are released will range from 25% to 100% of the available Incentive Units depending on the actual ranking.
A top quartile ranking is required to achieve 100% release of units.
Demanding targets for the growth in earnings per share will be set for the other half of the awards based on relevant market factors and expectations for the Group as at the date of award.
13.2 Implementation of non-executive directors remuneration policy Annual fees for 2017 The implementation of policy in relation to the Non-Executive Directors is in line with the remuneration policy.
Each non-executive directors fee is set by the Board taking account of the views of each director, the specific responsibilities of each director and the fees for equivalent roles in similar companies.
The fees per annum for the Non-Executive Directors for 2015 16 and the amount set for 2016 17 are set out in Table 19 below.
