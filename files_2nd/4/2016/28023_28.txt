GOVERNANCE AND REMUNERATION DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION INTRODUCTION This section sets out how the Company has applied its remuneration policy in the year, and details how the policy will be implemented for the year 2016 17.
In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act, this section will be put to an advisory vote at the Companys AGM which is scheduled to be held on 1 July 2016.
OPERATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2016 17 A summary of the specific remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors in 2016 17 is described below: 2016 17 salaries are: Base salary Chris Loughlin: 510,000 Ian McAulay: 406,000 Susan Davy: 390,000 Susan Davy was promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer on 1 February 2015.
The Committee initially set her salary at 325,000, a level below market rates, with the intention of providing flexibility to make higher than usual increases to reflect performance and experience in the role.
This approach of setting a lower salary with the potential for higher increases following appointment is in line with the Committees normal policy.
The Committees assessment during the review was that she is now fully effective in the role, and is performing at a level which exceeds the expectations set out on her appointment.
The Committee was therefore of the view that it was appropriate to make an adjustment to her salary for 2015 16, and her salary was increased to 390,000 from 1 April 2016, the first salary increase since her appointment.
Following this adjustment, which is believed to be in line with market rates and commensurate with her predecessors salary, it is not anticipated that there will be any further increases of this nature for Susan Davy.
Accordingly, future increases are not expected to be materially different from general employee increases.
Pension and benefits No changes.
Salary supplement cash allowance of between 20% and 30% from which is deducted the employers contribution to the defined benefit or defined contribution pension schemes for the Directors.

No change to maximum opportunity of 100% of salary.
No change to operation of deferral.
50% of the bonus Annual bonus is delivered as deferred shares.
