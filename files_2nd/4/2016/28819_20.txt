C. Annual bonus outcome Annual bonuses may be awarded under the annual performance related award plan APRA.
Executive Directors receive any annual bonus awarded in March following the performance period.
The bonus is paid partially in cash and partially in deferred shares.
The deferred shares are held in trust for two years before being released, subject to the recipient still being employed by the Group.
Ordinary shares held as deferred shares will include the right to receive an enhancement equal in value to the C Shares issued during the deferral period.
Malus and clawback provisions apply where there has been: a material misstatement of audited results: serious financial irregularity which invalidates the targets set: reputational damage: material failure of risk management: a serious breach of the Groups Global Code of Conduct: or individual gross misconduct.
Clawback will apply within three years from the date of grant.
Following consultation with shareholders at the start of 2016, the Committee introduced two new measures relating to customer delivery and employee engagement, subject to any bonus in relation to these targets being underpinned by the underlying profit threshold.
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors was 180% for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for other Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2016 outturn against the performance measures, which are shown below: APRA 2016 PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND OUTTURN AUDITED GROUP PERFORMANCE Customer Employee Profit Cash delivery engagement Weighting 37.5% 37.5% 12.5% 12.5% Base 30% 650m 250m 80% 73 Target 60% 712m 169m 90% 75 Maximum 100% 790m 0 100% 78 2016 performance 713m 48m 88% 75 Bonus outturn as a % of maximum 60% 100% 54% 60% Discretion was applied to reduce the overall Group performance outturn to on-target 60% of maximum.

Customer delivery % on-time to purchase order, measured for new equipment, spare parts or equipment repair and overhaul.
Employee engagement measured through our long-standing global employee opinion survey.
For the purposes of assessing performance the Committee adjusted the actual underlying profit of 813m downwards to 713m and free cash flow of 100m downwards to 48m to remove gains from unbudgeted foreign exchange movements and cash receipts as well as restructuring payments.
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE The individual performance multiplier can increase or decrease the business outturn in a range of 0 120%, where on-target is 100%.
Personal performance objectives are set at the beginning of the year and are aligned with the Groups internal strategic priorities.
For Executive Directors these have included: Driving the transformation programme: simplification, cost reduction and improved behaviours.
Engineering excellence advancing our world-class technology.
Operational excellence embedding a lean enterprise and high-performance culture.
Capturing aftermarket value and providing outstanding service to customers.
Developing our people and our culture in a safe and ethical environment.

LTIP PSP 2016 AWARD CPS TARGETS AUDITED The cash flow per share targets for awards made in 2016 were as follows and straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Aggregate CPS over the three-year period Maximum award released % Less than 10p 0 10p 30 50p 100 2016 PSP Awards are based on CPS and TSR measures with an EPS hurdle.
As disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report, for the 2016 awards, the EPS hurdle will be measured over the period 2017 and 2018.
This change reflected business circumstances and the intended level of stretch of the EPS hurdle which is used as an underpin rather than a primary performance measure.
In recognition of the change the maximum vesting level for 2016 awards was reduced from 180% to 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and from 150% to 130% of salary for other Executive Directors.
PSP AWARDS MADE IN MARCH 2016 In 2016, Executive Directors received PSP awards in line with the remuneration policy as follows: Number Face values Performance Date of shares % of % of salary period of award awarded salary maximum end date Warren East 1 March 2016 164,202 120 150 31 December 2018 Colin Smith 1 March 2016 81,361 100 130 31 December 2018 David Smith 1 March 2016 79,882 100 130 31 December 2018 All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over a three-day period before the date of grant, being 676p for the award on 1 March 2016.
Clawback will apply for three years after the vesting of an award.
If the EPS and base CPS targets are not achieved, no awards vest.
PSP AWARDS VESTING IN MARCH 2017 The following sets out details in respect of the March 2014 PSP award, for which the final year of performance was the 2016 financial year.
Subject to performance conditions, the vesting date of these awards is in March 2017, three years after the award was made.

All salary increases for management are being deferred until September 2017.
Base salaries from September 2017 will be: Warren East 943,500.
Stephen Daintith 680,000 expected to take up his role in Spring 2017.
Benefits There will be no change to our approach to benefits in 2017, which includes car or car allowance, financial planning assistance, insurances and other benefits.
Pensions There will be no change to our approach to pensions in 2017.
Pension arrangements will be: Warren East: cash allowance of 25% of salary.
Stephen Daintith: cash allowance of 25% of salary.
Annual bonus For 2017, bonuses will be awarded using a simple additive approach: 80% of the award will be based on Group performance.
20% of the award will be based on individual performance.
For 2017, the Group measures will be unchanged: Profit 37.5%.
Maximum opportunities will remain unchanged: Chief Executive 180% of salary.
Other Executive Directors 150% of salary.
LTIP awards For awards to be granted in 2017 performance measures will be weighted: 60% on CPS.
20% on relative TSR versus FTSE 100 and Global S&P Index, to recognise that Rolls-Royce is a global company.
Performance will be measured over three years to 31 December 2019.
Performance targets will be: CPS EPS Relative TSR Threshold 20% vesting 60p 115p Median Between median Mid 50% vesting 80p 135p and upper quartile Maximum 100% vesting 110p 160p Upper quartile Performance below threshold will result in that element lapsing in full.
The above targets are not an indication of forecast numbers for the three-year period.
Methodologies CPS calculated as reported cash flow before the cost of business acquisitions or proceeds of disposals, foreign exchange translation effects, special payments into pension schemes and payments to shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
CPS is cumulative over a three-year period.
The Committee will review CPS performance to ensure that it is a fair reflection of achievements over the period.
EPS calculated as cumulative absolute underlying EPS over the three-year performance period.
With the introduction of IFRS 15 in 2018, the first three-year period starting in 2017 will use existing contract accounting, but will be restated in 2018 under IFRS 15.
The Committee will ensure that translated targets are based on the same underlying assumptions under both accounting bases.
Relative TSR measured 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 100 and 50% against the constituents of the S&P Global Industrials index.
Award sizes for maximum performance Chief Executive: 250% of salary.
Other Executive Directors: 225% of salary.
Threshold vesting at 20% equates to 50% of salary for the Chief Executive and 45% of salary for other Executive Directors.
LTIP awards will be subject to an additional shareholding period of two years following the three-year performance period.
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.
The SFO, DoJ and MPF agreements relate to legacy matters and the legal judgment was clear that there was no culpability in relation to existing management.
The future impact of these agreements are therefore excluded from incentive targets.

They include both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
In the defined benefit pension schemes normal retirement age is 62.
During the year, the Group restructured its UK defined benefit arrangements.
Four of the five UK schemes merged together into a consolidated scheme, renamed the Rolls-Royce UK Pension Fund.
The merged scheme is estimated to have a material surplus on its statutory funding basis, with a largely fide-risked investment strategy.
All future defined benefit accrual will be provided from this scheme limited to employees who joined the Group before 1 April 2007.
The scheme merger will simplify future administration and governance.
As part of this merger, three transferring schemes are being wound up and over 3,400 former employees with benefits below statutory limits elected to receive lump sums in exchange for their existing benefits.
The liabilities of the fifth scheme, the Vickers Group Pension Scheme have been fully insured with Legal & General Assurance Company Limited and that scheme is also in the process of being fully wound up.
Neither of these transactions required any additional funding by the Group.
John Rishton, who left the Company and started to receive his pension on 2 July 2015, was a member of one of the Groups UK defined contribution pension schemes and received employer contributions restricted to the annual allowance limits with any excess paid as a cash allowance.
The cash allowance was calculated as equivalent to the cost of the pension contributions after allowing for National Insurance costs.
Warren East and David Smith receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension accrual.
Stephen Daintith will receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension accrual.
Colin Smith opted out of future pension accrual with effect from 1 April 2006 and opted out of salary linkage with effect from 30 November 2015.
