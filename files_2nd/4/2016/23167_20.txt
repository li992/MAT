Remuneration Report HOW OUR POLICY IS LINKED TO OUR STRATEGY The principles behind, and the reasons for, the overall remuneration structure that we have adopted for our Executive Directors are directly related to our long term strategic goal of delivering shareholder value through the profitable growth of a quality business.
Since the flotation of the Company our Executive remuneration has been structured specifically: X To pay fairly and appropriately for an individuals role and responsibilities: X To reward strong performance: X To be focused on long term value creation: X To align Executives strongly with shareholders through share ownership.
The majority of the Executive Directors potential remuneration is variable and performance-related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder return.
Discretion is allowed in certain circumstances to ensure rewards are appropriate and overall levels of pay are analysed carefully each year.
This is consistent with delivery of the objectives set out in our corporate strategy, which are all long term in nature: namely the growth of like-for-like sales in store: obtaining national coverage from rolling out new stores: and growing sales and profit in the home delivery channel.
Our approach is also in keeping with the family origin of the business, and is important to the Adderley family who remain our majority shareholders.
It is our intention to maintain a simple and transparent remuneration structure for the benefit of all parties.
Introduction This Directors Remuneration Report is divided into three sections: the Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, set out on page 52: the Policy Report: and the Annual Report on Implementation.
The Policy Report sets out the Directors remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 24 November 2015, and took effect from that date.
This was a binding vote and the policy remains in place until the AGM in 2018.
No payment may be paid to a Director or past Director unless it is consistent with the approved policy unless shareholder approval is sought.
The Annual Report on Implementation sets out how the policies approved in November 2014 and November 2015 have been applied during the financial year being reported on and how policy will be applied in the coming year.
This report will be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting in November 2016, although the vote on the implementation report is advisory.
This report complies with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Amendment Regulations 2013, as well as the UK Corporate Governance Code and the UKLA Listing Rules.

indd 59 12 10 2016 09:56:44 governance Remuneration Report CONTINUED The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy, where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, and in relation to an award over shares, the terms of payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
The Committee may also make minor changes to this policy which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approval, but taking into account the interests of shareholders.
Performance measures and how targets are set The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that it believes are: z Aligned with the Groups strategic goals.
z Unambiguous and easy to calculate.
z Transparent to Directors and shareholders.
Annual bonus For 2015-16 and 2016-17, 80% of the annual bonus is linked to PBT and 20% to personal and strategic objectives.
Each Directors annual bonus is therefore linked primarily to delivery of Group financial performance, but also to personal performance and contribution to the strategic progress of the Group.
The PBT target is set by the Remuneration Committee each year, taking into account market consensus and broker expectations.
Personal and strategic objectives are set at the commencement of the year and assessed by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee reserves the right to adjust the financial performance target or change the performance condition if justified by the circumstances, for example if there was a major capital transaction.
For future years, the Committee will determine the financial measures and the weighting of financial and non-financial measures based on specific business priorities in a particular year.
LTIP The Remuneration Committee considered the use of EPS as a performance measure carefully when the Company was floated in 2006, and has discussed it with shareholders regularly.
EPS is believed to be closely aligned to the drivers of growth for the business and in the long term, EPS performance is expected to be reflected in shareholder value.
EPS is a more suitable performance measure for Dunelm than for many other companies and it is therefore considered appropriate to use it as a single measure for the LTIP.
The use of EPS as a primary measure for Dunelms LTIP is considered appropriate because of the low level of leverage in the business and because the capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital.
The EPS target for the LTIP is based on growth in EPS compared to the increase in the Index of Retail Prices RPI over the performance period.
The targets that apply to awards that are outstanding are set out in the Policy table on pages 55 to 59.
The number of shares comprised in an award or the performance target which applies may be adjusted by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the plan rules if justified by the circumstances, for example, if there were a major capital transaction.
Any amendment and the reason for it would be fully disclosed.
A copy of the plan rules is available from the Company Secretary on request.
LTIP awards made to Executive Directors prior to approval of 2015 policy may vest on their original terms.

The Committee would explain the rationale for the remuneration package in the next annual report of the Company.
In addition, on hiring an external candidate the Committee may make arrangements to buy out remuneration that the individual has forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The Committee will generally seek to structure buyout awards and payments on a comparable basis to remuneration arrangements forfeited.
These awards or payments are excluded from the maximum level of variable pay referred to in the policy tables: however, the Committees intention is that the value awarded or paid would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.
The Committee does not intend to use any discretion in this section to make a non-performance related incentive payment for example a golden hello.
In order to implement the arrangements described, the Committee may rely on the exemption in Listing Rule 9.4.

On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and pay for similar roles in companies of similar size and complexity in the market.

Keith Down joined the Board on 7 December 2015.
His basic salary, benefits, pension and bonus are pro-rated from that date.
As disclosed in last years report, the Committee agreed to pay Keith Down relocation expenses of up to 35,000.
The actual amount paid of 19,365 is included in the benefits column above.
David Stead retired from the Board on 31 December 2015.
His basic salary, benefits and pension are pro-rated to that date.
He has received a time prorated percentage of his FY16 annual bonus entitlement, after applying the financial performance criteria over the full performance period and the personal performance criteria to the date of his cessation of employment.
Benefits include the cost to the Company of a car allowance and private health insurance for the individual and their family health insurance waived by David Stead.
The 2014-15 value also includes the taxable benefit in respect of the car and chauffeur provided to Will Adderley in connection with his role prior to 10 September 2015.
Annual bonus is the amount earned in respect of the financial year 2015-16.
Details of how this was calculated are set out below.
The LTIP award number for 2016 is the value of the LTIP award vesting whose three year performance period ends on the last day of the financial period being reported 2015-16.
Details of how this value was calculated are set out in the note to table 5.
The first LTIP grant to John Browett and Keith Down was made in December 2015.
Therefore there are no LTIP awards vesting to them for 2016.
The comparable figure for 2014-15 is the actual value of the 2012 LTIP award which vested in favour of David Stead on 20 November 2015 based on the mid-market price on 20 November 2015, of 965.5p.
The comparable figure in the 2014-15 annual report was based on the number of shares in the 2012 LTIP award due to vest in favour of David Stead on 20 November 2015 calculated using the average share price over the three months preceding the end of the performance period on 4 July 2015, which was 915.7p.
Pension is 20% of base salary for John Browett, 15% of base salary for Keith Down and 10% for David Stead.
Will Adderley waived his entitlement to pension from 1 July 2015.
From 1 July 2015 the following changes to base salary fee were implemented: Will Adderleys salary was reduced to 1 per annum: David Steads salary increased by 2% in line with the Company-wide award: the base fee for Non-Executive Directors was increased to 48,000 and the Committee Chair and SID fee increased to 6,000 per annum.
Andy Harrisons fee was increased to 200,000 per annum with effect from 8 July 2015 when he assumed his position as Chairman.
From 1 July 2016, John Browett and Keith Downs base salary was increased by 2%, in line with the Company-wide award.
Will Adderleys base salary is held at 1 per annum.
The fees for the Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors were also increased by 2%.

indd 67 12 10 2016 09:56:46 governance Remuneration Report CONTINUED Annual bonus Executive Directors were awarded an annual performance-related cash bonus for 2015-16 with a maximum potential payment of 125% of salary for John Browett and Keith Down, and 100% of salary for David Stead the bonus for both David Stead and Keith Down being pro-rated by time in line with service over the financial year.
For all three Directors, the performance condition was linked to PBT versus budget 80%, and performance against personal and strategic objectives 20%.
The Committee has the ability to apply judgement to increase or decrease the amount payable by application of the formula, although no more than the maximum potential opportunity would be paid.
Financial target 80% of bonus opportunity For the period ended 2 July 2016, budget PBT was 128.2m.
The financial target set was that no bonus would be paid until PBT reaches 120.5m and maximum bonus will be paid at 134.6m.
Between those numbers, bonus would be payable calculated on a straight-line basis.
Market consensus for 2015-16 PBT at the date the target was set in early September 2015 was 130.6m.
Reported PBT of 128.9m for 2015-16 has therefore given rise to a bonus payable of 47.12% of the maximum for this element of the bonus, meaning 235,600 to John Browett, 93,813 to Keith Down pro-rated from 7 December 2015 and 52,809 for David Stead pro-rated to 31 December 2015.
Strategic and personal objectives 20% of bonus opportunity Both John Browett and Keith Down were new in role during the financial year, and the strategic initiatives which underpin delivery of the Groups strategy were in the course of being formalised by the Executives during the second part of the year.
Their strategic and personal bonus targets were linked to progress against these initiatives, albeit that in view of their stage of development hard KPIs could not be set for all of them.
The Committee therefore recognised that as a result they would need to form a holistic view of performance.
The FY17 bonus objectives are also linked to delivery of specific strategic objectives and have firm KPIs.

In the case of the award maturing on 7 October 2016, this would equate to a maximum of 40,976 shares.
