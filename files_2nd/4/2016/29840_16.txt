Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT Dear Shareholder, In accordance with best practice, I am pleased to provide this introduction to the Remuneration Committee Report which appears in full on pages 51 to 76.
The Committee believes that remuneration packages should be competitive, align the interests of management with those of external shareholders, and both incentivise and reward superior long term performance.
In particular, we note the importance of continuing to strengthen not just the very senior management team, but also those in more junior management positions, from whom the next generation of senior management is most likely to be found.
This succession planning, at all levels, is key to securing the continuing success of the Company, and positioning us to take advantage of future opportunities as they arise.
A necessary ingredient is the effective retention of the talented individuals we attract, as they gain knowledge and experience within what is becoming a highly complex business.
We are therefore proposing a material change to the Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting by introducing a new long-term incentive plan LTIP 2016.
LTIP 2016 is designed to attract and retain high calibre individuals, by delivering entrepreneurial rewards throughout the management team as both an incentive and a reward for creating significant real shareholder value over a 10 year time-frame.
LTIP 2016 will comprise the issue to participants of a new class of growth shares, which will potentially become convertible into ordinary shares over a period of 3-10 years following the achievement of stretching targets.
If these targets are not achieved, then the growth shares will lapse with no value to participants.
Because the intention behind introducing LTIP 2016 is only to reward real increases in shareholder value, the hurdle which has been chosen is a direct link to growth in the Companys share price, with no value accruing to participants unless either: i the share price has approximately doubled to at least 20: or ii at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the adjusted earnings per share of the Company has doubled.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 51 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The participants are being set further stretching targets of growing the share price to at least 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 respectively: as each of these hurdles is achieved, the maximum number of shares issued in aggregate to participants increases as follows: SHARE MAXIMUM APPROX DILUTION FOR PRICE NO.
OF SHARES EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS 20 Nil NIL 20 1,625,000 1.9% 25 2,437,500 2.8% 30 3,250,000 3.7% 35 4,062,500 4.7% 40 4,875,000 5.6% 45 5,687,500 6.6% 50 6,500,000 7.5% Although it is anticipated that each participant will receive a single award of growth shares under LTIP 2016, these will vest progressively over a 10 year period with 25% vesting after 3 years, 25% after 5 years, 25% after 7 years, and the final 25% vesting after 10 years.
In all cases, conversion is subject to the relevant hurdles having been achieved on the conversion date and transfer restrictions will apply on a proportion of the shares for up to two years.
This ensures that the interests of management and shareholders are fully aligned.
For any future grants, other than those made immediately following adoption of the LTIP 2016, stretching hurdles will be set by the Committee that will not be below those which apply to initial participants.
Because one of the key drivers behind the introduction of LTIP 2016 is the retention of key individuals over the longer term, any growth shares issued to a participant will generally lapse if they cease to be employed by the Company before they have vested.
In accordance with best practice, both malus and clawback provisions are also being included.
The Committee recognises that the current approval it holds to issue up to 15% of the equity for existing share incentive schemes is higher than would usually be found, and therefore intends to reduce the current limit for existing share schemes to 12%.
Although the total theoretical maximum dilution following approval of LTIP 2016 would increase to 20%, because of the stretching hurdles contained in LTIP 2016 the maximum would not reach 15% ie: the current limit unless the share price exceeds 25 ie: an increase of c. 250%, and would only reach 20% once the share price exceeds 50 ie: an increase of c. 500%.
Following approval by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, the Committee will keep the proposed amended remuneration policy under review, in accordance with legislation, and expects to submit an updated version to the Annual General meeting to be held in 2019.
52 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Executive directors salaries are reviewed annually.
During the year covered by this Report, the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each received an increase of 1.5% taking their salaries to 426,000, 461,825 and 406,000 respectively.
This rise was in line with the Companys standard increase.
Charles Wigoder and Andrew Lindsay will also receive an increase of 1.25% for the year to 31 March 2017 which again is in line with the Companys cost of living increase.
The Committee has reviewed Nick Schoenfelds first full year performance and believes that he warrants an above inflation increase bringing his salary to 456,000.
At present, executive directors do not receive annual bonuses in either cash or shares.
The Committee keeps this practice under consideration but believes that the grant of market price incentives combined with the new LTIP 2016 will provide long term retention and motivation.
On 30 November 2015, Andrew Lindsay exercised his rights granted under the JSOP in 2011 over 500,000 shares having met the requisite performance conditions.
The exercise was satisfied by the transfer to him of 247,362 shares, representing the value of the gain made on these rights.
The JSOP expired on 30 March 2016, and no further options were awarded to Andrew Lindsay during the year.
As outlined in last years report, the Committee exceptionally decided to reissue the 300,000 options over ordinary shares that were awarded to Nick Schoenfeld upon his appointment to the Board in January 2015.
In light of the fall in the Companys share price during the second quarter of 2015 relating to events predating his appointment the Committee felt it appropriate that his particular circumstances should be taken into consideration having only recently joined the Board.
In conclusion, I should like to thank shareholders for their support and engagement during the year.
Julian Schild Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 13 June 2016 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 53 REMUNERATION POLICY REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding the policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the executive directors and members of senior management of the Company.
It meets regularly to review and set all elements of the remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company.
It also exercises all the powers of the Board in relation to the operation of the Companys share incentive schemes, including the grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee met formally four times during the year and details of attendance at this meeting are provided in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 40.
The Committees principal activities during the year included: reviewing and approving executive remuneration packages: monitoring senior management remuneration packages: reviewing and approving the issue of share options to the Chief Financial Officer, certain employees and independent distributors of the Company: and determining the performance conditions attached to the issue of certain share options.
REMUNERATION POLICY INTRODUCTION The Companys overall remuneration policy remains to ensure that the executive directors and other senior managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall long term performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company.
Accordingly, we propose to amend our remuneration policy by introducing a new long term incentive plan LTIP 2016, details of which are set out elsewhere in this report and in the resolution being proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This has the potential to provide entrepreneurial rewards to the extended senior management team for creating significant real shareholder value over a 10 year time-frame.
The Companys remuneration policy will continue to be based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors and senior management should be directly aligned with those of external shareholders, and this is best achieved through the use of share incentive plans.
The Committee believes that share incentive awards granted at market value, and or the issue of growth shares under the proposed LTIP 2016, provide a far more transparent method by which to align directly each directors interests with all shareholders when compared to the payment of regular annual cash bonuses based on short-term performance measures.
In the light of the focus on share incentive awards rather than cash bonuses the Committee believes it continues to be appropriate to grant meaningful share awards in blocks rather than using a phased approach as set out in the Corporate Governance Code.
54 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The outstanding awards made under share incentive schemes prior to the approval of the Companys remuneration policy at the AGM in July 2014 were broadly consistent with that policy and, for the avoidance of doubt, will in most cases remain in place until exercise.
The proposed remuneration policy described in this part of the report was prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013.
The existing policy was duly approved by the Companys shareholders at the AGM on 15 July 2014 and was intended to apply for the three years beginning on that date, however certain amendments are being proposed at the forthcoming AGM as set out in this report.
The Committee will continue to review the amended remuneration policy annually to ensure it remains appropriate for the Companys requirements and consistent with market practice.

References to the JSOP have been removed from these tables as it has now expired.
60 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Committee chose the performance measures described in the table above as these are deemed to align directly the executive directors interests with those of all shareholders in an easily understood and transparent manner.
Share Incentive Schemes excluding LTIP 2016 The performance measures comprise a combination of relative total shareholder return TSR, Adjusted EPS excluding share incentive scheme charges and amortisation of intangible assets and service number growth measures.
Adjusted EPS is considered appropriate as a key strategic objective of the Company if it is to drive profitable growth in each year.
It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which considers shareholder value creation and reflects market expectations of future performance, and absolute service number growth which, when achieved responsibly, will also drive long-term value creation.
The use of relative TSR and Adjusted EPS growth measures provides a combined focus on the Companys financial performance and shareholder value creation.
Targets for Adjusted EPS are set by reference to internal budgeting plans and external market expectations.
TSR targets are set on a standard practice, median to upper quartile ranking range.
Only 30% of share incentive awards vest for threshold levels of performance.
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to change the composition of performance conditions for future grants to directors should this be required in order to reflect appropriately the strategic responsibilities of the particular director concerned.
LTIP 2016 The Committee has chosen growth in the Companys share price as the primary measure for LTIP 2016 because it considers it is the best way to link the rewards received by participants with the value that has been created for shareholders.
However, the Committee recognises that share price is not in the control of senior management, and periods of stock market volatility may coincide with the dates on which growth shares issued under the plan are due to vest.
Discretion has therefore been given to the Committee to include the alternative stretching growth metric of adjusted earnings per share, for the purpose of determining the number of ordinary shares in the Company received by participants on each vesting date.
ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY The bar chart below seeks to illustrate the potential rewards available under the proposed remuneration policy for the coming financial year under varying levels of performance in relation to Share Incentive Schemes.
For the purposes of the illustration the values assume the maximum grant of share incentive awards during the year under the Share Incentive Schemes, no grants under LTIP 2016 which is subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, and no annual cash bonuses are paid.
However, as outlined in the above table, the Committee reserves the right to bring or carry forward any unused annual share incentive scheme or LTIP 2016 allowances.
Therefore, share incentives might not be awarded during a particular year, and or share incentive awards may be larger than 200% of base salary in any one year.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 61 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED The amounts included for share incentive awards are based on one third of the market value of the shares under option, although the awards have no realisable value inherent at the date of grant: awards granted under LTIP 2016 in future will have a different valuation basis.
The amounts for pensions and benefits included in the fixed remuneration figure have been calculated on the same basis as payments made for the year ended 31 March 2016.
The potential rewards available for on-target performance under share incentive schemes have been based on 30% vesting of share incentive awards.
All performance measures or targets for share incentive scheme awards relate to more than one financial year.

64 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION The Committees approach to recruitment is to pay a sufficient amount necessary to attract the best candidates to the particular role.
In determining these amounts the Committee will be mindful of, inter alia, prevailing market rates, the chosen candidates skills, knowledge and experience, and their existing location and position.
Where the candidate has variable remuneration arrangements with a previous employer that will be lost on leaving employment, the Company will consider offering a sign-on award in compensation for the value foregone, either as an award under an existing share incentive scheme or a bespoke award under the Listing Rules exemption available for this purpose.
The face and or expected values of the award s offered will not materially exceed the value ascribed to the award s foregone, and would normally follow the same vesting timing and form i. e. cash or shares save that the Committee may award the whole of the value in shares, at its discretion.
The application of performance conditions would be considered and, where appropriate, the awards could be made subject to claw-back in certain circumstances.
For material amounts the Committee would, where practicable, consult with key institutional shareholders ahead of committing to make any such sign-on awards, and in any event a full explanation of any amounts awarded, an explanation of why it was necessary and a breakdown of the awards to be made will be announced to the markets at the time of granting.
For the avoidance of doubt, should a new director be internally promoted from the Companys senior management team they will not be expected to give up or amend any element of remuneration granted to them prior to becoming a director which is inconsistent with the remuneration policy set out above.
Any new executive directors remuneration package would include the same elements, and be subject to the same constraints, as those of the existing executive directors as outlined in the above policy table.

Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 65 REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS The Chairman of the Committee engages with certain of the Companys largest shareholders who have expressed an interest in being consulted in relation to remuneration matters to understand their expectations and monitor any changes in their views.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP The Committee considers pay levels across the organisation when setting remuneration for all directors both executives and non-executives.
However this review is undertaken against a background of ensuring that the prevailing market rates for all levels of employee in the organisation are taken into account in order to attract, retain and motivate the best employees at each level.
In relation to directors, specific account is taken of any change in the level of responsibility of the director whether through a change in role or the increased size of the Company or an increase in experience and knowledge of the Company and its markets which may not be relevant to roles elsewhere in the Company.
The Company does not deem it appropriate to formally consult with employees regarding the determination of the directors remuneration policy as the broad remuneration structure for directors mirrors that of all employees, i. e. the payment of a base salary, benefits and share incentive scheme awards at market price and or LTIP 2016 awards.
However, employees have the opportunity to make comments on any aspect of the Companys activities through an employee survey and any comments made which are relevant to directors remuneration would be considered by the Committee.
66 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 and Schedule 8 of the Large and MediumSized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013 the Regulations, has been approved by the Board of directors for submission to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The sections under the headings Single Total Figure of Remuneration, parts of Share Incentive Schemes and Pension Schemes have been subject to external audit.
SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION The Committee recommended increases to the annual base salaries of Executive Chairman Charles Wigoder, Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay and Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld during the year as follows: Charles Wigoder - increased from 420,000 to 426,300: Andrew Lindsay - increased from 455,000 to 461,825: and Nick Schoenfeld - increased from 400,000 to 406,000.
These increases broadly reflected the average increase in the base salaries of the majority of the Companys employees.
In addition, share options with performance conditions attached were issued to Mr Schoenfeld during the year, details of which are set out below in this report.

Mr Lindsay held share incentive awards under the Companys Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP where final vesting was determined as a result of the achievement of performance conditions relating to the financial year to 31 March 2015.
However, it should be noted that as at 31 March 2015 Mr Lindsay had not exercised his right to realise the gain made under the JSOP as the vesting period for the award commenced on 1 April 2015.
Mr Lindsay exercised his rights under the JSOP on 30 November 2015, details of which are set out below in this report.
SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES The Company has two conventional share option plans, and also had a Joint Share Ownership Plan which expired on 30 March 2016.
The first share option plan and the JSOP are available to employees, and the second share option plan is available to the Companys independent distributors.
The Company has also established a new Save As You Earn share option plan the Employee SAYE Share Option Plan for employees during the year.
Following the fall in the Companys share price following the trading update issued on 16 April 2015, the Committee felt that it was important to ensure that employees and distributors at all levels remained motivated and committed to the Company.
As described in the previous years annual report, and in the best interests of the Company, it decided to offer all employees and distributors with existing options with an exercise price above the prevailing market price the opportunity to have their existing options cancelled and to receive new options in their place.
In total replacement options over 746,950 shares including 300,000 to Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld as detailed below were issued to employees and distributors as a result of this proposal.
68 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements The Employee Share Option Plan Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the Companys employee share option plan and be issued with market price options over shares in the Company, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
The Committee recognises that the collective contribution of all employees is critical to the success of the Company and continues to believe that the granting of share options at all levels within the organisation generates employee loyalty and helps to ensure that staff turnover is kept to a minimum and below the levels seen across the industry for employees passing their probationary periods.
The Employee SAYE Share Option Plan The Employee SAYE Share Option Plan enables employees of the group to acquire shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner using monies saved from salary over a three or five year period.
A summary of the principal terms of the Employee SAYE Share Option Plan were set out in the Appendix to the 2015 AGM circular sent to all shareholders.
The Joint Share Ownership Plan Awards made through the JSOP provide participants with a joint interest in tranches of shares which are held until vesting by an independent employee benefit trust the JSOP Share Trust.
The trustee of the JSOP Share Trust is Zedra Trust Company Guernsey Limited formerly Barclays Wealth Trustees Guernsey Limited.
The value to participants of awards made under the JSOP is based upon the growth in the value of the Companys shares from the date of grant in a similar manner to the value achieved through participation in the conventional share option scheme.
However, participants in the JSOP only receive value to the extent that the share price increase exceeds a compound annual growth rate of at least five per cent the Hurdle Rate.
On vesting, participants receive any gain over the Hurdle Rate on the tranche of shares in which they hold a joint interest, with all the gain below the Hurdle Rate being retained by the JSOP Share Trust.
In addition, awards made under the JSOP to executive directors will only vest to the extent applicable performance conditions relating to the financial and trading performance of the Company are met.
The JSOP terminated on 30 March 2016 in accordance with the rules of the scheme five years after the date of adoption by the Board and shareholders.
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide incentives and rewards to those distributors who have been most successful in gathering new Members for the Company.
These distributors, whilst not being employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future growth, and it is the opinion of the Committee that this plan can in some cases be an important factor in their motivation.
Statement of Directors Shareholding and Share Interests audited Details of the directors shareholdings are set out in the Directors Report on page 77.
As set out in the Future Remuneration Policy Table of the Companys Remuneration Policy, a target level of share ownership is not stipulated for directors, however, subject to personal circumstances and existing shareholdings they are encouraged to retain 25% of shares issued as a result of the exercise of share incentive awards.

The performance conditions in relation to the JSOP award were all fully achieved as at 31 March 2015 and this was detailed in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Mr Lindsay exercised his rights granted under the JSOP over 500,000 ordinary shares on 30 November 2015.
Under the rules of the JSOP, Mr Lindsay was entitled to receive any increase in the value of the 500,000 shares over the share price at the date of grant on 31 March 2011 of 4.55, plus an annual compound growth rate of five per cent which together equated to 5.71 per share on 30 November 2015.
In accordance with the rules of the JSOP, the Committee elected to satisfy the exercise of Mr Lindsays rights under the JSOP by instructing the transfer of 247,362 of the 500,000 ordinary shares to Mr Lindsay, representing the value of the gain made on these rights at the closing market price for ordinary shares on 30 November 2015 of 11.31.
On 1 July 2014 300,000 share options were awarded to Mr Lindsay under the terms of the Employee Share Option Scheme.
The extent to which these options will vest will depend on the average growth, weighted 40% by reference to adjusted EPS growth, 40% by reference to relative TSR growth and 20% by reference to service number growth, achieved across the three annual performance measures summarised in the table below: PERCENTAGE OF OPTIONS ADJUSTED EPS RELATIVE SERVICE NUMBER 1 VESTING GROWTH TSR GROWTH GROWTH 100% CPI 12.5% Upper quartile 10.0% 30% CPI 5.0% Median 5.0% 2 30% -100% CPI 5.0% -12.5% Median Upper quartile 5.0% -10.0% NIL CPI 5.0% Below median 5.0% 1 Company TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts 2 Percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis The base year for the Adjusted EPS performance measure will be the Adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 March 2014.
Mr Nick Schoenfeld Options over 300,000 ordinary shares were granted to Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld on his appointment to the Board on 7 January 2015 under the terms of the Employee Share Option Scheme.
However, as described in the last annual report and in the light of the fall in the Companys share price following the release of the Trading Update on 16 April 2015, which set out details of certain issues related to historical accounting estimates pre-dating Mr Schoenfelds appointment to the Board, the Committee decided to cancel the options issued to Mr Schoenfeld on 7 January 2015 and re-issue the same number of options to him on 13 July 2015.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 71 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED The extent to which these options will vest will depend on the average growth, weighted 40% by reference to adjusted EPS growth, 40% by reference to relative TSR growth and 20% by reference to service number growth, achieved across the three annual performance measures summarised in the table below: PERCENTAGE OF OPTIONS ADJUSTED EPS RELATIVE SERVICE NUMBER 1 VESTING GROWTH TSR GROWTH GROWTH 100% CPI 10.0% Upper quartile 10.0% 30% CPI 5.0% Median 5.0% 2 30% -100% CPI 5.0% -10.0% Median Upper quartile 5.0% -10.0% NIL CPI 5.0% Below median 5.0% 1 Company TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts 2 Percentage of shares to be calculated on a straight line basis The base year for the Adjusted EPS performance measure will be the Adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Provisions to withhold or recover gains relating to these options in the event of fraud or malus committed by Mr Schoenfeld are included in the conditions of the award.
These options will vest in five discrete tranches over three, four, five, six and seven year periods as set out in the table above.
The largest tranche of options represents shares with a face value of 985,000 equating to approximately 242% of Mr Schoenfelds annual base salary.
However, it should be noted that as market price options their value to Mr Schoenfeld rests solely on the increase in the Companys share price from the point of grant.
In accordance with guidance in the FRCs Lab Project Report: Reporting of pay and performance issued in March 2013, the value of market price share options can be measured as one third of the market value of the shares under option.
The value of these options granted to Mr Schoenfeld under this measure would therefore represent approximately 80% of his annual base salary for the year.
Under this measure the value of each of the other four tranches of options represents approximately 40% of Mr Schoenfelds annual base salary.
DIRECTORS CONTRACTS OF SERVICE There are Service Contracts or Letters of Appointment for Charles Wigoder 5 May 2011, Andrew Lindsay 5 May 2011, Nick Schoenfeld 9 October 2014, Julian Schild 25 May 2010, Melvin Lawson 27 September 2006, and Michael Pavia 13 December 2006.
These provide notice periods of three months on either side for the non-executive directors and the following notice periods for the executive directors: Mr Wigoder twelve months on either side and Mr Lindsay and Mr Schoenfeld each with six months on either side.
PENSION SCHEMES AUDITED The Company makes no contributions to the pensions of any current directors except to Mr Lindsay and Mr Schoenfeld, details of which are shown within the table on page 67.
72 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements PERFORMANCE GRAPH SHOWING TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The following graph shows the Companys performance measured by total shareholder return compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index and the FTSE 350 for the period 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2016.
As noted in previous years, the FTSE All Share Telecommunications Index was initially selected at a time when a larger proportion of the Companys revenues related to the supply of telephony services: only approximately 17% of the Companys revenues are now generated from such telephony services.
The FTSE 350 Index is included as a further comparator in the light of the fact that there are no sector specific indices containing directly comparable quoted companies supplying a broad range of services similar to that provided by the Company.

No share incentive awards vested to the Chief Executive in the years ended 31 March 2013, 2014 and 2016.
PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE REMUNERATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE The following table shows the change in certain aspects of the remuneration of Mr Lindsay.

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE SPEND ON PAY The Regulations require an illustration of the significance of the Companys expenditure on pay in the context of its operations.
Set out below is a summary of the Companys levels of expenditure on pay and other significant cash outflows to key stakeholders.
CASH OUTFLOWS TO KEY STAKEHOLDERS 2016 2015 CHANGE 000 000 % Wages and salaries 27,495 23,698 16.0% Dividends paid 34,331 30,230 13.6% Corporation tax and social security costs paid 11,404 11,506 0.9 % 74 Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL YEAR Base Salaries The Committee recommended that increases to the base salaries of the executive directors for the forthcoming year ended 31 March 2017, with effect from 1 April 2016, be made as described below.
Executive Chairman Charles Wigoders annual base salary was increased from 426,300 to 431,629 and the annual base salary of Chief Executive Andrew Lindsay was increased from 461,825 to 467,598, these increases being in line with the increase of 1.25% in the base salaries of the majority of the Companys employees.
The annual base salary of Chief Financial Officer Nick Schoenfeld was increased from 406,000 to 456,000, reflecting his increased knowledge and experience of the Company following joining the Board in January 2015.
LTIP 2016 It is intended that up to 30,000 growth shares will be offered to both Andrew Lindsay and Nick Schoenfeld i. e. up to 60,000 growth shares in aggregate as soon as reasonably practical after LTIP 2016 has been approved by shareholders.
As a pre-condition, it is anticipated that they will waive their rights over some or all of their existing share options, such that there will be no increase in the maximum total possible dilution i. e: if the 600,000 share options held by Andrew Lindsay and Nick Schoenfeld in aggregate had vested in full as a result of the introduction of LTIP 2016.
Other benefits Directors remuneration in relation to pension contributions and other benefits for the year will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
SHAREHOLDER VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT As set out in the Remuneration Policy, the Committee encourages dialogue with the Companys major shareholders regarding remuneration matters and will endeavour to consult with these shareholders ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
Details of the votes cast in relation to the remuneration policy and report at last years AGM are set out below: 2015 AGM % To approve the 2015 Remuneration Report Votes cast in favour & Chairman discretion 39,195,945 80.29 Votes cast against 9,621,975 19.71 Total 48,817,920 100.00 In addition to the above there were 671,642 votes withheld.
The Committee understands that a significant factor in relation to the relatively high number of votes cast against the Remuneration Report related to concerns raised around the proposed cancellation and reissue of options with an exercise price above the prevailing market price.
However the Committee firmly believes that the proposal was in the best interests of the Company and was necessary to ensure that employees and distributors at all levels remained motivated and committed to the Company.
Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2016 75 ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE The Committee acknowledges the requirement set out in the Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in September 2014 the Code for companies to put in place arrangements that will enable them to recover or withhold variable remuneration when appropriate to do so.
The Committee intends to include provisions to withhold or recover such remuneration in the event of fraud or malus committed by a director in any new Share Incentive Scheme or LTIP 2016 awards.
