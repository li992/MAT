The figure for performance-related share based awards includes share price appreciation since the date the award was granted.
In the case of Erik Engstroms figures, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 4.4m for 2015 and 3.3m for 2016.
For Nick Luff, the amount included that relates to share price appreciation is 0.4m for 2015 and 1.3m for 2016.
The figures for 2015 in column e disclosed in last years Report were, as required by the UK Regulations, based on an estimate using prescribed average share prices and exchange rates and have been restated in this Report to reflect the actual amount vested and the actual share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates of the 2013-15 cycle of BIP, LTIP and ESOS and the PSP granted to Nick Luff with a performance period ended 31 December 2015.
The vesting percentages under these plans were determined on 26February 2016 and were in line with those disclosed on page 80 in the 2015 Remuneration Report.
Using the share prices and exchange rates on the vesting dates increased the 2015 disclosed figure by 547k for Erik Engstrom and by 106k for Nick Luff.
The 2016 figures reflect the vesting of the 2014-16 cycle of BIP, LTIP and ESOS.
As the BIP, LTIP and ESOS vest after the approval dateof this Report, the average share prices and exchange rates for the last quarter of 2016 have been used to arrive at anestimated figure under the UK statutory basis in respect of these awards.
The proportion of the value of Erik Engstroms share based awards under the UK statutory basis that relates to share price appreciation between the dates of grant and vesting is 56% or4.4m for 2015 reported on an estimated basis in the 2015 Remuneration Report as being 3.9m and 48% or 3.3m for 2016 using, as required, the average share prices and exchange rates for the last quarter of 2016.
2 Dutch Civil Code basis columns f and h : These figures comply with the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code.
The figures for share based awards comprise the multi-year incentive charges in accordance with IFRS2 Share based Payment.
These IFRS2 charges do not reflect the actual value received on vesting.
3 E xchange rates used for share based awards: The exchange rates used to convert share based awards to pounds sterling are i for the UK statutory basis, those that applied at the vesting dates or, if vesting has not occurred at the time of sign off of this Report, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2016: ii for dividend equivalents, the actual pounds sterling payment made: and iii for estimated dividend equivalents in respect of awards for which vesting has not occurred at the time of sign off of this Report and which are yet to be paid, the average exchange rates for the last quarter of 2016.
4 Benefits: Each Executive Director receives a car allowance, private medical dental insurance and the company meets the cost of tax return preparation.

These share prices are used to determine the number ofawards granted, as well as to set option exercise prices.
The face value of the ESOS options shown in this column has not been reduced to reflect the fact thatthe aggregate option price is payable on exercise.

The face value for Nick Luffs BIP matching award, who invested in PLC and NV ordinary shares, is calculated on the same basis as the LTIP and ESOS face values.
2 For BIP, LTIP and ESOS, vesting in line with expectations is as per the performance scenario chart disclosed on page 83 of the 2013 Remuneration Report, i. e. 67% for BIP, 50% for LTIP and 80% for ESOS.
For options vesting in line with expectations, a valuation factor of 20% of the face value of the award at grant has been applied.
3 Threshold payout levels for each measure have been included.
Where there are multiple measures, it is possible to achieve threshold, and hence payout, in respect of just one of the measures or, for TSR, in respect of one of the three TSR comparator groups.
