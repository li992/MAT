Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance 117 Annual Report on Remuneration The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the payments made and awards granted to the directors in 2016 and how the Company intends to implement the New Policy in 2017.
This, along with the Chairmans Annual Statement, is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM.
Market benchmarks In accordance with the New Policy, benchmarking will only be undertaken in relation to the base pay of the executive directors.
The primary peer group for benchmarking executive remuneration comprises large insurers and, for 2016 and 2017, included Prudential plc, Aviva plc, RSA Insurance Group plc, Legal & General Group plc, Standard Life plc, Allianz Group and Axa Group.
For non-executive directors, benchmarking is performed against non-executive directors remuneration in FTSE100 companies using the whole of the FTSE100 population as well as an extract of companies by market capitalisation.
Figures for 2015 represent remuneration paid for the period from that date 2 Paul Hanratty ceased to be an executive director of the Company on 12 March 2016.
Figures for 2016 represent remuneration paid for the period up to that date including the STI paid in relation to the period in which he was a director.
Element Description Taxable benefits These amounts represent the gross value of benefits that are paid for by the Company and are chargeable to UK income tax.
They cover such items as tax advice, spouses travel, use of a car and driver and, for Bruce Hemphill, relocation costs from South Africa to the UK.
In accordance with the approved Directors Remuneration Policy, the Company paid for certain costs of relocating, such as a settling-in allowance, relocation agents costs, moving costs, transport of household items, temporary housing and transaction costs, indirect costs of purchasing a house in the UK and cost of travel for his family.
The committee applied caps to certain elements of Bruce Hemphills relocation package to ensure that controls were in place to manage the total costs incurred.
The total value of the costs covered was 825,931 in 2015.
The Company accounted for the tax due on these costs directly, resulting in gross costs of 1, 467, 310 in 2015 and it is this value that is included in the single total figure for that year.
STI STI awarded in relation to performance in the year, including 50% that is deferred for three years in the form of a share award.
Vesting of the share awards is not subject to the achievement of performance targets but requires the director to remain in office during the vesting period.
Malus applies to the shares held under award prior to vesting and claw back applies to the cash element.
As part of Bruce Hemphills recruitment arrangements in relation to the buy-out of existing awards, he received a guaranteed STI award for 2015 to the value of 950,000, 50% of which was deferred for three years in the form of a share award.
LTI The 2015 Directors Remuneration Report reflected the value of L TI vesting based on the average Old Mutual plc share price over the final quarter of 2015 198.04p, as the options granted in 2013 had not vested at the time of publication.
The values have been updated to reflect the actual market value of 50% of the award that vested in April 2016, namely 184.8p per share, while the balance of 50% which is due to vest in April 201 7 is valued as it was in 2015.
In disclosing the value of the L TIP for Paul Hanratty in the 2015 single figure, the scorecard outcome was applied to too many shares resulting in an overstatement of value and shares vesting in 2016 of 13%.
This has been corrected in the single figure table above and the number of shares due to vest in April 201 7 from the second tranche of the 2013 L TIP award has been reduced to ensure that Paul Hanratty receives the correct number of vested shares across both tranches The 2016 L TI value has been calculated using the average Old Mutual plc share price over the final quarter of 2016 195.6p and, for the 50% of the options that are due to vest in April 201 7, the value will be restated in the 201 7 Directors Remuneration Report.
Malus and claw back apply to the shares held under option In respect of Ingrid Johnson, the L TI value for 2015 has been updated to reflect the actual market value of the awards that vested or were matched in 2016 namely R181 per share in respect of the Nedbank Restricted Share Award over 8,320 Nedbank shares, and R189.66 per share in respect of the matching award of 5,750 Nedbank shares converted to sterling using the exchange rate for each vesting date namely R21.
99 and R20.801 1 to 1 respectively In respect of Ingrid Johnson, the 2016 L TI value represents the value of her Nedbank award that is due to vest in 201 7, calculated using the average Nedbank share price over the final quarter of 2016 R226.38, converted to sterling using the average exchange rate over the final quarter of 2016 R1 7.
