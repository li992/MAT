Base salaries for executive directors as at 1 July 2016: Chief executive 495,000 Finance director 315,000 Annual bonus plan The annual bonus plan is structured as a pool funded each year as a percentage of modified profit after tax with the sharing rate dependent on performance.
Performance is based on the rate of return achieved on opening shareholder funds.
Opening shareholder funds is determined by the market value of the Group when the scheme was introduced in July 2012, inflated annually by the difference between continuing profit after tax and exceptionals for the year and dividends paid to shareholders.
The target rate of return is set at the beginning of each year by the committee.
For 2015 16 the target rate of return was set at 9%, at which point a bonus pool of 2.25% of modified profit after tax is created for the executive directors and other executive committee members.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to exclude items reported as discontinued or exceptional.
The bonus pool is allocated at the discretion of the committee with regard to individual, corporate and relative performance to peers.
2015 16 annual cash and bonus The target Group profit after tax in order to trigger creation of a bonus pool for the year was 62.1m, with the target required for maximum bonus entitlement being 125.4m.
The Group actually achieved 72.3m which resulted in the creation of a bonus pool of 1.4m for executive directors and other members of the executive committee listed on page 50. www.

Share ownership guidelines and directors interests in shares Below we set out details of the share ownership guidelines that were in operation until June 2016.
In light of the Companys free float position see page 82, these have been re-suspended until a higher free float position is achieved.
Until October 2011, independent non-executive directors were using between 30% and 40% of their base net fees after tax to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at quarterly intervals, with intention that such shares be retained throughout their tenure year ofservice.
Similarly the Group had guidelines for executive shareholdings which were set as a percentage of base salary and in respect of which executives had five years from appointment to build up.
These guidelines were as follows.
Chief executive 150% Finance director 100% Other executive committee members 50% Shareholdings of directors of the Company and its subsidiaries are not considered to be in public hands for the purposes of determining the sufficiency of the percentage of shares in public hands the free float in the context of qualification for a listing on the UKLAs premium market.
In view of the low level of free float following the completion of Guoco Group Limiteds general offer for Rank in July 2011, the non-executive director quarterly share purchase programme and the shareholding guidelines for executive directors and other members of the executive committee who are directors of Rank subsidiary companies were suspended on 14 December 2011.
The suspension was lifted on 2 March 2015 when free float was comfortably in excess of 25%, but were re-suspended again on 22 June 2016 pending a restoration of the Companys free float to a higher level.
For further information with regard to the Companys free float positions please refer to page 82.

com 77 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Dilution limits The LTIP, being the Companys only equity-based incentive plan, incorporates the current Investment Association guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10-year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital with a further limitation of 5% in any 10-year period for executive plans.
The committee regularly monitors the position and prior to the making of any award considers the effect of potential vesting of awards to ensure that the Company remains within these limits.
Any awards which are required to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from the calculations.
No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 30 June 2016.
