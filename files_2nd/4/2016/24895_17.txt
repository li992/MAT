Percentage change in remuneration non-audited The table below illustrates the percentage change in salary, benefits and annual bonus for the Chief Executive based on the single-figure table compared with that of colleagues in the broadbanded population and senior management colleagues across the Group.
Remuneration for broadbanded colleagues is not subject to union negotiations and, as for previous years, the committee believes this provides the most reasonable comparator group.
% change % change % change in base salary FY15-FY16 in benefits FY15-FY16 in annual bonus FY15-FY16 1 Chief Executive 1% increase 4% increase 4% decrease 2 All broadbanded colleagues 2% increase 20% decrease 127% decrease 3 Senior management colleagues 2% increase 34% decrease 21% decrease Notes: 1.
Figures for the Chief Executive relate to John Walden for FY16 and both Terry Duddy and John Walden for FY15.
a. John Walden received an increase of 2% to base salary during FY16.
The increase in the table above is reflective of the inclusion of base salary for Terry Duddy during his period as Chief Executive in FY15.
b. Whilst there has been a decrease in cost of some benefits, the increase shown above is due to an increase in cost of healthcare benefits in the US.
c. B onus for FY15 reflects only the 50 week period as Chief Executive for John Walden from his appointment on 14 March 2014.
Terry Duddy did not receive any bonus in respect of FY15.
Bonus payments reflect business performance as set out on page 43.
The following is relevant for the whole broadbanded population: a.
Salary increases are based on an overall pay review budget of c. 2%.
The comparison for benefits is based on data excluding Homebase.
Benefit cost decreases relate to a change in company car policy.
c. Whilst bonus structure for senior management colleagues in the broadbanded population mirrors that of the executive directors, other colleagues in the broadbanded population are bonused on benchmark PBT only and as such are not eligible for a bonus payment in respect of FY16.
The decrease in average bonus reflects the impact of this.
The following is relevant for senior management colleagues: a.
Salary and benefit changes are as all broadbanded colleagues.
The decrease in bonus is for those senior management colleagues with the same bonus structure as the executive directors.

Shareholder distributions refer to dividends paid or declared in respect of the financial year.
An interim dividend of 1.0p per ordinary share was paid on 21 January 2016.
The final dividend has 150 not been declared as a result of the 2.8p element of the proposed capital return component of the Board-recommended offer by J Sainsbury plc, which reflects a payment in lieu of the FY16 125 final dividend.
The full-year dividend is therefore represented by the interim dividend of 1.0p 100 per ordinary share.
Including this payment in lieu of the FY16 final dividend, the total charge would have been 29.9m.
