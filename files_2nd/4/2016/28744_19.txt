As shown in the table below there is strong linkage between the financial performance of the Company and the Directors incentive schemes.

The individual performance modifier is applied to the outturn of the financial element of the bonus based on an objective assessment of the Executive Directors performance against specific individual objectives set for the year.
The individual performance modifiers for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer include aspects as follows: People, Customers, Safety, Systems, Governance & Control and Key Strategic Projects, see page 77 for further details.
The inclusion of the EPS measure in the 2014 PSP award, and for all subsequent awards, whose performance period ends in the reporting year 2016, means the 2014 PSP has been included, on an estimated basis, in the single total figure table for 2016, in line with the Regulations.
Therefore the 2016 single total figure table for the Executive Directors contains both the retrospective 2013 PSP award that vested in April 2016 and the estimated, prospective 2014 PSP award that does not vest until March 2017.

In compliance with reporting regulations, as explained on page 72, the 2016 single total figure includes both the 2013 PSP awards which vested in 2016 and the 2014 PSP awards which are due to vest in March 2017 as both awards have performance periods ending in this reporting year.
By comparison, the 2015 figure only contains the value of one cycle of PSP awards granted in 2012.
The 2013 PSP grant had one performance condition of TSR over a three-year period to 29 April 2016.
The 2014 award has two performance conditions: one-third EPS measured over three financial years to 31 December 2016, which has been met and two-thirds relative TSR measured over a three-year period ending 30 March 2017, which has been recognised based on the conditions having been substantially met and no decline expected.
The actual value of the 2014 PSP will be restated next year once the final performance outcome and the share price at date of vesting are known.
For the 2014 PSP, share price at vesting was estimated as the average of the Companys share price over the last financial quarter of 2016, giving a price of 219.79p.
Full details can be found in the 2013 and 2014 awards vesting table on page 79.

Annual bonus plan 2016 bonus outcome The Committee reviewed the 2016 bonus plan outcome for the Groups senior management population based on the targets set at the start of the financial year.
The metrics and the levels of performance for the Executive Directors for the 2016 bonus plan are set out on page 77.
The table on page 73 shows the alignment between our strategy and remuneration framework.
Individual performance is accounted for using an individual performance modifier, which is linked to the Groups performance and development review process.
Further details are set out below.
Bonuses earned reflect the performance of the constituent businesses which make up the overall Group performance as well as achievement against specific personal objectives.
For any bonus to be payable to an Executive Director, two gateway conditions had to be met.
Both conditions were met as follows: Gateway condition: the Company must achieve at least 95% of a profit target of 259.35m.
Gateway condition: the Company must achieve Free Cash Flow generation of 105.0m.
As both gateway conditions were satisfied, Executive Directors bonuses were determined by Ongoing Operating Profit before restructuring costs and Ongoing Revenue performance plus an individual performance modifier.
To support the delivery of profitable growth in 2016 and beyond, and to align incentives with the Groups strategy, revenue targets for Executive Directors were weighted to focus on sectors that were critical to the business.
To provide this focus, the following co-efficients were applied to the revenue generated from the quadrants as described in the Strategic Report on page 16.

Objectives in the individual performance modifier include such areas as People, Customers, Safety, Systems, Governance & Control and Key Strategic Projects.
The maximum individual performance modifier that can be applied to the bonus is 125%.

Likewise it can have the effect of increasing vesting to a maximum of 200% if maximum bonus performance was achieved in each of the three years of the performance period and the performance measures were met in full.
Achievement against annual bonus in respect of each financial year average over performance period Below Threshold Threshold Target Maximum Individual Performance Modifier 0% 50% 100% 200% F or the 2013-2016 PSP cycle, the bonus performance across the three years was 51.3% of maximum for the Chief Executive and 49.4% of maximum for the Chief Financial Officer.
The performance modifier had the effect of reducing the maximum opportunity payout from 200% to 102.55% for the Chief Executive and 98.84% for the Chief Financial Officer.
For the 2014-2017 PSP cycle, the bonus performance across the three years was 63.3% of maximum for the Chief Executive and 59.6% of maximum for the Chief Financial Officer.
The performance modifier had the effect of reducing the maximum opportunity payout from 200% to 126.53% for the Chief Executive and 119.13% for the Chief Financial Officer.
The EPS targets for 2014 were revised upward from 14% at threshold and 20% at maximum to reflect material acquisitions and disposals.
Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 79 Directors Remuneration Report Part 2 The aggregate number of shares vesting in 2016 is summarised in the table below.
The table also includes the additional number of shares relating to dividends accrued throughout the performance period which were added to the final awards.
2013 and 2014 PSP awards vesting The table below has been audited.
An additional allocation of up to a maximum of 458,716 shares was awarded to Andy Ransom on 1 October 2013 in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for award to Chief Executives, whereby the target level of award was based on 120% of salary.
The 2013 and 2014 PSP share awards are entitled to dividend equivalent shares between date of grant and date of vest calculated on the close of business share price on the date on which the dividend was paid.
These are included in the total shares vested in 2016.
The value of the vested awards under the 2013 PSP was calculated using the closing share price at date of vesting, which on 30 April 2016 was 176.1p and on 1 October 2016 was 222.3p.
The 2013 PSP share awards are also entitled to receive additional dividend equivalent shares at exercise based upon the value of dividends paid during the period between the date of vest and the date one month before the award is exercised.
The value of these shares does not form part of the single total figure for the remuneration of Executive Directors.
Long-term incentives granted during the year On 12 May 2016, Andy Ransom and Jeremy Townsend were both granted an award of shares under the PSP worth 200% of salary.
The number of shares that vest will be two-thirds based on relative TSR performance and one-third based on an EPS performance: Relative TSR performance measure 25% of this element of the award will vest if Rentokil Initials performance at the end of the three-year performance period is positioned at median against a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index, excluding financial services, property and primary resources sectors, with full vesting for upper quartile TSR performance.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points.
EPS performance measure 25% of this element of the award will vest for EPS growth of 9% Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR over the three-year performance period with full vesting for EPS growth of 15% CAGR.
In addition, when determining the level of vesting, the Committee will also consider the underlying financial performance of the business, as well as the value added for shareholders during the performance periods, and may adjust the vesting outcome if it considers this to be appropriate.
Awards to Executive Directors under the 2016 PSP award are set out in the table below.
2016 PSP award The table below has been audited.

The figures shown for the number of share awards are maximum entitlements and the actual number of shares if any which vest will depend on the performance conditions being achieved as set out above.
Threshold minimum vesting equals 25% vesting.
No PSP shares will vest for below threshold performance.
The face value of the award is based on the closing share price of 159.4p on 10 March 2016.
This is consistent with the basis used to determine the All Employee 2016 PSP grant on 11 March 2016.
TheExecutive Directors grant was delayed until 12 May 2016 to allow for the 2016 Performance Share Plan and Remuneration Policy to be approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.

Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2016 84 Directors Remuneration Report Part 3 Directors Annual Remuneration Report Looking forward 2017 Executive Director base salaries from 1 January 2017 Executive Directors and senior executives salaries are reviewed with effect from 1 January each year in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
When reviewing salary levels, the Committee takes into account a number of internal and external factors, including Company performance during the year, external market data and the salary review principles applied to the rest of the organisation to ensure a consistent approach.
Base salaries reflect the role, individual experience, skills and contribution to overall business performance as well as external market conditions.
Following a review of the performance of the business, the economic and market considerations in the UK, where average pay increases in the Company will be in the order of 2%, the Committee agreed that the salaries of Executive Directors for 2017 should be as set out below.
Salary from 1 January 2017 Executive Director Salary Effective date Andy Ransom Chief Executive 735,564 1% increase 1 Jan 2017 Jeremy Townsend Chief Financial Officer 472,860 1% increase 1 Jan 2017 Fixed pay for 2017 will be: Pension based Base salary from Estimated on salary from 1 Jan 2017 benefits for 2017 1 Jan 2017 Total fixed pay 000 000 000 000 Andy Ransom Chief Executive 736 20 184 940 Jeremy Townsend Chief Financial Officer 473 17 71 561 2017 bonus structure Executive Directors can earn a maximum opportunity of 120% of their base salary as an annual cash bonus.
The focus of the bonus is on rewarding profitable growth in order to align Executive Directors incentives with the Groups strategy.
The Committee has approved the following structure ofbonuses for 2017 for the Executive Directors: 95% of the profit target and a free cash flow gateway of 130m have to be reached at Group level before a bonus is paid to the Executive Directors.
If both these profit and cash flow gateways are achieved then Executive Directors can earn up to100% of base salary based on a combination of revenue and profit targets.
This is split 50% profit 50% revenue for both the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer.
Revenue targets for Executive Directors will continue to be weighted to focus on the segments that will set the foundations for longer-term profitable growth.
To provide this focus the following co-efficients will be applied to revenue generated from businesses in the following quadrants, as described in the Strategic Report on page 16.
Quadrant Co-efficient 2017 Emerging 1.39 Growth 1.10 Protect & Enhance 0.60 Manage for Value 0.37 The co-efficients are applied to the total sales in each quadrant.
An individual performance modifier may also increase or decrease the opportunity arising from performance against the revenue and profit targets, as outlined below, to further recognise individual contribution to business performance.
This individual performance modifier applies to all colleagues who participate in the Group Management Bonus Scheme GMBS and is measured by the Companys performance and the development review process.
Bonus targets have not been disclosed looking forward for 2017 as the Board believes that this information is commercially sensitive.
Disclosing bonus targets could provide information about our business plans to our competitors which could be damaging to our business interests and therefore to shareholders.
However, retrospective bonus outcomes for 2016 have been disclosed in the tables on page 77, and the 2017 targets will be disclosed in next years report.
