None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest, other than as a Shareholder of the Company, or conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
In April, the Committee approved the use of nil-cost options for the share awards to the Executive Directors to bring the Group into linewith UK market practice.
Nil cost options give participants greater flexibility over when they can exercise their options and receive Informa shares: in full or part between three and ten years from the date of grant.
This change was made after receiving external advice and is in line with institutional investor proxy voting guidelines.
Allocations held under the 2014, 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards were converted to nil cost options for the Executive Directors, and allocations for Senior Management under the 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards will be converted in February 2017 for Senior Management in the UK and in other jurisdictions where local regulations allow and where there are no adverse consequences.
The Committee has approved the use of nil cost options for all future LTIP awards to Executive Directors and Senior Management in the UK and other jurisdictions as appropriate, including awards made in 2017.

A review of our remuneration advisers, Willis Towers Watson WTW was initiated in 2016, following the review of our external auditors last year.

2017 DEVELOPMENTS The base pay of the Executive Directors will increase by 1%, as will the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors fees.
This compares to an average increase of 2.1% for our colleagues.
Additional investment is being made into the Companys share incentive plan ShareMatch for colleagues.
Starting from the 2017 planyear in April, the Group will now contribute one share for every one share purchased by a colleague, rather than one for every twoshares.
The aim is to encourage more colleagues to participate in the Group as Shareholders and to align their interests with external Shareholders.
The Group has an ambition that 33% of eligible colleagues participate in the plan by 2020.
The plan is being opened to Colleagues newly joined from Penton on an equal basis at the same time.
Further details are contained in the Report on page 99.

If Informa ranks at median, 20% of the award subject to this measure will vest.
This increases on a straight line basis, where full vesting is achieved if the Group ranks at orabove the 80th percentile.

In setting the 2017 EPS CAGR targets, the Committee took into account internal and external projections for the EPS CAGR at the time of grant.
Threshold performance 2% would result in the vesting of 20% of the EPS CAGR award: on target performance 4% would result in 50% of the EPS award vesting: and at the maximum 6% or above, 100% of the EPS award would vest, with a linear progression between those points.
The Committee will disclose details of its assessment of performance following the conclusion of the performance period.
SHAREMATCH The Company launched ShareMatch in 2014, a global share incentive plan which qualifies for certain tax benefits in the UK, through which virtually all Informa colleagues are able to invest up to 1,800 per annum in the Companys shares either via monthly contributions or a one-off lump sum.
The plan includes a matching element, whereby for every two shares purchased, the Company gives colleagues one matching share, subject to a holding period of three years.
Participation in 2016 reached more than 970 colleagues across the world.
Building on thismomentum, the Company intends to increase its commitment further in 2017 by improving the matching element to one-for-one, further rewarding colleagues who participate in the Group as equity Shareholders.
Both Stephen A. Carter and Gareth Wright, as well as all of the Executive Management Team, are members of ShareMatch.
Matching shares are subject to forfeiture if the purchased shares are withdrawn from the plan within three years of purchase.
Both the purchased and matching shares are eligible to receive dividends payable by the Company, which are automatically reinvested in more shares known as Dividend Shares, further increasing the attractiveness of the plan to colleagues.
As explained on page 5, the addition of Penton Information Services was partially funded by a fully underwritten rights issue.
The trustee of ShareMatch, in accordance with the terms of the plan, automatically participated in the rights issue on behalf of participants by selling the minimum amount of rights so that the proceeds could be used to take up the remaining rights known as cashless take up or tail swallowing.
Participants could, therefore, participate in the rights issue without having to make any extra financial contribution.
For global ShareMatch where cashless take up is not possible for the matching shares, the relevant matching awards were adjusted so that participants did not lose out due to the fact they could not take part in the rights issue.
The take up of rights by both Stephen A. Carter and Gareth Wright is noted on page 103.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE No payments for loss of office were made during the year ended 31 December 2016.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS The only payments made to past Directors during the year ended 31 December 2016 were under the Companys pension schemes.

The following information has not been subject to audit.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2017 In 2017 the base pay of the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Chairman and Non-Executive Directors was increased by 1.0% with effect from 1 January.
In determining those pay rises, the pay rises for colleagues averaging 2.1% and other factors were taken into consideration.
As is highlighted on page 5 of the Chairmans Introduction, the Group will in 2017 change the way it measures growth from organic tounderlying revenue growth, a more widely recognised measure.
Consequently, the Committee will revise the ORG performance measure for the annual bonus to be Underlying Revenue Growth URG for the 2017 bonus.
As in 2016, both Executive Directors may earn a maximum bonus equivalent to 150% of base salary, with the maximum award for EPS performance being 120% of base salary and the maximum award for URG being 30%.
Performance below 95% of the EPS target will result in no EPS-related bonus.
On target performance will result in a bonus equivalent to 90% of salary.
A below-threshold performance for URG will result in no URG-related bonus.
An on-target performance will result in a 10% URG-related bonus.
The 2017 LTIP awards follow the same structure as the 2016 awards.
The initial award is equivalent to 200% of the Group Chief Executives base salary and 150% of the Group Finance Directors base salary.
The same performance measures will apply, namely relative TSR relative to the FTSE 51 150 companies excluding financial services and natural resources companies and EPS CAGR, with equal weighting to both, together with the same performance ranges.
The performance ranges were determined after the Committee took into account a variety of factors, including the internal and external projections for the Groups performance.
100 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2016 www.
com STRATEGIC FINANCIAL REPORT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS The use of the annual bonus measures and the EPS CAGR measure provides a clear line of sight to the priorities set out in the GrowthAcceleration Plan see page 11 and aligns incentive awards with success in delivering against the Plan.
These measures seekto balance sustainable and efficient revenue growth, while continuing to deliver against EPS expectations and driving long-term Shareholder value.
The Committee will set appropriately stretching targets for each performance cycle, taking into account factors including the internal goals, analyst expectations, cost of capital and peer performance.
HISTORICAL TSR AND GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY The graphs below illustrate the Groups TSR performance compared with the performance of the FTSE All-Share Media Index, the FTSE 350 Index excluding Investment Trusts and the FTSE 51-150 Peer Group excluding financial services and natural resources, inthe eight-year period ended 31 December 2016.
These indices and peer group have been selected for this comparison because theCompany is a constituent company of all three and performance relative to the FTSE All Share Media and FTSE 350 indices informs vesting or partial vesting under the 2014 LTIP award.
Historical TSR performance Growth in the value of a hypothetical 100 holding invested in Informa over eight years.
