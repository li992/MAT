Annual bonuses Each year, the Remuneration Committee reviews the annual bonus, to ensure the performance measures and targets remain appropriate and aligned with the Companys short-term strategy, while remaining within the appropriate risk profile.
Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2017, Paul Forman is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 150% of basic salary and Stefan Schellinger is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 125% of basic salary.
It is an important principle of Essentras pay philosophy that the structure of pay should complement and support business strategy.
Following consultation with the Board, the Remuneration Committee has agreed performance measures for 2017 incentives that are consistent with the Company's priorities.

COM Performance criteria Weighting % Adjusted operating profit 25.0 Adjusted net income 25.0 30.0 Net working capital 20.0 Personal objectives The Remuneration Committee believes that adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income and net working capital targets are commercially sensitive, and will not disclose the targets on a prospective basis.
The targets and actual performance against them will be disclosed on a retrospective basis where possible.
In addition to the financial measures, the Remuneration Committee has also set the personal performance measures for Paul Forman and Stefan Schellinger which are designed to deliver further progress by the Company towards its strategic objectives.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion, within a three-year period after the determination of the bonus, to withhold or recover annual cash bonuses or DASB awards through malus and clawback provisions in specified circumstances.
These circumstances take into account where the original bonus was paid to a greater extent than it should have done, due to a material misstatement in the Companys Financial Statements or due to an error in assessing the applicable performance conditions or if there has been serious misconduct by an individual or if there has been serious reputational damage to the Company or a relevant business unit.
