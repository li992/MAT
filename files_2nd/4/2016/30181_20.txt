com 58 Governance report Report on Directors Remuneration continued Transformation Long Term Incentive Plan This is a one-off long-term plan aligned to the three-year integration period for Tullett Prebon and ICAP January 2017 December 2019.
We have designed the LTIP to reward Executive Directors and the GEC for the value created from the acquisition, and to incentivise and retain them over the period of intense activity required to achieve the stated objectives.
There would be no further awards under the existing LTIS over this period.
We gave very careful consideration to the merit of awarding LTIPs annually, as is the more common practice elsewhere.
However, while an award in 2017 would align with the three-year integration period, awards in subsequent years would result in performance periods extending beyond 2019, which the Board believes would reduce the focus on the unique opportunity available to the Company.
We recognise that some of our shareholders prefer rolling long-term incentive awards.
However, the Boards view, and that of our leading shareholders, is that the proposed Remuneration Policy provides the best means of focusing our Executive Directors and GEC on achieving the targets of the three-year integration plan.
Retaining and motivating our senior team is essential if we are to reach this goal.
The proposed LTIP provides a maximum pool of 60m.
This pool will be allocated between the Executive Directors and the wider GEC 59% of the pool is reserved for the GEC while the Chief Executive will receive a 25% share maximum pay-out 15m and the CFO will receive a share of 16% maximum pay-out 9.6m.
As explained earlier, it should be noted that the annual target bonus potential for both the Chief Executive and the CFO will be substantially lower under the new Policy than in previous years.
At the end of the performance period, the LTIP pool will be determined based on the absolute TSR and EPS performance described below and converted into awards of shares.
Shares will be subject to a holding period and will be released 1 3 in April 2021, 1 3 in April 2022 and 1 3 in April 2023.
During the holding period, the shares cannot be sold other than to cover the cost of any applicable taxes.
LTIP performance measures Under the proposed LTIP, there are two performance elements which will determine the ultimate vesting under the plan: 75% of the weighting will be absolute TSR and the remaining 25% will be EPS.
Incorporating two measures into the LTIP reflects the overall view of shareholders as shared during the consultation process.
The proposed performance targets are shown below.
We have also shown the estimated total cost synergies required to achieve these targets, assuming a broadly constant share-price earnings multiple.
This compares with the target of 60m published in our prospectus and 80m over three years and 100m over four years as stretching targets outlined on page 5.
It is clear that these are very demanding targets indeed, and offers further demonstration of the Committee`s choice of a one-off three-year LTIP to focus management performance on these targets.

3 Based on financial modelling which looks at the impact of multiple inputs.
4 Underlying Tullett Prebon EPS in 2016.
5 Cost synergy target published in prospectus dated 1 March 2016.
We have chosen absolute TSR as the primary measure for a number of reasons.
It is clear and understandable by the wider management team, and correlates directly with the value created for shareholders.
We concluded that relative TSR, while preferred by some shareholders, was less appropriate, as our two principal competitors, BGC Partners Inc. and Compagnie Financiare Tradition, do not have shares that are fully distributed.
Relative TSR would therefore need to be measured relative to an index or a broader financial services comparator group.
The Committee felt that this would considerably reduce the clarity of the scheme for management.
The threshold performance level of 8% reflects the wishes of our leading shareholders.
This is also consistent with our TSR CAGR over the six years to 31 December 2016 of 8%.
With respect to the 2019 EPS targets, it should be noted that the prospectus stated that the ICAP acquisition is expected to dilute Tullett Prebons EPS in the first year, that the delivery of cost synergies and additional efficiencies in the second year is expected to at least offset that dilution, and the acquisition is expected to result in EPS accretion on a fully-phased basis.

Executive Base salary John Phizackerley 550,000 Andrew Baddeley 400,000 Paul Mainwaring 350,000 Annual bonus The Remuneration Committee determined that the Bonus Pool Operating Profit for 2016 should amount to 121.05m.
The Remuneration Policy requires that for any bonus to be awarded to the Executive Directors, operating profit must exceed a threshold calculated as the weighted average cost of capital times the average capital employed.
The Committee determined that the Bonus Pool Operating Profit had exceeded this threshold.
Bonus Pool Operating Profit The maximum Bonus Pool Operating Profit is capped at 150% of the prior year Bonus Pool Operating Profit of 80.7m.
The cap means that the 2016 Bonus Pool Operating Profit is restricted to 121.05m.
Without the application of this cap, the Bonus Pool Operating Profit would have been 124.3m.
This is based on reported operating profit of 73.3m adding back the acquisition and integration costs relating to the ICAP acquisition, the PVM acquisition related share-based payment charge and other PVM acquisition related items, less the net settlement gain relating to the bulk transfer exercise offered to deferred members of the Tullett Prebon defined benefit pension scheme.

In determining annual bonus awards, the Committee also confirmed, in consultation with the Board Risk Committee, that the Company and individual Executives had operated within agreed risk controls and regulatory compliance requirements.
50% of the 2016 bonus net of tax has to be invested in the Companys ordinary shares to be held for three years and will be subject during this time to claw-back as described in the Directors Remuneration Policy.
The reinvestment requirement does not have any service or other non-performance conditions attached to it.

Following consultations with shareholders and their agents, it was concluded that the 15.9% vote against was as a consequence of the structure of our 2014 Policy.
Market practices have changed since shareholders approved this Policy.
However, the Committee is bound to operate within the Policy until shareholders approve a new one.
In developing our new Policy, to be put to shareholders for approval at our 2017 AGM, the Committee has taken account of the comments received following the 2016 AGM.
For 2016, the Remuneration Committee undertook a comprehensive performance assessment in the awarding of bonuses for our Executive Directors in accordance with our Policy and commitments.
2017 AGM Copies of the Executive Directors service agreements, the Non-executive Directors letters of appointment are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours and will be available for shareholders to view at the 2017 AGM.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017 In 2017 we will implement a new Remuneration Policy for our Executive Directors.
Under the new Policy we will again set individual performance targets which will be disclosed retrospectively.
The policies set out in the Policy table in the Remuneration Policy section of the Report on Directors Remuneration will apply in 2017 subject to a binding vote at the 2017 AGM in May 2017.
Specifically in connection with the Transformation LTIP, if an Executive Director is appointed to the Board during the Transformation LTIP performance period, the Committee may, at its sole discretion, taking into account the portion of the performance period which has lapsed allow the newly appointed Executive Director to participate in the LTIP on a time apportioned basis.
The maximum total pool would remain unchanged.
Alternatively the Executive Director may be granted a conventional Performance Share Plan award PSP.
If a PSP award is made in lieu of participation in the Transformation LTIP, the maximum aggregate variable pay, including annual bonus and PSP, would be 500% of base salary or 600% in exceptional circumstances, of which a maximum of 250% or 300% in exceptional circumstances of base salary may be in the form of annual bonus.
These limits exclude any awards that are required to replace deferred remuneration from a previous employer that is forfeited on joining.
The final determination will be at the discretion of the Committee.
TP ICAP Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 71 Directors Remuneration Policy The new Directors Remuneration Policy will be proposed to shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
The Remuneration Policy table applicable to 2016 can be found in previous copies of the Annual Report.
Background In reviewing and approving the general principles of the Companys Remuneration Policy which applies throughout the Group, the Remuneration Committee took account of the Companys goal to become the worlds most trusted source of liquidity in hybrid OTC markets and the best operator in global hybrid voice broking.
The Remuneration Committee was mindful that the Groups strategy to achieve that objective is to continue to develop its business, operating as an intermediary in the worlds major wholesale OTC and exchange traded financial and commodity markets, with the scale and breadth to deliver superior performance and returns, underpinned by strong financial management disciplines and without actively taking credit and market risk.
The Remuneration Committee took into account general practices in the parts of the financial services sector in which the Company operates, and in particular those of the Companys competitors which include BGC Partners Inc. and Compagnie Financire Tradition.
Thesepractices are characterised by high levels of variable remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders to pay remuneration in line with market practice in the sectors in which the Company operates.
The Companys Remuneration Policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain employees with the necessary skills and experience to deliver the strategy, in order to achieve the Groups objectives.
Risk The Remuneration Committee considered the relationship between incentives and risk when approving the Remuneration Policy which will apply throughout the Group.
Details of the Groups key risks and risk management are set out in the Strategic Report of this Annual Report on pages 32 to 37.
The majority of transactions are brokered on a Name Passing basis where the business is not a counterparty to a trade.
Commissions earned on these activities are received monthly in cash.
The business does not take any trading risk and does not hold principal trading positions.
The business only holds financial instruments for identified buyers and sellers in matching trades which are generally settled within one to three days.
The business does not retain any contingent market risk and is not exposed to any material counterparty credit risk.
The business does not have valuation issues in measuring its profits.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that the Companys Remuneration Policy reflects the risk profile of the Group, is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management, and does not encourage risk taking.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the Companys Remuneration Policy is consistent with the measures set out in the businesss compliance manuals relating to conflicts of interest.
The Companys policy is to ensure that variable remuneration is not paid through vehicles or methods that facilitate avoidance of the Remuneration Code.
