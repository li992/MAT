DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Dear Shareholder, In spite of a difficult year in which the Company failed to reach its published stretch targets it remains committed to a transparent Executive remuneration policy under which Executive Directors remuneration is aligned with the interests of shareholders.
In that regard, the Committee and the Executive Directors have taken the action summarised below in relation to remuneration.
Basic salaries Reflecting the Company philosophy that Executive remuneration should be simple, transparent and directly support the delivery of the business strategy, high performance and shareholder return, we have maintained our approach of setting the Executive Directors basic salaries at a level well below the lower quartile of a business of the size and complexity of the Group.
The salary of Dave Forsey has remained at the level of 150,000 since 2002 and again will not increase in FY17.
Matt Pearsons basic salary was increased from 60,000 to 80,000 with effect from 4 June 2015 reflecting his role as an acting Board member.
While there is no current intention to increase his salary from this level in FY17, the Committee reserves the discretion to continue to review the situation.
Any increase would not be to more than 150,000 per annum.
Incentive Remuneration In accordance with our shareholder approved directors remuneration policy, the Executive Directors are not eligible to receive an annual bonus.
Rather, to drive sustained long-term business performance, instead of granting smaller awards on an annual basis, larger upfront awards are granted which only vest if significant and consistent growth is delivered year on year.
Annual published performance targets which must be hit ensure a focus is maintained on a consistent and long term profitable growth strategy.
Because the Executive Directors remuneration opportunity is very highly weighted towards performance-related remuneration which will not vest if stretching performance targets aligned with the business strategy are not met, they very much share risk with the shareholders.
In the FY15 directors remuneration report, we reported that all the performance conditions for Dave Forseys award over 1m shares granted in August 2011 under the Executive Share Scheme had been met, and the value of those shares was included in the single figure table for FY15.
Vesting of those shares was deferred until 2017.
On 6 June 2016 the Company and the Committee were informed of the decision of Dave Forsey to forego the vesting of these shares.
At the time of the announcement this represented a value of approximately 3.6m.
The Committee believe that this is very much reflective of the Executive Directors sharing risk with shareholders and taking responsibility for results that fell short of their expectation.
56 The 2015 Share Scheme which was approved by shareholders on 2 July 2014 has lapsed given the failure to reach the FY16 Adjusted Underlying EBITDA target of 420m.
The Remuneration Committee has taken the decision not to amend the targets and there is no immediate intention to present to shareholders a new scheme for Executive Directors at this time.
The Committee would point out that this is with the positive acceptance of the Executive Directors.
The Committee also does not propose to apply its discretion as per the Companys Remuneration Policy to grant further awards under the 2010 Executive Share Scheme in FY17 if the 2015 Share Scheme is not in place.
Neither will it exercise its discretion to introduce an annual bonus or provide any additional benefits to Executive Directors for FY17.
The Executive Directors focus in FY17 will be on improving shareholder value and the earnings potential of our people for their commitment and performance.
To date Mike Ashley, Executive Deputy Chairman, has not received any remuneration from the Company since before the public offering in February 2007, nor has he participated in the Executive Share Scheme.
Despite being eligible to participate in the 2015 Share Scheme, following discussions with the Committee Mike Ashley informed the Company and the Committee that he did not wish to participate in the scheme, nor did he expect any share based incentive scheme to be proposed to shareholders in relation to his role as an Executive Director while the 2015 Share Scheme was in place.
There is no current intention to offer remuneration to Mike Ashley.
During 2013 14 the Remuneration Committee re-assessed the shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors and determined that the Executive Directors must now hold a minimum shareholding of 50,000 while they remain employed by the Company.
As noted on page 60 Dave Forseys shareholding on 24 April 2016 meant that he satisfied the guideline.
As an acting Board member Matt Pearson is not currently required to satisfy the shareholding guideline.
If his appointment is made permanent, Matt Pearson would be expected to acquire the minimum number of shares over a reasonable time period determined by the Committee The Remuneration Committee is committed to further building an open and transparent engagement with our investors and employees.
We believe that a key objective of the Directors Remuneration Report is to communicate clearly and very simply how much our Executive Directors are earning, how this is very clearly linked to the performance of the Company and is of benefit to our shareholders.
Dave Singleton Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 7 July 2016 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys Directors Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM on 9 September 2015.
The full Remuneration Policy as approved by shareholders can be found on pages 45 49 of the 2015 Annual Report, a copy of which can be found on the Groups corporate website at www.
The Policy is determined by the Committee.
For ease of reference, we have set out below the Future Policy Table for Executive Directors as included in the approved Remuneration Policy, except that: 1 to reflect that the 2015 Share Scheme has lapsed, we have removed references to it: and 2 we have made consequential amendments to the text of other parts of the table to reflect the lapse of the 2015 Share Scheme and to update specific date references.
FUTURE POLICY TABLE The table below describes each of the elements of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors.
ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION: BASE SALARY PURPOSE LINK TO STRATEGY: Fixed element of the remuneration package, where the balance of fixed and variable remuneration is aligned to the commercial strategy of long-term profitable growth and reflects the Company remuneration philosophy of gearing reward to performance with a sharing of risk between Executive Directors and shareholders.
OPERATION: Base salaries are normally reviewed annually.
Mike Ashley does not currently receive a salary for his role.
MAXIMUM: Although salaries for Executive Directors other than Mike Ashley, who does not currently receive a salary and Matt Pearson who has been appointed as an acting Board member have been set at 150,000 since 2002, the Company retains discretion to set salaries at a level commensurate with other companies of a similar size and complexity as the Company.
Matt Pearsons salary will be reviewed during FY17 to take account of his role as an acting Board member or if his appointment becomes permanent but would not exceed 150,000.
Salaries for new Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Committees approach to recruitment remuneration, as described on pages 47 48 of the 2015 Annual Report.
ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION: BENEFITS 57 PURPOSE LINK TO STRATEGY: Not applicable for current Executive Directors.

There is currently no intention to change this while the Executive Share Scheme remains in place.
Benefits may be provided in line with market practice to recruit a new Executive Director taking into account individual circumstances.
Such benefits may include relocation expenses.
MAXIMUM: Whilst the Remuneration Committee has not set an absolute maximum level of benefits Executive Directors may receive, the Company retains discretion to set benefits at a level which the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate against the market and to support the ongoing strategy of the Company.
ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION: RETIREMENT BENEFITS PURPOSE LINK TO STRATEGY: Provide post-employment benefits to recruit and retain individuals of the calibre required for the business.
OPERATION: The Executive Directors are entitled to participate in a stakeholder pension scheme on the same basis as other employees.

ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION: ANNUAL BONUS PURPOSE LINK TO STRATEGY: Not applicable as Executive Directors do not participate in an annual bonus scheme.
OPERATION: The Committee has determined that no annual bonus scheme will be operated for Executive Directors while the 2015 Share Scheme is in place.
Although the 2015 Share Scheme has lapsed, the Committee does not propose to introduce an annual bonus for FY17.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued MAXIMUM: Although the 2015 Share Scheme has lapsed, the Committee does not propose to introduce an annual bonus for FY17.
The Committee may award an annual bonus opportunity of up to 200% of base salary in respect of any future year but will not award such a bonus opportunity and also grant an award under the Executive Share Scheme as referred to below.
The annual bonus opportunity for any newly recruited Executive Director will be set in accordance with the Committees approach to recruitment remuneration as described on pages 47 48 of the 2015 Annual Report.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Not applicable for so long as Executive Directors do not participate in an annual bonus scheme.
If an Executive Director does participate in an annual bonus scheme, performance will be assessed against one or more metrics determined by the Committee and linked to the Companys strategy, with the weighting between the metrics determined by the Committee.
Bonuses will be determined between 0% and 100% of the maximum opportunity based on the Committees assessment of the applicable metrics.
ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION: LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PAY EXECUTIVE SHARE SCHEME PURPOSE LINK TO STRATEGY: To recognise and reward outstanding performance of the Executives and to drive underlying Group EBITDA in line with Group strategy and align Executive Directors interests with the interests of shareholders in bringing consistent long-term profitable growth to the Company.

The Committee may grant further awards under this Scheme taking into account that the 2015 Share Scheme has lapsed, but does not propose to do so in FY17.
Mike Ashley is not eligible to be granted awards under the Executive Share Scheme.
Any award granted under the Executive Share Scheme would be subject to malus and clawback provisions on a comparable basis to those applying under the 2015 Share Scheme.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Stretching performance targets are set reflecting the business priorities that underpin Group strategy.
Any award granted under the Executive Share Scheme would be subject to stretching performance targets determined by the Committee based on Adjusted Underlying EBITDA, which would be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report following the grant of any such award.
