The full Directors' Remuneration Policy, approved for three years from the 2016 AGM held on 9 June 2016, is shown on pages 52 to 56 for ease of reference.
Please note that the information shown has been updated to take account of the fact that the policy is now approved and enacted rather than proposed.
Overview of Remuneration Policy The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives of the Group.
The table on pages 52 and 53 summarises the main components of Dignity's ongoing remuneration policy.
Details of how the Committee will implement the policy are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 56.

This resulted in the following required holdings or Ordinary Shares: Mike McCollum 43,709 Ordinary Shares.
Until the guideline is met, the executive is required to retain 50 per cent of shares acquired under the Companys share plans after allowing for tax and national insurance liabilities.
Recovery and withholding provisions apply to variable pay, to enable the Company to recover amounts paid under the annual bonus and LTIP in the event of a restatement of the accounts or an error in calculation leading to an over-payment.
Payments may be recovered for up to two years after payment vesting or two external audit cycles.
The amount to be recovered would generally be the excess payment over the amount which would otherwise be paid, and recovery may be satisfied in a variety of ways, including through the reduction of outstanding deferred awards, reduction of the next bonus or LTIP vesting and seeking a cash repayment.
Annual bonus metrics will be determined at the start of each year, based on the Group's priorities for the coming year.
Measures may include profit such as operating profit, PBT or EPS which is one of the key financial measures of growth.
LTIP performance metrics will be determined at the time of grant and based on the Group's long-term strategy.
Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver of shareholder value.
The Committee is made aware of pay structures across the wider Group when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.
An annual bonus plan operates across all employees in the Group and all permanent employees are eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme.
Overall, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees.
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the Executive Directors given it is the Executive Directors who are considered to have the greatest potential to influence Group value creation.

A copy of the LTIP rules is available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans.
These include but are not limited to the following albeit with the level of award restricted as set out in the policy table on page 53 : Who participates in the plans: The timing of grant of award and or payment: The size of an award and or a payment: Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment chosen: Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends : and The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose whilst being no less stretching.
Legacy arrangements For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy Report, authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed previously to shareholders.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors The Company's policy results in a significant portion of remuneration received by Executive Directors being dependent on Company performance.
The graph below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the Executive Directors for 2017 vary under three performance scenarios: minimum, on-target and maximum.
On-target comprises fixed pay and assumes a bonus of 70 per cent of salary is paid and 50 per cent of the LTIP vests.
Maximum comprises fixed pay and assumes full bonus payment and LTIP vesting.
No account has been taken of any changes in the Company's share price since the end of the period.
Recruitment and Promotion policy The remuneration package for a new director will be established in accordance with the Company's approved policy subject to such modifications as are set out below.
Salary levels for Executive Directors will be set in accordance with the Company's remuneration policy, taking into account the experience and calibre of the individual and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years subject to individual performance and development in the role.
Benefits will generally be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation or other expenses provided for if necessary.
A pension contribution or cash in lieu of up to 15 per cent of salary may be provided.

The maximum variable pay opportunity will be as set out in the remuneration policy table, being 150 per cent of salary under the annual bonus plan and awards with a face value of 150 per cent of salary under the LTIP.
Different performance measures may be set initially for the annual bonus in the year of joining, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual, and the point in the financial year that he or she joined the Board.
In the case of external recruitment, if it is necessary to buy out incentive pay or benefit arrangements which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer, this may be provided, taking into account the form cash or shares, timing and expected value i. e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria of the remuneration being forfeited.
Replacement share awards, if used, may be granted using the Company's existing share plans to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes if necessary and as permitted under the LSE Listing Rules.
The aim of any such award would be to ensure that as far as possible, the expected value and structure of the award will be no more generous than the amount forfeited.
In the case of an internal recruitment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its terms of grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive director will be set in line with the approved policy.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office The Company's policy is to have service contracts for Executive Directors that continue indefinitely unless determined by their notice period.
Under the Executive Directors' service contracts and in line with the policy for new appointments, 12 months' notice of termination of employment is required by either party.
Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
All Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of two years, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.
Appointments may be terminated with three months' notice.
The appointment letters for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than accrued fees and expenses.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting each year.
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.
Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with Non-Executive Directors are as follows: Unexpired term of contract or letter of appointment Name Contract date Notice period at period end Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract Peter Hindley 7 December 2016 3 months 36 months David Blackwood 1 October 2015 3 months 12 months Alan McWalter 1 January 2015 3 months 12 months Jane Ashcroft 1 April 2016 3 months 15 months Mary McNamara 1 March 2017 3 months n a Martin Pexton served on the Board throughout 2016 and resigned on 3 February 2017.
For Executive Directors, the Company may in its absolute discretion at any time after notice is served by either party, terminate a Directors contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary for the then unexpired period of notice plus the fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax.
An Executive Director's service contract may be terminated without notice for certain events such as gross misconduct or a serious breach of contract.
No payment or compensation beyond salary and the value of holiday entitlement accrued up to the date of termination will be made if such an event occurs.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Any statutory payments required by law may be made.
The Group allows Executive Directors to hold a Non-Executive position with one other company or organisation, for which they can retain the fees earned.
Mike McCollum was appointed a non-executive director of CVS Group plc on 2 April 2013 and received remuneration of 43,000 per annum including an allowance for his role as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

Should the Committee decide to make a payment in such circumstances, the rationale would be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The treatment of share-based incentives previously granted to an Executive Director will be determined based on the plan rules.
The default treatment will be for outstanding awards to lapse on cessation of employment.
However, an executive will be treated as a 'good leaver' under certain circumstances such as death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, their employing company ceasing to be a Group company or the undertaking business or division for which he or she works being sold out of the Company's group, or any other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, if treated as a good leaver, awards will normally vest on the original vesting date and will not normally be subject to a pro rata reduction unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Under the LTIP, if treated as a good leaver, awards will vest at the normal vesting date subject to the extent to which performance targets have been achieved.
The number of LTIP awards that would vest will be reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three year period actually served.
How shareholder views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee is committed to ensuring an open dialogue with our shareholders and therefore, where changes are being made to the remuneration policy or where there is a material change in which we operate our policy, we will consult with major shareholders in advance.
The Remuneration Committee adopted such an approach in putting together this revised policy by consulting the Company's largest shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies beforehand.
In addition, the Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Company does not actively consult with employees on Directors' remuneration.
However, when setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other employees in the Group.
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION The Annual Report on Remuneration set out below and the Chairman's Annual Statement will be put to a single advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM.
The information below includes how we intend to operate our policy in 2017 and the pay outcomes in respect of the 2016 financial year.
The information from the single total remunerations figures for Directors on page 58 to the end of the section on loss of office payments on page 61 has been audited.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017 Salaries Following a Group-wide review of base salaries it was determined that all full-time employees shall receive an increase of 1,200 in 2017.
Part time employees will receive a pro rata increase.
The Committee decided, following a recommendation from the Chief Executive, that the Executive Directors shall receive the same increase as all other employees.

The fees for 2017 are as detailed below and have been increased by two per cent from those in 2016: 2017 2016 Increase % Peter Hindley 173,350 169,950 2 Jane Ashcroft 46,850 45,900 2 David Blackwood 56,200 55,100 2 Alan McWalter 62,850 61,600 2 Mary McNamara 39,042 Mary McNamara was appointed on the 1 March 2017.
The base fees for Non-Executive Directors in 2017 are 46,850.
The Senior Independent Director receives an additional fee of 9,700 and the Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committees receive additional fees of 9,350 and 6,300 respectively.
Pension and Benefits All Executive Directors will receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 15 per cent of their basic salary.
Benefits will be provided in line with the approved remuneration policy.
Annual bonus For 2017, the maximum bonus potential shall be 135 per cent for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent for the remaining Executive Directors.
The annual bonus will continue to be solely based on stretching underlying EBIT targets which the Committee believes provides a sound measure of trading performance and a good balance with EPS and TSR which are used in the LTIP.
As in previous years, nothing will be payable for performance below a target level of performance, up to 70 per cent of salary is payable for achieving the target and full bonus 135 per cent of salary for the CEO and 125 per cent of salary for the other Executive Directors for achieving a second, more demanding, target.
The bonus is payable on a pro rata basis for performance between the first and second targets.
The EBIT targets themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and have not been disclosed prospectively.
However, full retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year's remuneration report.
Any bonus payable in excess of 100 per cent of salary will be deferred in shares.
The deferred shares will vest after two years subject to continued employment.
Long-term incentives The intention is to make awards under the LTIP to Executive Directors with a face value of up to 150 per cent of salary.
Half of the 2017 awards will be subject to a relative TSR measure measured against the constituents of the FTSE 350 and the other half subject to challenging EPS growth targets.
The performance period for both tranches will be the three financial years, 2016-2018.
Threshold Target Maximun Performance conditions Weighting vesting Threshold vesting Target vesting Maximum Relative TSR 50% 25% Median 100% Upper quartile or higher EPS 50% 15% 136.8p 50% 144.0p 100% 154.8p or higher No vesting may occur under the relative TSR measure unless the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
Under the EPS measure, vesting for performance between threshold and target and between target and maximum is determined on a straight line basis.
Under the TSR measure vesting between threshold and maximum is determined on a straight line basis.
Awards will be subject to a post-vesting holding period of two years.

b The pension benefit is set at 15 per cent of basic salary.
In 2015 only Mike McCollum and Richard Portman received this benefit.
Under the revised remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM it now applies to all Executive Directors.
c The bonus refers to performance in the 2015 and 2016 financial years.
The cash element, being 100 per cent of basic salary, of the bonus awarded for performance relating to 2016 is due to be paid at the end of March 2017.
The remainder of the bonus: 35 per cent of basic salary in respect of Mike McCollum and 25 per cent of basic salary for the remaining Executive Directors is deferred shares which have to be held for two years.
d The LTIP value relates to the award that was granted 24 March 2014.
The performance period for this award ends on 30 December 2016.
The value shown is calculated by reference to the average share price in the last quarter of the 2016 financial year.
The comparative number is the value of the 2013 LTIP that vested in 2016. e David Blackwood was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2015. f The other remuneration represents the gain on exercise and disposal of SAYE options granted in 2013.
Determination of 2016 annual bonus outcome The targets for the 2016 annual bonus were based on the achievement of an underlying EBIT target: Target Stretch for which 70% of for which 100% of Bonus payable Weighting maximum payable maximum payable 2016 achieved out of maximum % m m m % EBIT 100 96.7 99.1 101.7 100 The strong performance of the Group during 2016 meant that the EBIT target of 96.7 million was exceeded by 5 million 5.2 per cent.
As a consequence both the target and stretch targets for EBIT were met.
Accordingly, the Committee awarded Executive Directors full bonuses in respect of the 2016 financial year, being 135 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and 125 per cent of base salary for the other Executive Directors.

TSR No part of this award vests if performance is below median, 25 per cent vests for achieving median, with 100 per cent vesting for upper quartile performance with straight line vesting in between.
For this part of the award, no vesting can occur unless the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory.
EPS No part of this award vests if underlying EPS in 2018 is lower than 128.1 pence, 15 per cent vests for EPS of 128.1 pence, 50 per cent vests for EPS of 134.8 pence with 100 per cent vesting for EPS of 144.9 pence.
Vesting is on a straight line basis for performance in between these points.
