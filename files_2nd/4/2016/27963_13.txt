PayPoint plc Annual Report 2016 47 Variable Remuneration report continued Notes to the policy table Payments from previous awards The Company will honour any commitments entered into prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy as detailed in this report, and executive directors will be eligible to receive payment from any historical awards made.
This includes outstanding awards made under the 2009 LTIP and 2009 DSB Plan, as detailed in the annual report on remuneration.
The differences between the 2009 LTIP and DSB and the plans in the policy table are detailed below and in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
In 2014, the Remuneration Committee undertook a comprehensive review of executive incentive arrangements to simplify the long-term incentive structure and align it with the business strategy, to motivate senior management to maximise economic value for shareholders and to improve compliance with new regulatory and governance requirements.
As a result of the review, the following changes were made to the 2009 LTIP and DSB plans: The pay-out at threshold in the annual bonus was reduced from 70% to 25% of maximum to be in line with best practice.
The matching plan was removed, and a small offsetting increase made to the annual bonus and LTIP opportunities so that the fair value of long-term incentive awards would be broadly maintained.
The requirement to mandatorily defer 25% of the bonus into shares was maintained but deferred shares were made subject to continued employment and clawback.
Under the LTIP, the level of vesting at threshold was reduced from 30% to 25% to be in line with best practice and unvested awards were made subject to clawback.
Use of discretion The Remuneration Committee may exercise discretion in two broad areas for each element of remuneration: To ensure fairness and align executive director remuneration with underlying individual and Company performance, the committee may adjust upwards or downwards the outcome of any shortor long-term incentive plan payment within the limits of the relevant plan rules.
Any adjustments in light of corporate events will be made on a neutral basis, i. e. the intention of any adjustment will be that the event is not to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Adjustments to underlying performance may be made in exceptional circumstances to ensure outcomes are fair both to shareholders and participants.
In the case of a non-regular event occurring, the committee may apply its discretion to ensure fairness and seek alignment with business objectives.
Non-regular events in this context include, but are not limited to: corporate transactions, changes in the Companys accounting policies, minor or administrative matters, internal promotions, external recruitment and terminations.
Any use of discretion by the committee during the financial year will be detailed in the relevant annual report on remuneration.
Performance measure selection Economic profit has been selected as the measure for the annual bonus plan, as it captures growth, returns and risk.
The use of a single measure provides simplicity and focus.
Economic profit is defined as operating profit after deducting the actual tax charge and a capital charge based on the weighted average cost of capital applied to the average capital employed.
The operating profit is the profit before any goodwill impairment, interest and tax.
Average capital employed is based on a 12 month average starting on 1 April including cumulative goodwill but excluding net cash indebtedness.
At the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee, exceptional items may be removed from operating profit where the inclusion of such items would be inconsistent with fair measurement, and actual tax may be adjusted to normalised rates if they are considered unsustainable.
Performance targets relating to the annual bonus plan are set from the Companys annual budget, which is reviewed and signed off by the Companys board prior to the start of each financial year.
Relative TSR has been selected as the measure for the LTIP as it is considered the best measure of long-term performance for PayPoint, is directly aligned with shareholder interests and rewards management for outperformance of the Companys peers.
The FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is currently considered to be the most appropriate benchmark, being representative of PayPoints size and given PayPoints lack of listed sector peers.
TSR is calculated using the three month average share price preceding the start and end of the performance period.
The target for economic profit applying to the annual bonus is set annually, based on a number of internal and external relevance points.
The target is set to be stretching but achievable, with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic environment in a given year.
Remuneration policy for other employees PayPoints approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the group, with consideration given to the level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and salary levels in comparable companies.
All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Companys SIP and senior managers participate in the annual bonus scheme with the same measure at the appropriate business level as is set for the executive directors at group level, but each with personal targets in addition.
Members of the Executive Board who are not executive directors will be eligible to receive an additional one-off bonus award in respect of the financial year ending 31 March 2017.
Payment of the bonus will be subject to the delivery of agreed strategic objectives.
Members of the Executive Board and senior managers c. 25 individuals are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while award sizes vary by organisational level.
48 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Shareholding guidelines The committee recognises the importance of executive directors aligning their interests with shareholders through building up a significant shareholding in the Company.
Shareholding guidelines are in place, which require executive directors to acquire a holding, equivalent to at least 100% of their salaries.
Executive directors are required to retain 50% of any LTIP and deferred bonus shares acquired on vesting net of tax until the guideline level is achieved.
Acquired holdings may be held by spouses or dependent family members.
Non-executive director remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive directors is within the limits set by the articles of association.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company.
Details of the policy on fees paid to our non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Performance Element and link to strategy Operation Opportunity metrics Fees Fee levels are reviewed annually, with any Non-executive director fee increases are Continued To attract and retain adjustments effective 1 April in the year applied in line with the outcome of the strong and non-executive following review.

PayPoint plc Annual Report 2016 49 Remuneration report continued Pay scenario charts The charts below provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the executive directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on PayPoints remuneration policy, applied to base salaries as at 1 April 2016.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance based on the maximum bonus opportunity under the current remuneration policy of 106% of salary.
For the LTIP, the award opportunities are based on LTIP awards under the current remuneration policy of 145% of salary for the Chief Executive and 125% of salary for other executive directors.
Note that LTIP awards granted in the year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value is based on the face value at award rather than vesting i. e. the scenarios exclude the impact of any share price movement over the period.

Where new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall may be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years subject to the individuals development in the role Pension New appointees will receive contributions to personal pension plans in line with existing policy Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line with existing policy SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP in line with existing policy Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees with the relevant maximum 150% of being pro-rated to reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
Targets for the personal salary objectives element will be tailored to the executive LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other executives, as 300% of described in the policy table.
The normal limit of 200% of salary will apply, save in exceptional salary circumstances when awards of up to 300% of salary may be made In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors including quantum, nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both PayPoint and its shareholders.
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, the committee may consider it appropriate to grant an award under a different structure in order to facilitate the recruitment of an individual, exercising the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule LR 9.4.
2 R to replace incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Such buyout awards would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited.
In doing so, the committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining.
Internal appointment In cases of appointing a new executive director by way of internal promotion, the Remuneration Committee and board will be consistent with the policy for external appointees detailed above.
Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements.
Non-executive directors In recruiting a new non-executive director, the Remuneration Committee will utilise the policy as set out in the table on page 49.
PayPoint plc Annual Report 2016 51 Remuneration report continued Service contracts and exit policy Executive directors Executive director service contracts, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the committee.
In accordance with general market practice, each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract requiring 12 months notice of termination on either side.
Executive director service contracts are available to view at the Companys registered office.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the Company are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date D Taylor 12 months 13 September 2004 G Earle 12 months 30 September 2004 T Watkin-Rees 12 months 13 September 2004 There are no special provisions in service contracts relating to cessation of employment or change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
Under normal circumstances, executive directors may receive termination payments in lieu of notice equal to pay and benefits for the length of their contractual notice period.
When considering exit payments, the committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and participants.
The table below summarises how the awards under the annual bonus and LTIP are typically treated in specific circumstances.
Whilst the committee retains overall discretion on determining good leaver status, it typically defines a good leaver in circumstances such as death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement with the Companys consent, redundancy or any other reason that the committee determines.
Bad leavers include those leaving employment due to resignation or misconduct, and retirement without agreement of the Company.
Final treatment is subject to the committees discretion: Event Timing vesting of award Calculation of vesting payment Annual bonus Good leaver Paid at the same time as Eligible for an award to the extent that performance targets are continuing employees satisfied and the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the financial year served.

52 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Outstanding matching awards under the 2009 DSB Plan will be treated in the same way as awards under the LTIP.
Mandatorily deferred and voluntarily invested shares under this plan are simply held on trust for participants and therefore would be released immediately on cessation or a change of control.
Non-executive directors The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, rather they have letters of appointment which are subject to a three year term.
Details of the terms of appointment of the non-executive directors are set out in the table below: Name Date of letter Unexpired term as at 31 March 2016 Date of appointment Notice period D Morrison 24 July 2013 115 days 10 August 2004 1 month 1 N Wiles 24 July 2013 852 days 22 October 2009 1 month N Carson 18 June 2014 478 days 23 July 2014 1 month G Barr 27 May 2015 852 days 01 June 2015 1 month G Kerr 28 October 2015 852 days 20 November 2015 1 month 1.
Nick Wiles signed a new letter of appointment following his appointment as Chairman on 8 May 2015 with an unexpired term of three years.
Under the Companys articles of association, all directors are required to submit themselves for re-election every three years.
However, in order to comply with the Code and as reported last year, all directors will be subject to annual re-election.
Non-executive directors letters of appointment are available to view at the Companys registered office.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company When making decisions on executive director remuneration, the committee considers pay and conditions across PayPoint.
In particular, it is anticipated that salary increases for senior executives will have regard to those of salaried employees as a whole.
Employee engagement surveys are carried out annually across the group, with questions which seek the employees views on these matters.
Participation in these surveys is generally in excess of 80% of all employees.
Consideration of shareholder views The Remuneration Committee maintains a regular dialogue with its major shareholders and when determining remuneration, takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
The committee continues to monitor trends and developments in corporate governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate and commits to undergo a shareholder consultation in advance of any material changes to remuneration policy.
This report covers the remuneration of all directors that served during the period.
This report was approved by the Remuneration Committee on 26 May 2016 and signed on its behalf by: Neil Carson Chairman Remuneration Committee 26 May 2016 PayPoint plc Annual Report 2016 53
