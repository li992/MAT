Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of pay under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, On-target and Maximum.

For the April award, vesting for 50% of the award is dependent on the Companys EPS performance in excess of a risk-free return, defined as average three-month LIBOR, over a threeyear period commencing on 1 January 2014.
10% of shares vest for matching LIBOR, full vesting occurs for outperforming LIBOR by 10% p. a. with straight-line vesting in between.
No vesting occurs for EPS growth below LIBOR.
For the remaining 50% of the April award, vesting is subject to continued employment only, as the award was made prior to Geraint Jones appointment to the Board.
For the September award, vesting of 100% of the award is dependent on the Companys EPS performance, and the targets are the same as for the April award.
The table below details the Companys EPS performance against targets and vesting outcome over the performance period ending on 31 December 2016.

50% and 0% of Geraint Jones April and September 2014 DFSS awards, respectively, will vest in April 2017 and September 2017, respectively, subject to his continued employment on the vesting dates.
DFSS bonus in respect of 2016 The Group paid a bonus to all holders of DFSS shares in 2016, which was equivalent to the dividend payable on all outstanding DFSS shares awarded but not yet vested.
The Committee continues to feel that having a bonus equivalent to the dividend flow received by investors further aligns the incentive structure with shareholders.
Neither Henry Engelhardt nor David Stevens received a DFSS bonus as they do not participate in the DFSS.
From 2015, DFSS bonus payments are subject to clawback in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct.
Scheme interests granted in 2016 audited DFSS In September 2016, Geraint Jones was granted an award under the DFSS of 50,000 shares with a value at the date of award of 1,039,500 based on share price of 20.79, equivalent to 495% of salary.
The three-year period over which performance will be measured is 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018.
The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third anniversary of the date of grant i. e. September 2019, subject to performance and to continued employment.
David Stevens again declined to be included given his significant shareholding.
The award will vest on three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 excluding investment companies, and ROE, weighted equally.

Please refer to the 2015 Directors Remuneration Report for full details of actual performance against targets for this award.
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2017 Executive Directors Salary, Pension and Benefits Remuneration for the Executive Directors in 2017 will be determined in line with the latest policy.
The Committee approved the following base salaries for the Executive Directors in 2016: Director Latest salary 2016 salary % change Effective date Geraint Jones 245,000 210,000 17% 1 January 2017 David Stevens 388,236 378,767 2% 1 September 2016 As stated in previous reports, Geraint Jones was appointed to the Board on a relatively low salary and the Committee expects to make salary increases in the first few years of his appointment that are above general inflation to reflect his demonstrated development in the CFO role and the performance of the business.
The Committee will determine the levels of future increases taking into account both his individual and Company performance, and with reference to market pay levels.
Geraints current salary of 245,000 continues to be in the lower quartile for FTSE 100 companies of a similar size.
Geraint Jones will continue to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, where employee contributions are matched up to a maximum 6% of base salary with maximum employer contribution of 9,000.
David Stevens will also continue to participate in the plan, on the same basis as in 2015.
Both Executive Directors will continue to receive benefits in line with the policy.
DFSS In advance of each DFSS cycle, the Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance measures and corresponding targets.
Vesting of the 2017 award will be linked to the same three performance measures set for the 2016 awards, i. e. three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 excluding investment companies, and ROE, weighted equally.
The Committee intends to make DFSS awards in October 2017 and it is anticipated that targets will be the same as those for awards in 2016, as summarised in the table below.
The Committee will determine the precise targets closer to the time of making the awards, later in the year, and will disclose them in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration The table below shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from 2015 compared to the average percentage change in remuneration for all other employees.
The analysis is based on a consistent set of employees, i. e. the same individuals appear in the 2015 and 2016 populations.
As the CEO does not participate in the DFSS bonus scheme, to provide a meaningful comparison we have also included data for the CFO who receives DFSS awards.
Based on the sum of remuneration paid to Henry Engelhardt up to and including 13 May 2016 and to David Stevens from 13 May 2016.
DFSS bonus change represents the change in dividends paid, which is the driver of the level of bonus payable to holders of unvested DFSS shares.
Relative importance of spend on pay The table below shows the percentage change in dividends and total employee remuneration spend from the financial year ended 31 December 2015 to the financial year ended 31 December 2016.
