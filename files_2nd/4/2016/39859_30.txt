STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR ENDING 30 SEPTEMBER 2017 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS SALARIES FROM 1 DECEMBER 2016 The Committee recommended general increases for executive directors and employees with effect from 1 December 2016.
Pension and other benefits are as described in the Remuneration Policy table.
ANNUAL BONUS TARGETS Executive directors will be eligible for a maximum bonus of up to 150% of salary if taken in shares and 100% of salary if taken in cash, in accordance with the Remuneration Policy.
Disclosure of annual bonus targets for the year ending 30 September 2017 is deemed to be commercially sensitive and therefore the actual targets are not set out in this report.
The targets will be disclosed retrospectively next year, provided they are no longer commercially sensitive.
MEASURE WEIGHTING TARGET OR REASON FOR NON-DISCLOSURE 1 Achieve growth in ERVs 20% The Committee considers specific disclosure of targets regarding the achievement of rental levels, the speed of completing letting or delivery of specific projects or 1 Let vacant space on a timely basis 10% transactions would be prejudicial to the interests of shareholders.

A two-year post-vesting holding period will apply to these awards.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES FROM 1 DECEMBER 2016 Non-executive director fees are reviewed every two years.
The previous review was undertaken in 2015 and therefore no changes will apply this year to fees, other than the Chairmans fee which was set at 150,000.
Non-executive fees are 55,000 per annum.
There is an additional fee of 10,000 where a non-executive director chairs a committee and for the Senior Independent Director if not already in receipt of a Committee Chairman fee.
The Chairman does not receive an additional fee for chairing the Nomination Committee.

Maximum performance target 100% Actual performance as a % of maximum see below for the 82% actual amount awarded and explanatory note COMMITTEES EXERCISE OF DISCRETION The Groups strategy is long-term.
The Committee considers it appropriate to maintain a consistent approach to target setting for both annual and long-term incentives.
The Committee is mindful that annual bonus awards should fairly reflect performance in the round.
The formulaic outturn of quantitative targets is therefore considered in the context of factors such as the buoyancy of occupier demand in the wider West End market and progression against longer-term strategic goals, to ensure the level of bonus is appropriate.
Whilst the achievement against the targets was 82%, the Committee felt that a more reasonable award in view of general market conditions during the year was 60% of maximum, assuming the bonus was taken in cash.
All the executive directors elected to take their bonus in shares which equates to an award of 90% out of a maximum opportunity of 150% of their salary.

Awards under the schemes below were made in February 2016, following approval of the Remuneration Policy by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
This was to permit the grant under the new rules including post-vesting holding periods for the LTIP and malus clawback provisions in both schemes.

No further performance criteria are applied to share awards 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2018.
Performance measures are set out in the table below.
In view of the Groups long-term strategy, a consistent approach to target setting is taken for the LTIP.
The performance criteria for the 2016 awards, which have been applied consistently since 2006, are set out below.
However, two minor changes were made from the calibration of the targets in previous years.
First, the TSR benchmark index was changed from the FTSE350 Real Estate Index to the FTSE350 REIT Index which the Committee believes to be a more direct and appropriate comparator.
Second, threshold vesting was equalised to 25% on both elements of the award having previously been 20% for the TSR element and 30% for the NAV element.
