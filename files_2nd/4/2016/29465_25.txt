10 The PSP awards due to vest in 2015 and 2016 lapsed in full.
11 The pension value represents the cash value of pension accrued over 1 year x a multiple of 20 in line with statutory reporting requirements.
12 directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.
Salary The salaries shown in the table reflect a 2015 16 salary, effective from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, of 824,320 for the Chief Executive and 637,133 for the Finance Director.
2015 16 AIP The AIP award is determined by performance against three financial metrics Adjusted PBT, DPS Growth and Cash-flow and three areas of non-financial performance Customer, Teamworking and Personal.
The table below provides more information on the measures and the performance that was ultimately delivered.

SSE continues to be recognised by a variety of trusted third parties for the quality of its service, including: the Ombudsman for Energy Services report in March 2016 that SSE received the fewest complaints of all 10 suppliers covered: the Citizens Advice Energy Supplier Performance Report, in which SSE continues to perform strongly: and in reports on the large energy suppliers conducted by uSwitch, Which?
and the Institute of Customer Service.
Service performance for SSEs Networks customers has also been high, with a lower number and duration of power cuts experienced by customers in 2015 16 resulting in the best-ever performance for the business.
78% 12% Teamworking 20% Teamwork measures performance against the SSESET of core values.
The Committee assesses each area before reaching an overall conclusion on the performance out-turn.
- Safety Performance was broadly in line with last years performance with a low Accident Frequency Rate of 0.10 and Total Recordable Injury Rate of 0.23.
Overall this performance reflects the fact that SSE is achieving a good level of safety performance when compared to industry in general, and our sector in particular.
- Service As indicated above, SSE continues to provide good performance in both Energy Supply customer surveys and in the number and duration of power cuts experienced by Networks customers.
- Efficiency Significant value secured from a programme of asset disposals started in 2014, with agreements to secure proceeds and debt reduction of over 1bn.
- Sustainability During 2015 16, SSE made further significant progress towards its 2020 target of reducing the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates by 50%.
In addition, SSE continued to facilitate the connection of renewable sources of electricity to the transmission system, including the completion of the Beauly-Denny replacement line and a successful start to the new Caithness-Moray link.
- Excellence SSE was one of the first FTSE100 companies, and the first energy company, to become an accredited Living Wage employer in 2013.
Work began in 2015 16 to demonstrate the progress in implementing the Living Wage to contracted employees, with 50% of all relevant contracts requiring the Living Wage to be paid to contracted employees working on site.
- Teamwork The Great Place to Work survey produced a strong set of results indicating a high level of employee engagement with SSEs engagement index rising 4% on last year to 77%.
83% 17% Personal 15% During 2015 16, against a challenging business environment the Executive Directors delivered strong performance against individual objectives by successfully delivering a high level of customer performance, maintaining a clear focus on safety and operational performance, effective communication channels with key stakeholders, reviewing the business strategy, setting out plans for investment and growth, developing effective cost control and efficiency programmes, delivering the disposal programme to maintain a strong balance sheet, and ensuring that employees remained engaged and motivated to deliver for SSE.
80% 12% 54% Executive Directors were eligible to receive an AIP of up to 100% of salary in respect of 2015 16.
Based on performance against these targets, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director received payment of 54% of maximum.
One-quarter of the award will be payable in shares deferred for a further three years.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply to the 2015 16 AIP award.

Benefits Benefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similar sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Company.
Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening.
The Executive Directors participate in the Companys all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.
Pension In common with all members of the pension schemes who joined at the same time as the Executive Directors, the following provisions relating to leaving the Company apply: for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid: in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50: and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension being paid on an unreduced basis.
The Executive Directors are members of either the Southern Electric Pension Scheme or the Scottish Hydro-Electric Pension Scheme and their plan membership predates their Board appointments.
These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members.
The Directors service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.
In relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements the Company provides top-up unfunded arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned if they had not been subject to the salary cap.
There are no arrangements to compensate members for any change in their personal tax liability.
Dependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committees policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit UURB pension at the time of leaving.
Any cash commutation would limit SSEs liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and would be undertaken on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.

Recovery provisions The Committee believes that it is right that it should have the ability to recover pay in circumstances where that pay is later proved to have been unfairly earned.
The PSP and AIP have the following recovery provisions: Malus Clawback What is it?

Both current Executive Directors have shareholdings above this level.
Statement of implementation for 2016 17 This section provides an overview of how the Committee intends to operate the new Remuneration Policy for 2016 17, subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM.
2016 17 remuneration review and shareholder consultation During 2015 the Committee undertook a review of the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors to ensure their continued relevance and alignment with SSEs strategy.
Following this review, a number of changes are proposed which are in line with SSEs core principles of simplicity, balance, customer focus, delivery and stewardship.
The Committee values the views of shareholders.
The Committee Chairman, on the behalf of the Committee, consulted with SSEs largest shareholders, as well as the Investment Association and Institutional Shareholder Services, in developing these proposals.
The feedback received was extremely helpful in informing the Committees decisions.
Link with SSEs strategy SSEs core purpose is to provide the energy people need in a reliable and sustainable way, whilst recognising the need to reward shareholders who have either invested directly in SSE or, as owners of the Company, have enabled it to borrow money from debt investors to finance investments that will help to meet customers energy needs over the long term.
To support this purpose incentives are aligned to a balanced range of performance measures, including measures related to the customer experience and SSEs culture and values, measures related to the return to shareholders on their investment total shareholder return and dividends per share, and measures related to the financial stability of SSE and the ability to make future investments cashflow and profit.
SSEs remuneration structure is also designed to support its strategy by retaining the services of the best leaders.
This means ensuring pay is at a level which is appropriate for the complexity and challenges of the role and takes into account the marketability of senior talent.
In order to support SSEs strategy, pay levels are linked to stretching and relevant targets and include important safeguards such as malus and clawback.
SSE is a business which is investing for the long term.
It is therefore important that the remuneration structure is aligned to the long-term sustainability and stewardship of the company.
The remuneration structure therefore includes significant shareholding requirements, holding periods and the new career deferral which extends the time that deferred shares are held until a year after an Executive Director steps down from their position.
107 Directors Report Annual Remuneration Report 2015 16 continued Base Salary The Committee reviewed salary levels for Executive Directors, taking into account a number of factors including individual performance and the salary increases awarded to the wider SSE population.
Effective from 1 April 2016, the two Executive Directors will receive a salary increase of 2.4%, which is in line with the average performance-based salary increases for the wider SSE employee population.
This will move the Chief Executives salary to 844,104 and the Finance Directors salary to 652,424.
Benefits There are no changes proposed to the benefits framework for 2016 17.
The emphasis on pension in total reward has been decreased by introducing a limit on pensionable earnings through a cap on Pension pensionable base pay growth of RPI 1% from 1 April 2017.
The Committee considers that using a balanced range of performance measures is aligned to SSEs objectives.
Incentive plans The performance measures and weightings for the Annual Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan will be the same as for performance 2015 16 as detailed below: measures Annual Incentive Plan Performance Share Plan Performance measure Weighting Performance measure Weighting 1 1 Financial 50% Relative TSR 40% 2 Customer 15% EPS 20% 3 Team-working 20% Growth in DPS versus RPI 20% Personal 15% Customer service Citizens Advice league table 20% 1 Financial measures consist of Adjusted PBT 30%, 1 Relative TSR is measured against two comparator groups, being the FTSE 100 and a group of European Growth in DPS 10% and Cash-flow 10%.
25% vesting for median and 100% for upper quartile.
2 25% vesting for RPI, 80% vesting for RPI 5% and 100% vesting for RPI 10%.
3 50% vesting for growth of RPI and 100% vesting for RPI 5%.
The entry level vesting percentage for DPS growth reflects the higher degree of stretch of this target.
Taking into account the importance of dividend growth to shareholders, the Committee operates a principle of no vesting for below RPI growth.
However, it is recognised that sustained growth at RPI would be good performance in the context of SSEs business environment and is considered to be a stretching level of performance rather than a threshold level of performance.
As last year, the entry level vesting has therefore been set at 50% for achieving this stretch.
In assessing performance against DPS the Committee must be satisfied that a reasonable level of dividend cover has been maintained.
The customer service measure is based on an independent external customer measure Citizens Advice League Table and the measure compares SSEs performance with the other energy suppliers.
The comparator group has been increased from the other five large energy suppliers to the new wider comparator group of 18 energy suppliers.
The entry level vesting is being reduced from 50% to 25%, with threshold vesting for 9th position above median and maximum vesting only for 1st position out of 18.
In the context of the increase to overall incentives the Committee increased the targets for a number of the PSP measures: - Maximum EPS growth target increased from RPI 8% to RPI 10% - Maximum DPS growth target increased from RPI 4% to RPI 5% Annual From the annual incentive awarded in respect of 2016 17 onwards, the deferral period will be extended from the current three years Incentive to one year after an Executive Director steps down from their position.
The deferred shares will continue to be subject to continued Plan Career employment for a period of three years, but will not be delivered until one year following the end of the Executive Directors tenure.
deferral and This approach, which goes beyond current best practice for deferral arrangements seen in the wider market, supports Executive deferral Directors commitment to the long-term sustainability and stewardship of SSE, even after leaving.
percentage The percentage of the annual incentive plan award that is deferred will be increased from 25% to 33%, further aligning Executive Directors with the interests of shareholders and supports SSEs commitment to long-term sustainability and stewardship.
Performance Performance Share Plan awards will be subject to performance over three years and will have a two-year holding period following Share Plan the end of the performance period.
holding period 108 SSE plc Annual Report 2016 1.
Incentive Variable incentive levels were last reviewed over eight years ago and have remained unchanged since.
In that time, the environment in opportunity which SSE operates has become significantly more complex and challenging, including significant additional devolution within the UK, and more complex and wide-ranging regulation.
As a result, the role of Executive Directors now includes engaging effectively with policy-makers and regulators and providing leadership within the sector, as well as balancing value to customers and shareholders, while making the long-term investment decisions which will sustain dividends for shareholders over the longer term.
As part of the wide ranging review, the Committee looked at incentive levels taking into consideration any retention risk and the marketability of the Executive Directors, the complexity and challenges of the Executive Director role in the environment that SSE operates, and the role of incentives in supporting strategy.
While these were the principal considerations, the Committee also had available relevant benchmark reference points to inform the Committees thinking.
Against the background and context provided above, the Committee felt that it was right to increase the overall incentive opportunity to levels which are commensurate with the size and complexity of the organisation, but which would still position SSE conservatively against a range of relevant benchmark reference points.
The proposed new incentive levels are set out below: 2016 17 AIP maximum opportunity 2016 17 PSP maximum opportunity CEO 150% of salary 200% of salary 2015 16: 100% 2015 16: 150% FD 130% of salary 175% of salary 2015 16: 100% 2015 16: 150% Both Annual Incentive and Performance Share Plan awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions, as set out in the Malus and Recovery Provisions section on page 107. clawback 200% of salary.

The all-employee base salary change is based on comparing the change in the average basic salary increase at April 2015 and April 2016.
The Chief Executive change in benefits is calculated on the same basis as the single figure table on page 104.
The all-employee change in benefits is based on P11D data from 2015 and 2016.
The 15.09% increase is largely due to the increase in the number of company cars which can be attributed to an increase in employees who participate in a salary sacrifice car scheme, and also new entrants to the company car scheme following acquisition.
The Chief Executive annual incentive is calculated on the same basis as the single figure table on page 104.
The all-employee change in annual incentive reflects the average out-turn for all eligible employees in 2015 and 2016.
