CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT STATEMENT BY THE CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees annual report on Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2016.
Dear fellow Shareholder, The report sets out the Groups remuneration policy and gives details of the remuneration paid to Executive and Non-Executive Directors for their services to the Company during the year.
The report also sets out how the remuneration policy will operate in the year to 31 March 2017.
OVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK The primary aim of the Committee is to align the remuneration framework with business strategy, performance and value created for Shareholders.
The remuneration policy aims to: link the remuneration received by the Executive Directors with the creation of long-term Shareholder value: reward for the successful delivery of the business strategy: provide the right balance between short-term and long-term incentives: and align senior management remuneration with that of the Executive Directors.
OVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2016 As highlighted in the Chairmans Statement on pages 6 and 7, the past year has seen Cranswick achieve strong commercial growth and deliver continued strategic progress.
Adjusted profit before tax increased by 13.7 per cent to 65.7 million: adjusted earnings per share also improved by 13.7 per cent to 104.7 pence: and the dividend per share was 10.3 per cent higher at 37.5 pence giving an excellent return for our Shareholders.
During the year the share price has increased 55.4 per cent from 1,373p at 31 March 2015 to 2,133p at 31 March 2016, valuing the market capital of the business at over 1 billion.
This compares to an increase of 10.8 per cent in the FTSE 350 Food Producers and Processors Index over the same period.
The challenging bonus targets for the Executive Directors which were set by the Remuneration Committee were linked to the stretching 2016 Group budget.
As stated on page 66, performance in the year was above the highest target level and so the maximum bonus of 150 per cent of salary was awarded.
The 2013 Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP award, which is due to vest in June 2016, will achieve 100 per cent of both the Earnings Per Share EPS target and the Total Shareholder Return TSR target, resulting in full vesting of the share award.
This is reflected in the table on page 66.
During the year the Committee awarded nil-cost share options under the LTIP scheme to senior executives, including the Executive Directors.
The number of shares awarded to each Executive Director was equivalent to 150 per cent of base salary, based on the market value of the Companys shares at the date of award.
These awards are reflected in the table on page 69.
As reported last year, the pay award to the Executive Directors on 1 May 2015 was based on increased personal workloads where applicable, resulting in increases of 4.8 per cent to Adam Couch, 14.0 per cent to Jim Brisby, and 2.6 per cent to each of Mark Bottomley and Martin Davey.
These are reflected in the table on page 66.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING VOTING As mentioned last year, a revised Directors Remuneration Policy, requiring the Executive Directors to have a minimum shareholding of 200 per cent of base salary and also introducing new rules for the LTIP to include a two-year post vesting holding period and malus and clawback provisions, was put to the Shareholders at the 2015 AGM.
It is pleasing to report that over 95 per cent of those voting supported the policy and the full breakdown of the votes is reported on page 71.
60 Cranswick plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Highlights Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31 MARCH 2017 There are no planned changes to the basis of the Executive Directors remuneration following the benchmarking exercise carried out last year.
The Executive Directors were awarded an increase of 1.6 per cent which is in line with the annualised increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI as at 31 March 2016.
This increase is slightly below the average increase awarded to senior executives and to other employees in the Group taking into account local practices and regional variations in pay and conditions, and the new National Living Wage.
Following the increase in pay, which will be applicable from 1 May 2016, the Executive Directors base salary will be: Director New salary Rationale Adam Couch 599,450 Increase in line with RPI Mark Bottomley 396,250 Increase in line with RPI.
Jim Brisby 396,250 Increase in line with RPI.
Martin Davey 304,800 Increase in line with RPI.
The 2017 bonus scheme in operation is based on the achievement of Group profit targets which are set having regard to the Companys budget, historical performance and market outlook for the year.
The actual 2017 targets are not disclosed as they are considered to be commercially sensitive.
The targets will be declared retrospectively in the 2017 Annual Report, provided they are not considered commercially sensitive at that time.
There are four bonus profit targets triggering awards of 20 per cent, 50 per cent, 100 per cent and 150 per cent of base salaries with a straight line pro-rata award for profits falling between the targets.
There is a small fixed sum paid out at the half year stage based on the achievement of the half year profit target, which forms part of the total bonus award.
LTIP awards, equivalent to 150 per cent of basic salary, will be made in June 2016, and vesting will be after a three year performance period for both TSR and EPS, but with a further two-year holding period.
MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING The Remuneration Committee has also recommended that the Executive Directors hold shares in the Company worth at least 200 per cent of base salary, with the holding to be built up over a five-year period.
The Directors current holdings and value are now all in excess of the 200 per cent target and are shown on page 70.
REMUNERATION DISCLOSURE This report complies with the requirements of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013 the Regulations, the principles of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.
The report contains two separate sections: the Chairs letter and the Annual Report on Remuneration which will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM: and the Directors Remuneration Policy which was approved by the Shareholders at the 2015 AGM and which is shown for reference purposes only.
The Directors Remuneration Policy report: sets out the different elements which make up the Executive Directors remuneration: explains how each component operates: and details the performance metrics which underpin each element of remuneration.
The Annual Report on Remuneration discloses how the Directors Remuneration Policy has been applied during the year and how it will be applied for 2017.
SUMMARY The Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor the Directors Remuneration Policy to ensure that it is correctly aligned with the Groups business strategy and targets.
The objective is to ensure that the financial interests of the Executive Directors, other senior management and employees are aligned with the achievement of the Groups objectives.
The Remuneration Committee considers the policy set out in this report, to be an appropriate one, which aims to properly reward performance in line with the Companys business objectives and growth and delivery of enhanced Shareholder value.
On behalf of the Committee Steven Esom Chair of the Remuneration Committee 24 May 2016 Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Cranswick plc 61 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY The current remuneration policy, which was approved at the 2015 AGM on 27 July 2015, is set out below.
LINK BETWEEN POLICY, STRATEGY AND STRUCTURE Cranswicks remuneration policy is principally designed to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and senior executives to effectively execute its corporate and business strategy in order to deliver annual operating plans and sustainable year-on-year profit growth, as well as to generate and preserve value to its Shareholders over the longer term without encouraging excessive levels of risk taking.
The principles and values that underpin the remuneration strategy are applied on a consistent basis for all Group employees.
It is the Groups policy to reward all employees fairly, responsibly and by reference to local market practices, by providing an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration.
The remuneration package is in two parts: a non-performance part represented by basic salary including pension and benefits : and a significant performance related element in the form of a profit related bonus and share-based awards.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package are set out below: Purpose and Performance link to strategy Operation metrics Maximum entitlement Base salary To provide a market Set competitively to reflect the individuals Any increase is There is no prescribed maximum increase.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Cranswick plc 63 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED ANNUAL BONUS PERFORMANCE TARGETS The structure of the performance targets applicable to annual bonus awards to be made in a particular year will be set out in the implementation section of the Annual Report on Remuneration which precedes that year rather than in this remuneration policy report.
The actual targets will not be disclosed in advance as they are considered to be commercially sensitive information, however, the details of these targets will be disclosed retrospectively, provided they are not considered commercially sensitive at that time.
Historically, Group profit before tax, as adjusted for acquisitions, disposals and other non-trading items, was the sole metric against which the annual bonus award was assessed.
The policy has been amended to allow flexibility for the Committee to introduce other financial measures, if deemed necessary, to provide an appropriately balanced and stretching incentive.
Again, such metrics will be disclosed in the implementation section.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Under the policy approved at the 2015 AGM, an award to an individual cannot exceed 150 per cent of that individuals annual salary except in exceptional circumstances when up to 200 per cent of the annual salary is permitted.
A summary of the main terms of the new scheme which was approved and adopted following the 2015 AGM is as follows: awards made to Executive Directors in the form of nil-cost options: a normal maximum award to the Executive Directors of 150 per cent of base salary: a two-year post vesting holding period applies: and a claw back and malus policy for profit misstatement, performance error or misconduct by a participant.
DISCRETION The Committee retains discretion to make any payments, notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration of the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
RECRUITMENT POLICY The recruitment policy is that new Directors will be entitled to participate in the short-term and long-term incentive plans on the same basis as that for existing Directors set out in the policy table, including the same limits on quantum of awards under those plans.
Where the new Director is an internal candidate their level of pay will be based on their increasing role and responsibilities and in line with market rates.
Any incentive awards made before their promotion will continue to apply.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make awards in addition to the normal participation in the Companys incentive plans to a new Director to buy out the awards to which the Director would have been entitled from their previous employer where it considers that this is necessary to attract the right person.
Such awards may be made through a combination of performance and non-performance awards which reflect the profile of the awards foregone and which take into account the likelihood of the performance conditions of those awards being met, in order and so far as is possible to provide an equivalent opportunity which is overall no more generous than the awards foregone.
Where appropriate the Company may also pay reasonable relocation and related costs.
TERMINATION POLICY There are no termination or exit payments in any of the service contracts.
Any sums payable up to the point of leaving will be considered by the Remuneration Committee and will include: salary, benefits and pension earnings up to the date of leaving as per the service agreement: for a good leaver only, any bonus earned subject to the discretion of the Committee accrued and apportioned to the date of leaving: for a good leaver only, any share awards due, as per the rules of the scheme, apportioned to the date of leaving: and any pay in lieu of notice.
A leaver will be a good leaver in the event of: retirement: redundancy: illness, disability or injury: death: or in other circumstances if the Committee, in its discretion, considers it appropriate.
OVERALL POLICY The Groups policy is that the overall remuneration package offered should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality executives whilst giving consideration to salary levels in similar sized quoted companies in the sector and in the region.
Their sharebased awards LTIP are aligned with the long-term progress of the Group and in line with the Shareholders interests.
The bonus award is linked to the performance of the business based on key financial metrics.
SERVICE CONTRACTS The Remuneration Committees current policy is not to enter into employment contracts with any element of notice period in excess of one year.
Accordingly, the following Executive Directors have a one-year rolling contract: Adam Couch commencing 1 May 2006 revised 1 August 2012, Mark Bottomley from 1 June 2009 and Jim Brisby from 26 July 2010.
For early termination the Remuneration Committee will consider the circumstances including any duty to mitigate loss and determine compensation payments accordingly.
The service contract for Martin Davey includes a one-year notice period from 1 May 2006 except in the case of a takeover of the Company when the notice period is two years for the first six months following the takeover.
The contract also has special provisions relating to liquidated damages requiring that the notice period stipulated in the contract will be paid in full.
These conditions were incorporated into new contracts several years ago when the Directors changed from contracts that had notice periods of up to three years.
Whilst these contractual terms differ from the current policy, the Remuneration Committee has concluded that it would not be appropriate, in the circumstances, to seek to further amend the contractual terms agreed with this individual in 2006.
64 Cranswick plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Highlights Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS Each Non-Executive Director has an appointment letter Steven Esom for three years from 12 November 2014, Kate Allum for three years from 1 July 2013 and Mark Reckitt for three years from 1 May 2014.
The continuing appointments are subject to annual re-election at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and reflects: the time, commitment and responsibility of their roles: that their fees are reviewed annually with consideration being given to market rates and the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience: and that they do not participate in the Groups incentive bonus arrangement, pension scheme or share-based awards.
Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment are held at the Companys Registered Office and will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
PAY AND CONDITIONS ACROSS THE GROUP The Committee does not directly consult with employees regarding the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
However, when considering remuneration levels to apply, the Committee will take into account base pay increases, bonus payments and share awards made to the Companys employees generally.
The following are the key aspects of how pay and employment conditions across the Group are taken into account when setting the remuneration of employees, including the Executive Directors: the Group operates within the UK food sector and has many employees who carry out demanding tasks within the business: all employees, including Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate: performance is measured and rewarded through a number of performance related bonus schemes across the Group including LTIP share options for Executive Directors and senior executives: performance measures are cascaded down through the organisation to individual businesses: the Group offers employment conditions that are commensurate with a medium sized quoted company, including high standards of health and safety and equal opportunities: and the Group operates Save As You Earn share schemes which are open to all eligible employees including Executive Directors.
It is worth noting that around 20 per cent of the work force holds shares in the Company.

Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Cranswick plc 65 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION The Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the policy for the Executive Directors remuneration including terms and conditions of service, the performance conditions for the annual cash bonus and long-term incentive schemes, and the total remuneration packages for senior executives.
In line with the regulations the values for 2016 are based on the average share price over the three month period to 31 March 2016 as these awards will not vest until June 2016 see tables on page 67.
As reported last year the Executive Directors had pay awards in the year of: Adam Couch 4.8% Increased work load following reduction in the Chairmans time commitment Jim Brisby 14.0% Change of role to Commercial Director Mark Bottomley 2.6% In line with the change in RPI Martin Davey 2.6% In line with the change in RPI and then a reduction in time commitment Benefits principally comprise health insurances, personal tax advice, pensions advice and Company car allowance.
Pension consists of contributions of up to 20 per cent of base salary which are paid either into a defined contribution pension scheme or are received as a cash allowance in lieu of the pension contribution, or, as a combination of both.
No Director has any entitlement or prospective entitlement under any defined benefit pension scheme.
The number of Directors who were active members of the money purchase pension scheme in the year was two 2015: two.
ANNUAL BONUS ARRANGEMENT The bonus scheme in operation is based on the achievement of Group profit targets which are set having regard to the Companys budget, historical performance and market outlook for the year.
There is a small fixed sum paid out at the half year stage based on the achievement of the half year profit target.
The profit targets for the year ended 31 March 2016, which may be adjusted to take into account acquisitions and disposals and other nontrading items which arose during the year, were: Threshold Maximum Actual Adjusted profit targets 59.1m 67.3m 70.2m Bonus payable 20% 150% 150% The performance in the year, before charging bonus awards, exceeded the maximum profit target resulting in a bonus award of 150 per cent of salary.
This award is reflected in the table above.
66 Cranswick plc Annual Report & Accounts 2016 Highlights Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The Remuneration Committee awards nil-cost options under the LTIP scheme in order to ensure that Executive Directors and senior management are involved in the longer term success of the Group.
Options can only be exercised if certain performance criteria are achieved by the Group as follows: 50 per cent of each award is subject to an earnings per share EPS target measured against average annual increases in the retail price index RPI over a three-year period.
The EPS target allows 25 per cent of the shares subject to the target to vest at an average annual outperformance above RPI of 3 per cent and 100 per cent of the shares to vest at an average annual outperformance of 7 per cent with outperformance between 3 and 7 per cent rewarded pro-rata.
50 per cent are aligned to a Total Shareholder Return TSR target measured against a comparable group of companies over a three-year period.
The TSR target allows 30 per cent of the shares subject to the target to vest at the 50th percentile and 100 per cent at the 75th percentile with performance between the 50th and 75th percentiles rewarded pro-rata.
The comparison companies used besides Cranswick are: Associated British Foods plc, AG Barr plc, Britvic plc, Carrs Milling Industries plc, Dairy Crest Group plc, Devro plc, Greencore Group plc, Hilton Food Group plc, Kerry Group plc, McBride plc, Premier Foods plc, and Tate and Lyle plc.
The Remuneration Committee, which decides whether performance conditions have been met, considers EPS and TSR to be the most appropriate measures of the long-term performance of the Group.
The value of the LTIP for the year ended 31 March 2016 relates to awards made in 2013 with a performance criteria based on the three years ended 31 March 2016 that will vest in June 2016 calculated at the average price for the three months ending on 31 March 2016 of 1,989 pence.
Over the three year performance period the EPS element of the award, based on the criteria set above, gave an out performance of greater than 9 per cent over the average increase in RPI so achieving a 100 per cent award.
For the TSR element of the award, measured against a comparable group of companies, the business was at the 92nd percentile so again an award of 100 per cent was achieved.
The total award of 100 per cent is reflected in the table on page 66 and below.

The EPS element of the award achieved 91.1 per cent of its performance target and 83.2 per cent was achieved under the TSR measure giving an overall award of 87.1 per cent, and this is reflected in the 2015 column of the table on page 66 and in the table below.

The award in 2016 exercised by Adam Couch had an exercise price of 474 pence per share and a market value of 1,988 pence and the notional gain is shown in the 2016 column of the table on page 66.
Similarly the options exercised in 2015 by Martin Davey had an exercise price of 579 pence and a market price of 1,407 pence and this notional gain is shown in the 2015 column of the table on page 66.
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS AUDITED Bernard Hoggarth, who was previously the Groups Chief Executive until August 2012, stepped down to the role of Commercial Director before retiring from the business at the end of July 2014.
The Committee considered Bernard to be a good leaver under the terms of the LTIP, as defined on page 64, and therefore in accordance with the rules of the LTIP, any award is pro-rated to the date of retirement.
The award which will vest in June 2016, has been adjusted accordingly and is shown below.
000 LTIP vesting in June 2016 240 No other payment was made to Bernard, and there have been no other payments made to past Directors or payments made for loss of office in the year.

50 per cent of the award depends on the performance of EPS and 50 per cent on TSR for the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2018.
If the minimum performance was achieved the EPS element would give 25 per cent and the TSR element would give 30 per cent, overall 27.5 per cent of the grant would vest.

ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE The Committee keeps itself fully informed on the developments within the industry and in the field of remuneration and seeks advice from external advisers where appropriate.
AON Hewitt, which is independent and has no connection to Cranswick, has been retained by the Remuneration Committee for advice throughout the year.
AON Hewitt provides no other services to the Company though it is now part of the AON Corporation group of companies which also provide insurance broking services to the Group.
7,500 was paid to AON Hewitt in the year.
The Committee is satisfied that the provision of such services does not create any conflicts of interest.
In addition  LLP continue to give advice to the Remuneration Committee on share option awards and other benefit schemes, for which 26,500 was paid to them in the year.
 LLP are also tax advisers to the Group.
The Committee is of the opinion that such services do not create a conflict of interest.
The Committee believes the advice given during the year from both AON Hewitt and  LLP has been independent, relevant and objective.
