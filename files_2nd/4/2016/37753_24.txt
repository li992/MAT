2 There are no malus provisions as the Company believes that the current clawback provisions appropriately address the risk of non-payment.
3 T he Annual STI is focused predominantly on key financial performance indicators, to reflect how successful the Group has been in managing its operations.
The balance is determined on how well the executive directors performed against annual Group operational targets including measures of clinical excellence.
The current executive directors STI is calculated on the combined financial EBITDA performance of the three Platforms, weighted relative to their respective EBITDA contribution.
The threshold and stretch targets are based on a percentage of the respected approved budgeted EBITDA.
4 The LTIP incentive rewards significant long-term returns to shareholders and long-term financial growth.
Targets are set on sliding scales that take account of internal strategic planning and external market expectations for the Company.
Only modest rewards are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans approved at the start of each year or on the date of award, as the case may be.
The Committee operates LTI arrangements for the executive directors in accordance with their respective rules, the Listing Rules and the rules of relevant tax authorities where relevant.
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans.
These include but are not limited to the following: Who participates: The timing of the grant of award and or payment: The size of an award up to plan limits and or a payment: Discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction: Determination of a good leaver in addition to any specified categories for incentive plan purposes: Adjustments required in certain circumstances e. g. rights issues, corporate restructuring and special dividends : and The ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.
The relative weights between TSR and EPS are determined annually by the Remuneration Committee.
For the current reporting period TSR and EPS carried a weight of 50% respectively.
For the 2016 2017 allocations EPS weight is 60% and TSR 40%.
PREVIOUS AWARDS Authority was given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors before they became a director such as, the vesting or exercise of past share awards or before this policy came into effect, including those granted by companies in the Group prior to that company becoming part of the Group.
For example, certain directors continue to hold awards granted under the terms of the Mediclinic Forfeitable Share Plan.
THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS PAY AND EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYEES IN THE GROUP WHEN DETERMINING EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION POLICY When considering the executive directors' remuneration structure and levels, the Committee reviews base compensation and STI arrangements for the management team, to ensure that there is a coherent approach across the Group.
The STI arrangements operate on a similar basis across the senior management team.
The key difference in the policy for executive directors is that remuneration is more heavily weighted towards longterm variable pay than other employees.
This ensures that there is a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the executive directors.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees in respect of the design of the executive director Remuneration Policy, although the Committee will keep this under review.
