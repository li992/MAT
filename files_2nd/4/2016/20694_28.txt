76 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Corporate governance Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration Introduction This Annual Report on Remuneration details how the Remuneration Policy as approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM was implemented in 2016, and sets out how the Remuneration Policy will be implemented in 2017.

The chart to the left illustrates the potential outcomes of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors based on three different scenarios.
The assumptions on which the scenarios are based are set out below: Scenario Assumptions Minimum Consists of base salary, benefits, market adjusted allowance and pension.
A single years maximum savings under Sharesave is also assumed.
1 In line with expectations An on-target bonus under the AIP and a threshold level of vesting under the PSP are achieved.
1 Maximum Based on the maximum opportunity being achieved.
1 Excluding share price appreciation and dividends.
Non-Executive Directors Fees to be paid to the Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 87.
The only change to fees in 2017 effective 1 April 2017 is an increase in the fee paid to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee from 15k p. a. to 20k p. a., which brings this fee into line with the fees paid to the Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees.
78 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Corporate governance Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Single total figure table: Executive Directors audited The following table sets out the total remuneration paid to the Executive Directors for the financial years ending 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
Further detail is provided at the bottom of the page.
In addition, the following items have been included under Taxable benefits: - Awards made under the SIP.
Consistent with other employees, a one-off award was made under the SIP to both Executive Directors following IPO in recognition of their contribution to the business.
This has been valued at the share price on the date of grant 2.41 and included in the 2015 figure.
These awards vested immediately on grant and are included in the share interests table on page 88.
- The write-off of loans to Phillip Monks and James Mack of 108,317 and 31,279 respectively in 2015.
These loans were made originally to settle the tax payable by each of the Directors in respect of equity incentives awarded to them prior to the IPO.
- Participation by Phillip Monks and James Mack in the Sharesave Plan.
Where the average share price over Q4 in the year of grant is higher than the option price, participation is included under Taxable benefits.
On this basis, participation in the 2016 invitation is included above.
Further detail can be found on page 85.
2 The Market adjusted allowance became payable following IPO.
3 The Annual bonus figure represents the value of the total bonus.
A proportion of the bonus will be deferred into shares under the DSP.
60% of the bonus earned in respect of 2016 will be deferred.
For 2015, this was at a blended rate based on 15% being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned in the period up to IPO, and 60% being deferred into shares for the part of the bonus earned for the period following IPO.
See page 79 for detail on the bonus outcome.
4 The Directors held certain shares pre-IPO which converted into ordinary shares on IPO.
The reported gains have been calculated on the market value of shares held at IPO 1.92 less the actual cost of any shares bought pre-IPO, regardless of whether such shares were acquired as an investment or an incentive, and included in the 2015 figure.
As part of the IPO, the Directors were subject to certain lock-up arrangements in respect of their shares, as set out in the IPO Prospectus.
The lock-up in respect of two-thirds of each Directors holding expired on the first anniversary of the IPO, whilst the remaining one-third expired on the second anniversary of the IPO.
Fixed pay for Executive Directors Base salary The Remuneration Committee considered benchmarking data in respect of the base salaries of the Executive Directors, and determined that the increases set out in the table below were appropriate.
The increases, which will take effect from 1 April 2017, are in line with the Remuneration Policy and are consistent with the average level of increase of 2.5% awarded to employees in the Group generally.
At 1 April 2017 % increase At 1 April 2016 Phillip Monks 525,313 2.5% 512,500 James Mack 367,719 2.5% 358,750 Taxable benefits The taxable benefits received by the Executive Directors in 2016 included private medical insurance family cover, a car allowance and critical illness insurance.
No changes to taxable benefits are proposed to be made during 2017.
79 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Market adjusted allowance The market adjusted allowance is calculated as a percentage of base salary.
As reported last year, with effect from 1 April 2016 the level paid to the CFO was increased from 15% to 20%, aligning it with that paid to the CEO.
Further information on the market adjusted allowance can be found in the Remuneration Policy table on page 94.
No changes to the market adjusted allowance are proposed in 2017.
Pensions Pension contributions for the Executive Directors are paid at a rate of 8%, consistent with employees in the Group generally.
This may be paid into a personal pension arrangement or paid as a cash supplement reduced for the impact of employers NICs.
Throughout 2016, the CEO chose to receive a cash supplement.
Prior to 1 April 2016, a contribution of 6% was paid into a stakeholder pension for the CFO maintained at 6% in line with the CFOs wishes.
As reported last year, with effect from 1 April 2016, the CFO elected to be paid a cash supplement of 8% less employers NICs and he ceased to receive contributions into a stakeholder pension.
The Company does not intend to make any changes to pension contributions in 2017.
Annual Incentive Plan AIP 2016 AIP outturn The AIP is based on a balanced scorecard of financial, non-financial and personal measures.
The Remuneration Committee sets stretching performance targets at the start of the performance period.
Whilst the performance of each element is assessed against the targets at the end of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee also considers total bonus outcomes within the context of both the Companys overall performance and personal performance to ensure that they are fair.
The table below sets out the performance measures and outcomes for the 2016 AIP.
The maximum bonus opportunity for both the CEO and the CFO was 125% of base salary.
The actual percentage of the maximum bonus awarded was 79.7% for the CEO and 80.7% for the CFO.
2016 AIP: performance assessment Phillip Monks James Mack Measures Weighting % Actual % Weighting % Actual % Financial 50 35.9 50 36.2 Risk 15 11.3 15 12 Customer 7.5 7.5 7.5 7.5 People 7.5 5 7.5 6 Strategic personal 20 20 20 19 Total 100 79.7 100 80.7 Based on the assessment of the performance measures above, actual bonuses paid to the Executive Directors are set out below.
60% of the bonus awarded will be deferred into shares and held under the DSP.
The deferred element of the bonus will take the form of a nil-cost option award, which will become exercisable by the Directors in equal amounts over the three years following the award, subject to continued employment and malus and clawback provisions.
The number of shares to be awarded will be based on the Companys average share price over the three-day period prior to grant and will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts.

The key performance outcomes which were taken into account in agreeing the outcomes were as follows: 2016 AIP: non-financial performance measures and outcomes % of maximum Performance Phillip James metric Outcomes Monks Mack Risk A full assessment of the risk appetite, risk management, governance and control frameworks operating 75% 80% across the Group was undertaken by the Chief Risk Officer and discussed with the Risk Committee before formal presentation to the Remuneration Committee.
This included adherence to established risk appetite limits and triggers, risk events and findings raised in the course of reviews by second-line risk teams and the Group Internal Audit function.
Consideration was also given to risk culture and risk awareness.
Overall, it was recognised that the risk performance met expectations when measured against existing risk appetite and metrics, the operating environment and the current maturity of the organisation.
Both the CEO and the CFO in conjunction with the Executive team had been strong advocates of setting the tone from the top, and a transparent and open culture was promoted.
This had manifested itself in general trends of risk events being raised proactively and in a timely manner: management responsiveness to risk issues: and, consequently, appropriate resolution.
Customer The overarching goal for remuneration purposes was to put the customer at the heart of everything we 100% 100% do.
This objective was an assessment which included both numeric and more behavioural assessment.
NPS, or Net Promoter Score, is a customer loyalty metric which is widely used across a number of industries, and is one of the key performance indicators of the Groups strategic objective to be customer-driven see pages 14 and 36 for more information.
In 2016, the customer NPS improved by 14 which was well ahead of the target for the year.
The Remuneration Committee also took into account the CFOs leadership of the Savings business, where a strong performance resulted in the increase in the Savings NPS score exceeding the target set for 2016.
The Voice of the Customer programme was launched to enable the Group to collect customer feedback in real time and respond to it.
The programme was championed by the Executive Directors.
Other indicators of customer views were also considered, for example customer complaints, which were maintained within accepted tolerances, and upheld rates, which remained below industry averages.
81 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices % of maximum Performance Phillip James metric Outcomes Monks Mack 67% 80% People The Big Conversation programme was launched, in part to replace the Best Companies to Work For survey as the principal means of evaluating employee engagement and to provide more meaningful insights from people.
This has enabled richer feedback to be obtained from employees, with a view to better connecting culture with strategy.
Employee engagement is a key performance indicator of the Groups strategic objective to deliver simply.
Whilst the mechanism for measuring employee engagement changed in 2016 in line with the Big Conversation approach and was not directly comparable to previous years, the Remuneration Committee noted that internal engagement surveys had confirmed a strong level of employee connection to Aldermore.
Senior management succession planning is continuing to evolve and the mapping of current and future talent requirements has developed further during the year.
This translated into the movement of a number of employees into roles that will enable them to broaden their skills and experience, with a view to stepping up in to a more senior role in due course.
In addition, development plans were formalised for the senior management team.
Internal management development programmes continue to be promoted, and strong sponsorship and support from the Executive Committee has been instrumental in the programmes resulting in internal promotions.
During 2016, the CFO sponsored the Groups main internal development programme the Next Generation Leaders programme.
The targets for the risk customer and people measures are internal to the Group and commercially sensitive, and are likely to remain so.
They are not, therefore, disclosed.
The Executive Directors personal objectives are focused on the delivery of the Groups strategy and, in the case of the CFO, the continued evolution of the Finance functions falling within his remit.
Following consideration of achievements against the objectives which were set at the beginning of 2016, the Remuneration Committees view was that both the CEO and the CFO had performed strongly against all of their objectives and confirmed that awards of 100% and 95% of maximum respectively should be made.
Examples of achievements against personal objectives are set out below: 2016 AIP: personal objectives Achievements Phillip A significant year of macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory developments demanded a more flexible approach to Monks planning, which has been driven by the CEO.
A re-articulation of the Groups strategy has led to a renewed focus on three strategic priorities as detailed on page 14.
During the year, the Executive Committee was strengthened through the appointment of three new members who bring a wealth of experience in their respective fields and who will each help drive the business forward.
The CEO has supported the delivery of key strategic projects.
This included upgrades to two of the Group's core customer platforms.
James The CFO oversaw delivery of the project to raise 60m additional Tier 2 capital in October 2016, thereby strengthening Mack the balance sheet.
A strong performance was delivered across Financial Planning, Financial Control and Capital Management with improvements made to internal structures and resources to provide improved insight and an enhanced control environment to support business decisions.
Under the leadership of the CFO, it has been a strong year for the Treasury function.
A new asset liability management system has been implemented with improved reporting and analysis capabilities to drive business performance in areas such as cashflow forecasting.
82 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Corporate governance Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued 2017 AIP As set out in the statement from the Remuneration Committee Chair on page 75, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the balanced scorecard of performance measures to apply for the 2017 performance year.
Whilst retaining the broad overall split between financial and non-financial performance measures, some changes to the underlying performance measures and weightings were agreed and, as a result, the balanced scorecard will be structured as set out below.
A key driver of the changes to the underlying performance metrics is to ensure that they are more representative of our core KPIs, thereby strengthening the link between pay and performance.
The alignment of the performance metrics with our KPIs is shown below, whilst further information on the KPIs can be found on page 15.
2017 AIP: performance measures CEO and CFO Financial measures Core KPI Performance weighting Profit before tax Profit before tax 15% Net interest margin Profit before tax 10% Net loan growth Net loans 10% Return on equity CET1 ratio 5% Cost income ratio Cost income ratio 5% Cost of risk Cost of risk 5% Non-financial measures Risk 20% Customer 20% People 10% The Remuneration Committee has set stretching financial targets against budget, and has agreed a suite of underlying metrics in respect of the non-financial performance measures.
An evaluation of each Directors individual performance against the relevant overarching enterprise-wide objective will also be taken into account in assessing the outturn of the non-financial measures.
The targets are currently commercially sensitive but will be disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts on a similar basis to those for 2016 in this report.
Long-term incentives PSP: Awards made in 2016 During the year, awards were granted to the Executive Directors under the PSP in the form of nil-cost options with a face value at the time of the award of 135% of base salary.
Full details of the awards made are included on page 84.
"Half of each award is subject to a relative Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"" condition whilst the other half of the award is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share ""EPS"" targets."
Both performance conditions are measured over performance periods which end on 31 December 2018.
Details of the performance measures and targets are set out on the next page.
83 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices 2016 PSP: performance measures Relative TSR Growth in TSR will be measured against a comparator group comprising the companies making up the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts and the Company itself.
It is measured from 1 January 2016 using the Companys one-month average immediately prior to 1 January 2016 as the start point to the end of 2018 using the Companys one-month average to 31 December 2018 as the end point.
The Remuneration Committee selected relative TSR as a performance measure as it is a key indicator of returns to investors, thereby aligning interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the FTSE 350 is the most appropriate comparator group as it is more reflective of market performance than a single market grouping or a comparator group of competitors.
Details of the targets for relative TSR are set out below: Ranking % of award which vests Below median 0% Median 10% Between median and upper quartile On a straight line basis between 10% and 50% Upper quartile or above 50% EPS EPS will be measured using adjusted undiluted EPS.
The Remuneration Committee selected EPS as a performance measure as it is a key internal measure of profitability.
Details of the targets for EPS are set out below: Target % of award which vests Below 30p 0% 30p 10% Between 30p and 37p On a straight line basis between 10% and 50% 37p or above 50% In order to satisfy itself that the vesting of any awards is appropriate, the Remuneration Committee has set additional underpin performance conditions which must be met.
For both performance measures, the result achieved must appropriately reflect the performance of the Company taking into account such factors as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate: and the result achieved must be consistent with the Companys risk appetite.
Additionally, in respect of TSR, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the Companys achieved TSR is reflective of the Companys underlying financial performance.
PSP: Pre-IPO Awards vesting outcome The Pre-IPO Awards granted to the Executive Directors at IPO were subject to a performance period which ended on 31 December 2016.
In order to achieve a threshold level of vesting, growth of at least 20% p. a. in absolute TSR was required.
At the end of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee assessed TSR performance over the performance period and determined that the minimum level of performance had not been met.
The Pre-IPO Awards therefore lapsed in full.
PSP: Awards to be made in the current year 2017 In 2017, the Remuneration Committee intends to make PSP awards to Phillip Monks and James Mack with a face value at the time of the award of 135% of base salary.
The awards will be made on the same basis as in 2016.
On that basis, half of the award will be subject to a relative TSR condition with 20% of that part vesting at median versus the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts and the Company itself rising to full vesting of that part for upper quartile performance.
The other half of the award will again be subject to an EPS scale with 20% of that part vesting at an EPS of 33p rising to full vesting of that part for an EPS of 41p.

For awards made in 2016, the average middle market quotation over the three-day period 16-18 March 2016 227.73p was used to calculate face value.
The relevant price was multiplied by the maximum number of shares that would vest if all performance measures and targets were met in full.
Actual value at vesting will depend on actual share price at the time of vesting, and any dividend equivalents if any payable on vested shares.

87 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors fees The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee, whilst the Non-Executive Directors may receive further fees to reflect Board Committee or additional responsibilities.
The current fee structure was agreed at the time that the Board was put together in preparation for IPO on the basis of a benchmarking exercise against financial services companies of a similar size.
The fees are reviewed by the Board in the case of the Non-Executive Directors and the Remuneration Committee in the case of the Chairman on an annual basis.
The most recent review concluded that, with the exception of the fee paid to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, the fees remained appropriate, and no increases would be made in 2017.
With effect from 1 April 2017, the fee paid to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee will be brought into line with that paid to the Chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees 20k p. a.. Current fees are set out below: Non-Executive Directors Fees Role p. a.

88 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Corporate governance Remuneration Report Annual Report on Remuneration continued Other Shareholdings In order to further align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Company has implemented share ownership guidelines.
The guidelines require the Executive Directors to build up a specified level of shareholding expressed as a percentage of base salary within five years of the guidelines being implemented or within five years of appointment, if later.
The required level of shareholding is 200% of base salary, using the current share price from time to time, for each of the Executive Directors.
Under the guidelines, the Executive Directors are expected to retain all of the ordinary shares vesting under any of the employee share plans, after any disposals for the payment of applicable taxes and any acquisition costs, until they have achieved the required level of shareholding.
Vested awards not subject to any performance condition but subject to a holding period count as ownership towards the guidelines after deducting the tax which would be due if the shares were released on that date.
The guidelines also prohibit the Executive Directors from hedging or offering as collateral any shares which are unvested or unexercised under any employee share plans, and any shares which count towards meeting the guidelines.
Other shares owned by Executive Directors and their connected persons also count towards the share ownership guidelines.
Both Executive Directors have met the guideline levels.

It is intended that the Remuneration Policy will operate until the 2019 AGM unless any significant changes are proposed in the interim.
No changes are proposed to the Remuneration Policy this year, and a shareholder vote on it will not therefore be required at the 2017 AGM.
The full Remuneration Policy, as approved by shareholders, can be found on pages 95 to 103 of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts on the Companys website at www.
co. uk The Remuneration Policy is based on the following key principles: Aligned to the long-term success of the Group The remuneration framework is structured to align remuneration, and in particular performance-related remuneration, with the long-term interests of shareholders.
Incentive plans should be designed such that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking.
Competitive but not excessive The Group recognises that its long-term success is closely linked to its ability to attract and retain high-calibre individuals who can drive the delivery of its business strategy.
However, this should be balanced with ensuring that remuneration is appropriate to the role, responsibilities, experience and performance of the individual, and is not excessive.
Appropriate and balanced proportion of variable pay Total remuneration should balance both fixed and variable elements, whilst variable pay should be balanced between both shortterm and long-term incentives with an emphasis on achieving sustainable business results.
Simplicity and transparency in the design and communication The key to an effective remuneration structure is that the link between incentives and performance is clear, well-communicated and easily understood.
To see how the Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2016, please refer to the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 76 to 89.

With this in mind, the starting point for the Remuneration Committee in setting a remuneration package for a new Executive Director will be to structure a package in accordance with the Remuneration Policy, based on the individuals knowledge and experience.
Consistent with the DRR Regulations, the caps contained within the Remuneration Policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, although the Remuneration Committee does not currently envisage exceeding these caps in practice.
Notwithstanding the general approach set out above, the Remuneration Committee recognises that, when recruiting externally in particular, it may be necessary to compensate an individual to ensure that they are remunerated effectively.
The table below sets out areas where the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion in order to achieve this.
This may arise in particular in relation to bonus and incentive plans given that variable performance-related pay is widely used in the financial services industry to incentivise senior management.
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on terms in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy at that time.
Recruitment Remuneration Policy Remuneration Committee discretion Relocation expenses For external and internal appointments, certain relocation expenses may be provided and may be paid over more than one financial year.
As set out in the Remuneration Policy, this may be up to a maximum of 100% of base salary p. a. over and above the general policy on payment of benefits.
AIP The AIP will operate as detailed in the Remuneration Policy including the maximum award levels.
In the year of appointment, at the Remuneration Committees discretion, the terms of that years AIP and the performance measures will normally be varied to reflect the part year worked.
For an internal appointment, any award under the AIP in respect of the individuals prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
No element of AIP will be guaranteed, unless in the year of joining a guaranteed element is used as part of a buy-out of awards forfeited on leaving the previous employer see below for further detail.
PSP The PSP will operate as detailed in the Remuneration Policy including the maximum award levels.
For an internal appointment, in line with the AIP, PSP awards in respect of the individuals prior role may either continue on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
Buy-out awards For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional awards in connection with the recruitment to buy out awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a previous employer.
Although these are not subject to a formal cap, the Group will not pay more than is necessary, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, to fairly compensate for awards forfeited on leaving the previous employer to join the Group and will in all cases seek to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing AIP and PSP.
In some cases however, it may be necessary to make such buy-out awards on different terms to reflect better the structure of the awards being bought out.
All buy-outs, whether under the AIP, PSP or otherwise, will take account of the service obligations and performance requirements for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving their previous employer.
The Remuneration Committee will seek to make buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect of service and performance.
However, the Remuneration Committee may choose to relax this requirement in certain cases, for example: where the service and or performance requirements are materially completed, or where such factors are, in the Remuneration Committees view, reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount to the face value of the awards forfeited, or where necessary to retain compliance with regulatory requirements, such as CRD IV.
