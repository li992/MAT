Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Governance 104 DIRECTORS REMUNER A TION REPOR T In this section, we describe the Directors Remuneration Policy and how our directors were paid during 2016.
Annual Statement On behalf of the Remuneration Committee referred to in the rest of this report as the committee, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2016.
2016 was a year of significant strategic change with the announcement of the managed separation of the Group in March.
This required a complete review of our remuneration policy, with particular emphasis on aligning our incentive plans to the strategy.
There continues to be significant government and media focus on executive pay which the committee monitors carefully.
We remain committed to ensuring there is strong alignment with shareholder interests in the pay arrangements for our executives and to operate with complete transparency in discharging our duties Danuta Gray through the managed separation process.
