As part of the February 2015 report, Trust Associates remarked that generally fees should be increased by a moderate amount each year, rather than being held steady for a few years with the need to then increase them sharply to bring them back into line.
A further recommendation was that the Remuneration Committee Chris Russell should review how the sector is developing each year, including a Remuneration Committee Chairman review of the fees paid in the sector by competitors, and make decisions on fee levels in light of then-current information.
17 May 2016 In accordance with Trust Associates recommendations, the Committee reviewed board remuneration across the sector during the year and this formed the basis of the following Directors Remuneration Policy Report recommendations for routine business for the 2016-17 year: The Remuneration Committee receives independent professional advice in respect of the Directors roles, responsibilities and fees as n Directors fees to be increased to 41,000 p. a. and when appropriate.

Following the changes during the year, in anticipation of Mr J Hallams retirement on 30 June 2016, the roles are now split and Mr F Nelson is the SID and Mrs S Evans is the Audit committee chair.
As last year the fees approved proposed relate to the roles performed, and not to individuals per se.
In light of the changes in roles resulting from succession planning in the year ended 31 March 2016, Directors accrued a blended entitlement to the fees attributable to the above roles, pro rated based on the time each Director performed in respect of each position, as set out below: Total remuneration paid Director YE 2016 Mr I Russell 41,958 Mrs S Evans 47,083 Mrs S Farnon 41,167 Mr J Hallam 42,333 Mr F Nelson 38,667 Mr G Picken 61,875 Mr C Russell 38,917 TOTAL 312,000 As in previous years, should the Company require Directors to work on specific corporate actions such as further equity raising other than scrip dividend alternative or tap issues, then this is remunerated appropriately as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
In the year to 31 March 2016, apart from additional fees for the Luxembourg subsidiaries work undertaken by Mrs S Evans and Mr C Russell as noted above, no such additional fees were paid.
The proposed recommendation for the year ended 31 March 2017 is for aggregate Directors fees including the LuxCo fee to be approximately 0.0151% of the Companys market capitalisation as at 31 March 2016.
The comparative figure for the year to 31 March 2016 was 0.0159% which Trust Associates confirmed was, in percentage terms, towards the low end of the range for investment companies.
The total fees paid to Directors in the year were within the annual fee cap of 450,000, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 21 July 2015.
The Remuneration Committee considers that this cap remains adequate at present to permit the moderate adjustments that may be necessary for subsequent years and to provide contingency for any additional fees associated with non-routine business.
Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the current financial year The Board has approved the proposed increase to the fees as recommended by the Remuneration Committee, and is seeking shareholder approval for the Directors Remuneration Policy at the AGM on 19 July 2016 with a view to implementing it back-dated to 1 April 2016.
