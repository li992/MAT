An error was made in the calculation of LTIP vesting as reported in the 2015 Annual Report.
This was identified and corrected before any payments were made so no one received more than they were due.
The error was the inclusion of one Investment Trust Hansa Peer Group Ranking which was not in the peer group for the whole of the three year period moving into the peer group in April 2014.
This meant that LTIP awards from 2011 onwards calculations of the payments were based on a group of 35 rather 100 than 34 Trusts.
This led to a higher proportion of the award vesting 75 65.02% rather than the 54.14% that was actually due.
Our ranking 50 was 15th under both calculations.
This meant a reduction in the value 25 of the LTIP award as reported in the 2015 Accounts from 438,000 to 0 379,000 for Katherine Garrett-Cox and from 229,000 to 198,000 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 for Alan Trotter.
This error had not been not identified by our managers Peer Group Ranking when they prepared the calculation and was not identified by our Auditors in the course of their audit.
We commissioned an external review of the process to prevent a recurrence.
The LTIP awards reported this year have been subject to significant additional scrutiny.
