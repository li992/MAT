Inaddition, Adrian Jackson, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests information and analysis from external advisers as required.
Rosemary Martin, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and acts as secretary to the Committee.
External advisers The Remuneration Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate.
The appointed advisers, Willis Towers Watson, were selected through a thorough process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and were appointed by the Committee in 2007.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has direct access to the advisers as and when required, and the Committee determines the protocols by which the advisers interact with management in support of the Committee.
The advice and recommendations of the external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member.
Advisers attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.
Willis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants.
Willis Towers Watson has confirmed that it adheres to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and objective.
