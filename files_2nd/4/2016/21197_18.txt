Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Governance Directors remuneration report continued 109 SINGLE TOTAL FIGURES OF REMUNERATION FOR 2016 The table below sets out the total remuneration for 2016 and 2015 for each of our EDs.
2 The benets disclosure includes the cost, where relevant, of private medical insurance, life insurance, accommodation, travel and car benets.
In the case ofMark and Andy this also includes benets resulting from the UK HMRC tax-advantaged Save As You Earn SAYE plan, and for Andy the UK HMRC tax-advantaged share incentive plan All Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP, in which they participate on the same basis as all eligible employees.
Allnumbers disclosed include the tax charged on the benets, where applicable.
The year on year increase in the value of Marks benets results mainly from higher death in service life insurance costs, and a change during 2015 in the administration of Avivas shared car service for senior executives.
The actual carservice arrangements provided to Mark were unchanged in 2015 and 2016.
For Tom, his 2015 benets included expenditure in terms of his relocation fromthe US to the UK, which were not incurred in 2016.
3 Bonus payable in respect of the financial year including any deferred element at face value at date of award.
The deferred element is made under the Aviva Annual Bonus Plan 2011 ABP.
4 The value of the LTIP for 2016 relates to the 2014 award, which had a three-year performance period ending 31 December 2016.
41.3% of the award will vest in March 2017.
An assumed share price of 456.27 pence has been used to determine the value of the award based on the average share price over the final quarter of the 2016 financial year.
The LTIP amounts shown in last years report in respect of the LTIPs awarded in 2013 were also calculated with an assumed share price of 491.68 pence.
The actual share price at vesting was 447.01 pence, leading to a decrease in value.
5 Pension contributions consist of employer contributions into the dened contribution section of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, excluding salary exchange contributions made by the employees, plus payments in lieu of pension above the lifetime or annual allowance caps.
From 1 May 2015, EDs are eligible to participate in a dened contribution plan and receive pension contributions or a cash pension allowance from the Company of 28% of basic salary.
The cash pension allowance is payable where the annual or lifetime limits have been reached.
6 For Andy, his 2015 values only relate to his services to Aviva from 29 April 2015, whereas 2016 represents a full year.
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE TOTAL FIGURE OF REMUNERATION TABLE 2016 annual bonus outcome The Groups financial performance, together with non-financial modiers and personal performance have been used to determine ED bonuses paid in respect of 2016.
We have provided an indication of performance against the financial and non-financial metrics for 2016 in table 2.
As set out in this table, the bonuses reect a good year in a volatile market environment for the Group.
Shareholders approved increased at target and maximum annual bonus opportunities for the Group CEO as part of the Remuneration Policy adopted at the 2015 AGM.
In proposing the changes, we undertook that we would not pay more for the same performance and 2016 annual bonus outcomes reported here have been achieved against appropriately challenging hurdles.
In determining the bonus awards, the Committee took into account the wider performance of Aviva and the experience of shareholders during the year, and is satisfied that the bonus awards above are fair in the light of those considerations.
One-third of the bonus award for all EDs will be delivered in cash, with two-thirds being deferred into shares for three years.
Other items of remuneration The EDs have not received any items in the nature of remuneration other than those disclosed in table 1.
Malus and Clawback As part of the annual pay review process, the Committee has considered whether any recovery or withholding under the malus and clawback provisions of Avivas incentive plans is required by any current circumstances.
No incidents are currently subject to action under Avivas malus and clawback policy.

Given the timing of the appointment dates of our EDs, Mark and Tom are the only EDs who will receive shares under the 2014 LTIP.

LTIP is a conditional right to receive shares based on a three-year performance period, with an additional two-year holding period.
ABP represents the portion of the 2015 bonus deferred into shares for three years.
SAYE awards are savings-related options normally exercisable during the six-month period following the end of the relevant 3 or 5 year savings contract.
AESOP includes partnership, matching and dividend share awards which vest after three years.
Further details are provided at tables 13 and 15.
2 Face value for the awards granted on 29March 2016 has been calculated using the average of the middle-market closing price of an Aviva ordinary share on the three consecutive business days immediately preceding the date of the main grant, on 21 March 2016 485.00 pence.
For SAYE the option price is xed to a three day average closing middle-market price of an ordinary share of the Company, prior to invitation date, with a discount of 20% as permitted under the SAYE plan 351.00 pence.
AESOP has been calculated using the price achieved at purchase of the partnership shares 479.87 pence.
ROE targets for awards made in 2016 ROE targets determine the vesting of 50% of the LTIP award and are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return.
The 2016 targets are provided below and have been set in the context of the enlarged Group.
ROE is calculated as the IFRS profit after tax and non-controlling interest, excluding the impact of investment variances, pension scheme income charge and economic assumption changes, over average IFRS equity excluding pension scheme net surplus deficit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company.

Achievement against individual strategic objectives is also taken into account.
LTIP performance measures are chosen to provide an indication of both absolute and relative return generated for shareholders.

The clawback period runs for two years from the date of vesting or from the date of payment in the case of annual bonus awards.
Clawback was introduced in 2015 so applies to the annual bonus from 2015 paid March 2016 and the LTIP awards granted in 2015 and any future awards.
Discretions The discretions the Committee has in relation to the operation of the ABP and LTIP are set out in the plan rules.
These include but are not limited to the ability to set additional conditions and the discretion to change or waive those conditions in exceptional circumstances.
In relation to the LTIP, in accordance with its terms, the Committee has discretion in relation to vesting and in exceptional circumstances to waive or change a performance condition if anything happens which causes the Committee reasonably to consider it appropriate to do so.
Any use of the discretions will be disclosed, where relevant, in the annual report and, where appropriate be subject to consultation with Avivas shareholders.
Change in control In the event of a change in control, unless a new award is granted in exchange for an existing award, or if there is a significant corporate event like a demerger, awards under the LTIP would normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied as at the date of the change in control, and unless the Committee decides otherwise, would be pro-rated to reect the time between the start of the performance period and the change in control.
Awards under the ABP would normally vest on the date of the change in control and may vest if there is a significant corporate event.
Consistency of executive Remuneration Policy across the Group The Remuneration Policy for our EDs is designed as part of the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group.
Remuneration arrangements for employees below the EDs take account of the seniority and nature of the role, individual performance and local market practice.
The components and levels of remuneration for different employees may therefore differ from the Policy for EDs.
Any such elements are reviewed against market practice and approved in line with internal guidelines and frameworks.
Differentiation in reward outcomes based on performance and behaviour that is consistent with the Aviva values is a feature of how Aviva operates its annual bonus plan for its senior leaders and managers globally.
A disciplined approach is taken to moderation across the Company in order to recognise and reward the key contributors.
The allocation of LTIP awards also involves strong differentiation, with expected contribution and ability to collaborate effectively in implementation of the strategy driving award levels.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofce including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed i before the Policy came into effect or ii at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes payments includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION On hiring a new ED, the Committee would align the proposed remuneration package with our Remuneration Policy.
In determining the actual remuneration for a new ED, the Committee would consider the package in totality, taking into account elements such as the likely contribution of the individual, local market benchmarks, remuneration practice, and the existing remuneration of other senior executives.
The Committee would ensure any arrangements agreed would be in the best interests of Aviva and its shareholders.
It would seek not to pay more than necessary to secure the right candidate.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to buyout remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so, the Committee would take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which it was paid e. g. cash or shares and the timeframe of awards.
The Committee considers that a buyout award is a significant investment in human capital by Aviva, and any buyout decision will involve careful consideration of the contribution that is expected from the individual.
Buyout awards would be awarded on a like for like basis compared to remuneration being forfeited, and would be capped to reect the value being forfeited.
The maximum level of variable pay which could be awarded to a new ED, excluding any buyouts, would be in line with the Policy set out above and would therefore be no more than 550% of basic salary for the Group CEO 200% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant and 500% of basic salary for other EDs 150% of basic salary Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Governance Directors remuneration report continued 123 annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant.
All other elements of remuneration will also be in line with the Policy set out above.
Should the Company have any prior commitments outside of this Policy in respect of an employee promoted internally to an ED position, the Committee may continue to honour these for a period of time.
Where an ED is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions.
Similarly, if an ED is appointed following Avivas acquisition of, or merger with, another company, legacy terms and conditions may be honoured.
On hiring a new NED, the Committee would align the remuneration package with the Remuneration Policy for NEDs, outlined in table 20, including fees and travel benets.
ILLUSTRATION OF THE POLICY The charts below illustrate how much EDs could earn under different performance scenarios in one financial year: Minimum basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension and benets, no bonus and no vesting of the LTIP Target basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension, benets, and: A bonus of 100% and an LTIP of 300% of basic salary with notional LTIP vesting at 50% of maximum for the Group CEO: A bonus of 100% and an LTIP of 225% of basic salary with notional LTIP vesting at 50% of maximum for the CFO: and A bonus of 100% and an LTIP of 225% of basic salary with notional LTIP vesting at 50% of maximum for the CEO UK.
Maximum basic salary, pension or cash in lieu of pension, benets, and: A bonus of 200% and an LTIP of 300% of basic salary with notional LTIP vesting at maximum for the Group CEO: A bonus of 150% and an LTIP of 225% of basic salary with notional LTIP vesting at maximum for the CFO: and A bonus of 150% and an LTIP of 225% of basic salary with notional LTIP vesting at maximum for the CEO UK.

Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2016 Directors remuneration report continued 124 EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT ED employment contracts and NED letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered ofce during normal hours of business, and at the place of the Companys 2017 AGM from 10.45am on 10 May 2017 until the close of the meeting.
The key employment terms and conditions of the current EDs, and those who served during the year, as stipulated in their employment contracts, are set out in the table below.
20 EXECUTIVE DIREC TORS CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT Provision Policy Notice period By the ED 6 months.
By the Company 12 months, rolling.
No notice or payment in lieu of notice to be paid where the Company terminates for cause.
Termination payment Pay in lieu of notice up to a maximum of 12 months basic salary.
Any payment is subject to phasing and mitigation requirements.
An ED would be expected to mitigate the loss of office by seeking alternative employment.
Any payments in lieu of notice would be reduced, potentially to zero, by any salary received from such employment.
Remuneration and benefits The operation of the annual bonus and LTIP is at the Companys discretion.
Expenses Reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in accordance with their duties.
Car allowance A cash car allowance is received, as varied from time to time.
Holiday entitlement 30 working days plus public holidays.
Private medical insurance Private medical insurance is provided for the ED and their family.
The ED can choose to opt out of this benefit or take a lower level of cover.
However, no payments are made in lieu of reduced or no cover.
Other benefits Other benefits include private medical insurance and participation in the Companys staff pension scheme.
Sickness 100% of basic salary for 52 weeks, and 75% thereafter for a further 52 weeks.
Non-compete During employment and for six months after leaving less any period of garden leave without the prior written consent of the Company.
Director: Date current contract commenced: Contract dates Mark Wilson 1 January 2013 Tom Stoddard 28 April 2014 Andy Briggs 13 April 2015 POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE There are no pre-determined ED special provisions for compensation for loss of ofce.
The Committee has the ability to exercise its discretion on the final amount actually paid.
Any compensation would be based on basic salary, pension entitlement and other contractual benets during the notice period, or a payment made in lieu of notice, depending on whether the notice is worked.
Where notice of termination of a contract is given, payments to the ED would continue for the period worked during the notice period.
Alternatively, the contract may be terminated and phased monthly payments made in lieu of notice for, or for the balance of, the 12 months notice period.
During this period, EDs would be expected to mitigate their loss by seeking alternative employment.
Payments in lieu of notice would be reduced by the salary received from any alternative employment, potentially to zero.
The Company would typically make a reasonable contribution towards an EDs legal fees in connection with advice on the terms of their departure.
There is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus for the year in which loss of ofce occurs.
The Committee may determine that an ED may receive a pro rata bonus in respect of the period of employment during the year loss of ofce occurs based on an assessment of performance.
Where an ED leaves the Company by reason of death, disability or ill health, or any other reason determined by the Committee, there may be a payment of a pro rata bonus for the relevant year at the discretion of the Committee.
The treatment of leavers under our ABP and LTIP is determined by the rules of the relevant plans.
Good leaver status under these plans would be granted in the event of, for example, the death of an ED, or their departure on ill health grounds.
Good leaver status for other leaving reasons is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individuals departure, but would typically include planned retirement.
In circumstances where good leaver status has been granted, awards may still be subject to malus and clawback in the event that inappropriate conduct of the ED is subsequently discovered post departure.
If good leaver status is not granted, all outstanding awards will lapse.
In the case of LTIPs, where the Committee determines EDs to be good leavers, vesting is normally based on the extent to which performance conditions have been met at the end of the relevant performance period, and the proportion of the award that vests is pro-rated for the time from the date of grant to final date of service unless the Committee decides otherwise.
Any decision not to apply this would only be made in exceptional circumstances, and would be fully disclosed.
It is not the practice to allow such treatment.

The Committee reviews levels of basic salary increases for other employees and executives based in the UK.
It reviews changes in overall bonus pool funding and long-term incentive grants.
The Committee does not directly consult with employees on pay issues but it does consider feedback from sources including the employee opinion survey.
The Committee also takes into account information provided by the people function and external advisers Its ongoing dialogue with shareholders.
It seeks shareholder views and takes them into account when any significant changes are being proposed to remuneration arrangements and when formulating and implementing Remuneration Policy.
For example, during 2014 and continuing in 2015, the Committee has had detailed engagement with our largest shareholders to discuss amendments to targets for existing LTIP awards and 2015 annual bonus plan following the acquisition of FLG NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The table below, sets out details of our Remuneration Policy for NEDs.
