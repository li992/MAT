The extent to which the awards vested and the value included in the single figure of remuneration table as a result is set out below.

On exercise of the option, the number of shares in respect of which the LTIP can be exercised will be reduced to reflect any gain made on the exercise of the option.
Accordingly, the value of the option is disregarded for the purposes of this calculation.
The value of the shares is calculated by reference to the price of a share on 2 March 2017, being 11.54p.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, each of Messrs Muir and Pegler is entitled to a further benefit by reference to dividends paid over the period from grant to vest, amounting to 76,499 in the case of D W Muir and 48,941 in the case of M Pegler.
com | Stock Code HILS Governance Report 71 Total pension entitlements Under his pension arrangement, as an active member, D W Muirs pension benefit was based upon an accrual of 1 30th of the earnings cap applying prior to 6 April 2006 and increased in line with the rules of the Scheme for each year of pensionable service calculated from 1 October 1998.
Following cessation of his defined benefit scheme active membership and future accrual D W Muir has, with effect from 1 November 2011, been in receipt of a salary supplement of 25% of his basic salary in lieu of any form of pension contribution and as compensation for his becoming a deferred member of the defined benefit scheme.
D W Muirs deferred pension is subject to statutory increases in line with inflation.
The details of D W Muirs pension accrued in the defined benefit scheme are shown below: Accrued pension at 31 December 2016 126,297 Transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2016 4,452,000 Change in accrued pension of 2015 excluding increase for inflation nil Normal retirement date 6 July 2020 The increase in the transfer value calculated for D W Muir from 3,617,000 as at 31 December 2015 is mainly due to a change in market conditions between 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2016 i. e. a reduction in corporate bond yields which has reduced the discount rate assumption and an increase in inflation expectations which has increased the inflation assumptions used.
The increase is also partly due to D W Muir now being one year closer to retirement, leading to an increase in the transfer value due to the unwinding of the discount rate.
As noted last year for the 2015 year end accounts, benefit accrual ceased in 2011 and D W Muir received a cash supplement amount in lieu of company pension contributions.
As such, D W Muir has not had any further benefit accrual within the DB scheme in 2016.
Any inflationary increases that have occurred over the year are in line with statutory requirements and as such, these increases have: already been accrued by D W Muir: already been funded for in the Executive DB Scheme: and already had the associated cost of accrual reported in the Groups accounts in previous years under IAS19.
In addition, these Regulations also require information on the aggregate pension input amount across all pension schemes in which the Director accrues benefits, calculated using a specific method, broadly in line with Section 229 of the Finance Act 2004 a for the last 5 financial years ultimately increasing to the last 10 years.
The figures are: Pension input amount Year Ending 000s 31 12 2016 nil 31 12 2015 nil 31 12 2014 nil 31 12 2013 nil 31 12 2012 nil 31 12 2011 99 31 12 2010 26 31 12 2009 67 As D W Muir ceased accrual in the Executive scheme during 2011, the pension input amounts in respect of the scheme for the years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013, 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015 are nil.
Pension contributions D W Muir receives a cash payment in lieu of any pension contribution, equal to 25% of his base salary amounting to 119,625 for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: 116,125.
M Pegler receives a cash payment in lieu of any pension contribution, equal to 25% of his base salary amounting to 80,125 for the year ended 31 December 2016 2015: 74,300.
Other than as stated above, there are no other pension arrangements in place for Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee intends to operate the same pension provision for 2017 that was operated in 2016. www.

Such appointments are seen as a way in which Executive Directors can gain a broader business experience and, in turn, benefit the Company.
Currently, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director do not hold any external Non-executive Directorships.
Service contracts and loss of office payments The Companys policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, the Company and shareholders.
In the case of termination by the Company the Director will be given twelve months notice, including where there is a change of control.
The Director will give not less than six months notice, except where there is a change of control when it will be ninety days.
Where a Director receives a payment in lieu of notice this will include base salary and benefits, to which the Executive Director is entitled including any bonus accrued up until the date of termination notwithstanding that the date of termination may be prior to the date the bonus is actually paid.
The Remuneration Committee also has discretion to incorporate payments under the performance-linked elements of the package under good leaver scenarios.
More details can be found in the Companys Remuneration Policy on the Companys website.

Any change to these fees will be approved by the Board as a whole, following a recommendation from the Chief Executive.
In December 2016, the Board approved a 3% increase in the base fees as from 1 January 2017 and, having benchmarked other fees, increased these to 7,500.
