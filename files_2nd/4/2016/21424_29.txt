Directors remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report The symbol by a heading indicates that the information in that section has been audited.
This part of the report, the annual remuneration report, sets out the remuneration out-turns for 2016 and how these relate to our performance in the year and details of the operation of our policy for 2017.
Please be aware that following a scheme of arrangement on 13 April 2016 the parent company of the Beazley group changed from Beazley Ireland Holdings plc formerly Beazley plc to Beazley plc formerly Swift No.
The remuneration disclosed for 2016 within this report are for the directors services to both of the respective parent companies of the Beazley group and to theBeazley group as a whole.
The remuneration disclosed for 2015 is for the directors services to the parent company Beazley Ireland Holdings plc formerly Beazley plc and to the Beazley group as a whole.
Remuneration principles The remuneration committee has oversight of the remuneration policy.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The main aim of the policy is to ensure that management and staff are remunerated fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel.
We believe that: performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff and should be structured to ensure that executives interests are aligned with those of shareholders: individual rewards should reflect the group objectives but be dependent on the profitability of the group and should be appropriately balanced against risk considerations: the structure of packages should support meritocracy, an important part of Beazleys culture: reward potentials should be market-competitive: and executives pay should include an element of downside risk.
Elements of remuneration Salary increases generally in line with Base salary all-employee increases Benefits include private medical insurance, Benefits travel insurance, and company car or monthly car allowance Defined contribution pension plan Pension or cash equivalent Discretionary annual bonus from an incentive Deferral into shares Annual bonus pool generated by reference to ROE and awarded Deferral into underwriting based on individual performance Three and five year LTIP time horizons Long term incentive plan Performance against long term NAVps targets LTIP awards may be forfeited if shareholding Shareholding guidelines guidelines are not met Fixed remuneration Variable remuneration 102 Beazley Annual report 2016 www.
com Governance Financial statements Risk and reward at Beazley The committee regularly reviews developing remuneration governance in the context of Solvency II remuneration guidance, other corporate governance developments and institutional shareholders guidance.
The chief risk officer reports annually to the remuneration committee on risk and remuneration as part of the regular agenda.
The committee believes the group is adopting an approach which is consistent with, and takes account of, the risk profile of the group.
We believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced in light of risk considerations, particularly taking into account the following features: Features aligned with risk considerations Share deferral A portion of bonus is normally deferred into shares for three years.
These deferred shares, together with shares awarded under the LTIP, mean that a significant portion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of shares deferred for a period of years.
Extended performance periods A portion of the LTIP has performance measured over an extended five-year period.
Shareholding requirements Executive directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 150% of salary 200% for the CEO.
LTIP awards may be forfeited if shareholding requirements are not met.
Investment in underwriting Management and underwriters may defer part of their bonuses into the Beazley staff underwriting plan, providing alignment with capital providers.
Capital commitments can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
Underwriters remuneration aligned Under the profit related bonus plan payments are aligned with the timing of profits achieved with profit achieved on the account.
For long tail accounts this may be in excess of six years.
If the account deteriorates then payouts are clawed back through adjustments to future payments.
Since 2012 profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
Clawback and malus For deferred share awards and LTIP awards from 2012 malus provisions were introduced.
For LTIP awards provisions for annual bonus from 2015 and annual bonus in respect of 2015 and onwards, clawback provisions also apply.
com Annual report 2016 Beazley 103 Directors remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report continued Single total figure of remuneration The tables below set out the single figure of total remuneration for executive directors and non-executive directors for the financial years ending 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.
For 2016 the share price at the time LTI awards were made was 143.4p for the 2012 award and 273.1p for the 2014 award, while the average share price in the last three months of 2016 was 379.9p.
This represents share price growth of 165% and 39% over the five and three year periods respectively.
2 Benefits for Adrian Cox in 2015 included an allowance of 95,335 in respect of his secondment in the US.
His secondment ended in June 2015.
3 864,006 of the 2016 single figure for Andrew Horton is a direct result of the significant share price appreciation over the LTI periods, which is directly aligned to shareholders experience.
All other executive directors have corresponding amounts in relation to share price appreciation in their single figure amounts.
4 The LTI figure for Clive Washbourn for 2015 includes the vesting of the first tranche of the MSIP award granted in 2013 to address a commercial risk to the business.
For Clive Washbourn, 1,316,643 of the 2015 single figure is also as a direct result of the significant share price appreciation, which is directly aligned to shareholders experience.
The figures in the preceding table reflect the following: salaries for 2016 increased by an average of 1.0%, which was below the average increase for all-employees: annual bonus out-turns were similar to last year, with Beazley delivering another strong performance in 2016: and LTI out-turns reflect that the LTI performance targets were met in full.
Beazley achieved sustained NAV growth of 18.19% per annum and 19.85% per annum over the three and five year periods respectively.
Beazley also achieved significant share price appreciation as detailed in the notes to the table.

com Annual report 2016 Beazley 105 Directors remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report continued Salary The committee reviews salaries annually taking into consideration any changes in role and responsibilities, development of the individual in the role and levels in comparable positions in similar financial service companies.
It also considers the performance of the group and the individual as well as the average salary increase for employees across the whole group.
Salary reviews take place in December of each year, with new salaries effective from 1 January.
For 2017, the average salary increase for executive directors was 2.0%, which was below the average salary increase across the group.
The base salaries for the executive directors in 2016 and 2017 are as set out below: 2016 2017 base salary base salary Increase % Martin L Bride 313,100 320,000 2.2% Adrian P Cox 336,200 342,500 1.9% D Andrew Horton 448,000 457,000 2.0% Neil P Maidment 336,200 342,500 1.9% Clive A Washbourn 336,200 342,500 1.9% Benefits Benefits include private medical insurance for the director and his immediate family, income protection insurance, death in service benefit at four times annual salary, travel insurance, health-club membership, season ticket and the provision of either a company car or a monthly car allowance.
Annual bonus plans The enterprise bonus plan is a discretionary plan in which all employees are eligible to participate.
The operation of a pool approach reflects Beazleys commitment to encourage teamwork at every level, which, culturally, is one of its key strengths.
The framework for determining bonuses is as follows: a percentage of profit is allocated to a bonus pool subject to a minimum group return on equity: and the percentage of profit increases for higher levels of ROE.
This ensures that outcomes are strongly aligned with shareholders interests.
A broad senior management team, beyond executive directors, participate in the bonus pool, reinforcing the companys collegiate culture.
Recommended awards to individuals from the available pool are determined by taking into account performance based on each individuals contribution to the group, including a review of performance against individual objectives.
For heads of the business divisions, divisional performance is also taken into account.
The bonus is discretionary and, rather than adopting a prescriptive formulaic framework, the committee considers wider factors in its deliberations at the end of the year, for example quality of profit and risk considerations.
In determining awards, the committee will not necessarily award the enterprise bonus pool in aggregate i. e. the sum of the bonus awards may be less than the enterprise bonus pool.
For heads of divisions a bonus may be awarded outside of the incentive pool in circumstances where the performance of a division in relation to the group is very strong.
The approach to the calculation of bonuses is aligned to shareholders interests and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE targets increase the performance gearing.
The committee reviews the bonus pool framework each year to ensure it remains appropriate, taking into account the prevailing environment, interest rates and expected investment returns, headcount and any other relevant factors.
com Governance Financial statements Performance out-turn for 2016 The process for determining 2016 bonuses is described below, including full details of the ROE targets underpinning our bonus approach along with the guideline levels which are used by the committee in its determination for each executive director.
ROE for 2016 was 18% and the overall enterprise bonus pool in which executive directors as well as other senior employees participate was calculated based on this.
At the beginning of the financial year, the risk-free return RFR was set at 1% taking into account the yield on US treasuries of two to five year maturities: the committee then considered the individual bonus award for the executive directors and other senior employees within the committees remit.
In determining the bonus award for each individual the committee took into account the individuals contribution including, where relevant, the performance of their division: and in considering individual awards in respect of executive directors for 2016, the committee had regard to the following broad framework: ROE performance hurdles Guideline illustrative bonus award as a % of maximum RFR 0% These percentages are indicative only and based on broad group results.
Within the pool framework bonus out-turns RFR 3% 12.5% may be higher or lower taking into account divisional, RFR 10% 37.5% strategic and personal performance.
RFR 17.5% 75% RFR 25% 100% The framework is used by the committee as a broad guideline rather than being formulaic and applies to a broader group of executives than board directors.
A key principle of the process is that the committee exercises its judgement in determining individual awards taking into account the individuals contribution and performance.
In particular, there may be a diverse spread of returns earned across the various divisions within the business which will be reflected in bonus out-turns achieved.
The table therefore provides full retrospective disclosure of all the group financial targets that determine the annual bonuses.
Corporate achievements that the committee took into account for the year included the following: the delivery of profit after tax of $251.0m, and the return of $132.9m to shareholders by way of dividends: delivery of growth in our gross premiums written of 6% in a market where premium rates were under increasing pressures: continued strong growth of the US business, with gross premiums written growing 20% in 2016: continued focus on attracting new talent including the strengthening of our environmental business in the US and recruitment of team to develop our international specialty lines business: continued expansion of new partnerships: and successful refinancing including raising $250m of debt giving the group capital to grow in the future.
While a number of the specific individual objectives of the executive directors are considered commercially sensitive, the following provides details of executive director achievements which the committee took into account: Martin L Bride Management of the European strategic initiative Successfully managed and implemented the re-domiciliation of the group from Ireland to the UK Investment return of 2% in a very uncertain market Active capital management including raising $250m of debt Adrian P Cox Strong growth in the core specialty lines book in respect of both income and profit Continued growth of cyber including partnerships with other insurance companies Successful realisation of opportunities in market segments such as environmental liability and healthcare liability D Andrew Horton Delivery of sustained strong performance and dividends to shareholders of $132.9m in a very competitive market Premium growth of 20% in our US business Good organic growth, attracting people to the organisation and maintaining a low turnover particularly in underwriting and claims Robust risk management in the face of a highly volatile and competitive market Neil P Maidment Achievement of strong underwriting result with a combined ratio of 89%, despite strong competitive markets continuing in 2016 Growth of 6% in overall portfolio in environment of falling rates in many classes Active role in achievements in innovation and product development Acting CEO for two months covering the CEOs sabbatical Clive A Washbourn Achievement of a combined ratio of 90% despite further steep decline in rates Acquisition and integration of Leviathan, an MGA focussing on underwater vehicles Growth in marine liability and UK cargo www.
com Annual report 2016 Beazley 107 Directors remuneration report continued Annual remuneration report continued Under the framework of the annual bonus, in respect of individual performance and achievements, awards are dependent on a profit pool and minimum level of ROE performance.

The deferral will range from 0% to 37.5% dependent on the level of bonus.
Deferred shares are generally subject to continued employment.
A portion of bonus may also be deferred under the investment in underwriting plan, and this capital can be lost if underwriting performance is poor.
No such deferral was made in 2016 see investment in underwriting on page 111 for further details.
For 2016, the portion of each directors annual bonus deferred into shares was as follows: Deferred into shares Martin L Bride 240,000 Adrian P Cox 330,000 D Andrew Horton 375,000 Neil P Maidment 294,000 Clive A Washbourn 210,000 108 Beazley Annual report 2016 www.
com Governance Financial statements Long term incentive plan LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors, senior management and selected underwriters receive awards of shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions measured over three and five years.
The key features of the plan are as follows: 50% of the award is measured after three years and 50% after five years: awards are in the form of nil-cost options with a ten-year term: and participants are expected to build a shareholding in Beazley equal to their annual award level.
For example the CEO has a shareholding requirement of 200% of salary.
Participants have three years to build this shareholding.
Given the five year performance period for 50% of the award, as well as the significant shareholding requirement and additional clawback provisions which extend to seven years from date of award, the committee considers that the LTIP is significantly aligned to long term performance.
Against that background it does not consider that further holding periods are required.
Vesting of awards is based on growth in net asset value per share NAVps, one of Beazleys key performance indicators.
The committee considers the LTIP NAVps growth targets to be very stretching, particularly taking into account that growth must be over a sustained three and five year period.
Growth in NAVps is calculated taking into account any payment of dividends by the company.
In line with our reporting to shareholders, NAVps is denominated in US dollars.
LTIP awards vesting in respect of the year The LTIP awards shown in the single total figure of remuneration for 2016 include: the second tranche of awards granted on 30 March 2012.
These are due to vest on 30 March 2017, subject to the achievement of a NAVps growth performance condition over the five years ended 31 December 2016: and t he first tranche of awards granted on 11 February 2014.
These are due to vest on 13 February 2017, subject to the achievement of a NAVps growth performance condition over the three years ended 31 December 2016.

com Governance Financial statements Dilution The share plans permit 10% of the companys issued share capital to be issued pursuant to awards under the LTIP, SAYE and option plan in a ten-year period.
The company adheres to a dilution limit of 5% in a ten year period for executive schemes.
Investment in underwriting Traditionally, Lloyds underwriters contributed their personal capital to syndicates in which they worked.
With the move to corporate provision of capital, individual membership of Lloyds has declined significantly.
The committee feels that having personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important part of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy counterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long term incentive awards.
The company has operated the Beazley staff underwriting plan for this purpose since 2004 and executive directors and other selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an element of their cash incentives at risk as capital commitments.
These capital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting performance is poor.
The group funds the capital for the plan.
The individual capital commitment is then funded through individual bonus deferral.
The aim is for individuals to fund their capital within three years.
To date over 240 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 11.8m of bonuses to the underwriting results of syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 11.1m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.

Malus and clawback Clawback provisions have operated for incentives in respect of 2015 and onwards.
Under these provisions the committee has the discretion to require clawback in certain circumstances for a defined period following payment or vesting.
Annual bonus and LTIP awards may be subject to clawback in the event of: material misstatement of results: gross misconduct: or factual error in calculating vesting or award.
Annual bonus awards may be subject to clawback for a period of three years following payment of the cash bonus.
These clawback provisions will also extend to any deferred shares delivered before the end of the three year period and to any bonus which is voluntarily deferred as notional capital into the staff underwriting plan excluding any returns on the investment which will not be subject to clawback.
LTIP awards may be subject to clawback for a period of two years following vesting.
Malus provisions have applied to the LTIP and deferred share plan for a number of years.
The committee has the discretion to reduce or withhold an award in circumstances of: conduct which justifies summary dismissal: an exceptional development which has a material adverse impact on the company, including but not limited to reputational damage, material failure of risk management, a material misstatement or any significant sanction from a government agency or regulatory authority: or where the committee considers it is necessary to comply with a law or regulatory requirement.

com Governance Financial statements Non-executive directors fees The fees of non-executive directors are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services in addition to the time commitment and responsibilities of the individual non-executive director.
No non-executive director is involved in the determination of their fees.
The board reviews fees annually.
No non-executive director participates in the groups incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Non-executive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that assesses whether the candidate brings the desired competencies and skills to the group.
The board has identified several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies may include: insurance sector expertise: asset management skills: public company and corporate governance experience: risk management skills: finance skills: and IT and operations skills.
Beazley operates across Lloyds and the US markets through a variety of legal entities and structures.
Non-executive directors, in addition to the plc board, typically sit on either one of our key subsidiary boards, namely Beazley Furlonge Ltd, our managing agency at Lloyds, or Beazley Re dac, our reinsurance company.
As a result of developments in regulation, the degree of autonomy in the operation of each board has increased in recent years, with a consequent increase in time commitment and scope of the role.
Non-executive directors service contracts Details of the non-executive directors terms of appointment are set out below: Commencement date of appointment Expires George P Blunden 1 Jan 2010 AGM 2019 Angela D Crawford-Ingle 27 Mar 2013 AGM 2019 Dennis Holt 21 Jul 2011 AGM 2018 Christine LaSala 1 Jul 2016 AGM 2020 Sir J Andrew Likierman 25 Mar 2015 AGM 2018 John P Sauerland 5 May 2016 AGM 2020 Robert A Stuchbery 11 Aug 2016 AGM 2020 Catherine M Woods 1 Jan 2016 AGM 2019 The standard approach for non-executive director appointments is that the appointment expires at the AGM following the end of the three year term, notwithstanding the fact that each non-executive director is subject to annual re-election at each AGM.

Retention shares To retain key staff.
Full vesting dependent on continued employment over six years.
Underwriter bonus plan profit related pay plan Underwriters participate in a profit related pay plan based upon the profitability of their underwriting account.
Executive directors do not participate in this plan.
The objective of the plan is to align the interests of the group and the individual through aligning an underwriters reward to the long term profitability of their portfolio.
Underwriters who have significant influence over a portfolio may be offered awards under the plan.
There is no automatic eligibility.
Profit related pay is awarded irrespective of the results of the group.
This bonus is awarded as cash and is based upon a fixed proportion of profit achieved on the relevant underwriting account as measured at three years and later.
Any movements in prior years are reflected in future year payments as the account develops after three years.
For long-tail accounts the class is still relatively immature at the three-year stage and therefore payments will be modest.
Underwriters may receive further payouts in years four, five and six and even later as the account matures.
Therefore each year they could be receiving payouts in relation to multiple underwriting years.
If the account deteriorates as it develops any payouts are clawed back through reductions in future profit related pay bonuses.
From 2012 onwards any new profit related pay plans may be at risk of forfeiture or reduction if, in the opinion of the remuneration committee, there has been a serious regulatory breach by the underwriter concerned, including in relation to the groups policy on conduct risk.
The fixed proportion is calculated based upon profit targets which are set through the business planning process and reviewed by a committee formed of executive committee members and functional specialists including the group actuary.
Underwriting risk is taken into account when setting profit targets.
In addition to profit related pay, underwriters are also eligible to receive a discretionary bonus, based upon performance, from the enterprise bonus pool.
A proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to continued employment.
Support bonus plan Employees who are not members of the executive and who do not participate in the underwriters profit related pay plan participate in a discretionary bonus pool.
This pool provides employees with a discretionary award of an annual performance bonus that reflects overall individual performance including meeting annual objectives.
A proportion of this award may also be dependent on the groups ROE and therefore allocated from the enterprise bonus pool.
