Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: The Risk Our Response Revenue and profit recognition Revenue 4,836.9 million, profit Our audit procedures included testing the controls over the monitoring before tax 112.1 million of contract performance and costs.
These controls include the review of Refer to page 81 Audit and Risk Committee Report, and page 111 contracts performance at monthly operating board review meetings, accounting policy notes 2 e and 2 f. where divisional management present details of performance and business developments to members of the Group Executive Board.
The contractual arrangements that underpin the measurement of revenue in the period can be complex, with significant judgements We selected contracts for testing based on quantitative factors for involved in the assessment of current and future financial example, those with the greatest impact on the Groups financial performance, which are relevant to the application of long term results and qualitative factors for example, major new contracts contract accounting principles.

Judgements impacting the recognition of revenue and resulting profits include, amongst others, those over: For the contracts selected, our audit procedures included the following: interpretation of contract terms and conditions: we obtained and inspected the contractual agreements to understand the contract terms and conditions that underpin the the assessment of the stage of completion, and costs to complete, revenue and the profit recognition assumptions: on long term contract arrangements: we assessed through discussion with the Group directors and the allocation of revenue to separately identifiable components inspection of correspondence with customers the judgements regarding within a contractual arrangement: the appropriate timing of the revenue recognition, including the the consideration of onerous contract conditions and associated allocation of revenue to separately identifiable components within a loss provisions: contractual arrangement: the recognition and recoverability assessments of contract related we obtained the contracts forecasts and compared the assumptions assets including those capitalised as direct incremental costs prior to underpinning them to contract terms and correspondence with service commencement.
customers, particularly on those where there are long term contract arrangements: we compared the contract forecasts to actual results to assess the performance of the contract and the historical accuracy of the forecasting: In determining whether onerous contracts should be recorded, we assessed contract profitability forecasts by analysing historic performance relative to contractual commitments over its full term.
This included challenging directors assumptions on the future costs including projected savings and the actions required to achieve these: and we challenged the recognition and recoverability of contract related assets by examining contractual terms including termination clauses and or assessing recoverability against future profitability.

The acquisitions selected included those acquisitions accounting policy note 2 j and pages 132 to 134 financial with the greatest impact on the Groups financial results, and those disclosures in note 17. containing the greatest degree of judgement.
During the year the Group acquired businesses for a total For each of these acquisitions: consideration of 417.2 million.
Judgement is required over the fair we challenged the key assumptions used by the Group to determine value of the assets and liabilities acquired.
fair values of assets and liabilities acquired: We consider these estimates to be significant audit risks because of we discussed these with the directors and corroborated the the impact the acquisitions have on the financial statements, and the explanations provided by comparing these assumptions to market data, inherent judgement involved in estimating the fair value of the assets our past experience of similar transactions, and the Groups business and liabilities acquired.
plan supporting the acquisition: where available, we compared the amounts recognised to supporting external documentation: we assessed the appropriateness of the accounting for significant fair value adjustments, including those in the measurement period, with reference to the acquisition accounting standard, and considered the presentation and disclosure of material adjustments in the financial statements: and we evaluated the adequacy of the disclosure of acquisitions in the Annual Report.
Carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill 2,810.0 million Our audit procedures included detailed testing of the Groups Refer to page 82 Audit and Risk Committee Report, page 113 impairment assessment over the carrying value of intangible assets, accounting policy note 2 k and pages 129 to 131 financial including goodwill, and performing the following procedures: disclosures in notes 14 and 15. we compared the total amount of discounted cash flows as per the We consider the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill Groups calculations to the Groups market capitalisation: and the risk over potential impairment to be a significant audit risk we tested the principles and integrity of the Groups discounted cash because of the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and flow model: discounting future cash flows, which are the basis of the assessment we assessed the appropriateness of any changes in the composition of recoverability.
We consider the key inputs into the impairment of cash generating units with reference to our understanding of the model to be the approved business plans and assumptions for the business: growth and discount rates.
we compared the cash flows used in the impairment model to the The Group disposed of certain businesses in the year and is in output of the Groups budgeting process and against the understanding an active process to sell certain other businesses at the year end we obtained about the business areas through our audit, and assessed if therefore treating these businesses as a disposal group held for these cash flows were reasonable: sale.
The loss on disposal and re-measurement of assets held for we assessed the historical accuracy of the forecasts used in the sale require judgement over the allocation of goodwill and intangible groups impairment model by considering actual performance against assets.
prior year budgets: we used external data and our own internal valuation specialists to evaluate the key inputs and assumptions for growth and discount rates: we performed sensitivity and break-even analyses for the key inputs and assumptions, and identified those cash generating units we consider most sensitive to impairment: we assessed the adequacy of goodwill and intangibles allocated to the businesses disposed as well as businesses classified as held for sale: we evaluated the adequacy of the Groups disclosures related to the judgments and assumptions over recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill.
Non-underlying loss before tax Our audit procedures included the following: on business disposals 164.4 million: and non-underlying loss before we inspected and challenged the nature and amounts of the tax on other items 309.0 million items included within non underlying and agreed to supporting Refer to page 82 Audit and Risk Committee Report, page 110 documentation and to third party correspondence where appropriate: accounting policy note 2 and pages 117 to 119, and 124 financial we assessed the consistency of application of the groups accounting disclosures in notes 4, 5 and 9. policy for the classification of non-underlying items year on year and The Group separately presents certain income and expenditure as that this is adequately disclosed: non-underlying on the face of the income statement.

Failure we assessed whether the underlying financial information is not to disclose clearly the nature and impact of material non-underlying otherwise misleading in the form and context in which it appears in the earnings may distort the readers view of the financial result in the Annual Report.
When improperly used and presented, these alternative reporting measures might prevent the Annual Report from being fair, balanced and understandable by hiding the real financial position and results or by making the profitability of the Group seem more attractive.

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 18.0 million 2014: 18.0 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised group profit before tax of 393.8 million 2014: 338.6 million, of which it represents 4.6% 2014: 5.3%.
In order to set this benchmark we consider the nature of items included within non-underlying earnings.
Group reported profit before tax is 112.1 million 2014: 292.4 million.
We add back certain non-underlying items including the non-trading business exit disposal charges and related impairments 136.9 million note 4 : losses on business disposals 26.3 million note 4 : impairments of property, plant and equipment 76.7 million note 5 : impairment charges against goodwill in the insurance cash generating unit 28.3 million note 5 : and the asset services settlement provisions 17.2 million note 5.
We also exclude the net gain arising on the Xchanging transaction of 3.7 million to give total adjustments of 281.7 million 2014: 46.2 million.
This results in a normalised group profit before tax 393.8 million 2014: 338.6 million.
We report to the Audit and Risk Committee any corrected and % covered by Group procedures uncorrected identified misstatements with a profit impact in excess of 0.9 million 2014: 0.9 million or a balance sheet impact in excess of Group revenue 80% 20% 13.5 million 2014: 13.5 million, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Group profit before tax 76% 24% Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by component auditors at 32 key reporting components in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland and Guernsey and by the Group audit Group total assets 96% 4% team over 2 key components in the United Kingdom.
These procedures covered approximately 80% of total Group revenue: 76% of the total Audits for Group reporting purposes profits and losses that made up group profit before tax: and 96% of total Analysis at Group level Group assets.
For the remaining components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.
The Group audit team approved the component materiality levels, which ranged from 0.3 million to 9.0 million 2014: 0.3 million to 9.0 million, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.
Detailed audit instructions were sent to the component auditors.
These instructions covered the significant audit areas that should be covered by these audits which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above and set out the information required to be reported back to the Group audit team.
Meetings were also held with auditors in all locations.
