Executive directors are required to hold 100% of their annual salary in the Companys shares.
Until this requirement is met no sales of shares that vest under long-term incentive plans are permitted other than to satisfy tax liabilities that arise on the exercise of share awards under such plans.
The Committee considers that unfettered unexercised vested nil-cost awards are economically equivalent to shares and as such that they should count on a net of tax basis toward compliance with the 100% salary guideline.
The Committee will keep the guideline level of share interest under review.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2015 63 Directors Remuneration Report continued Payments to past directors A M Whitfield On 1 July 2014, Adrian Whitfield announced his intention to step down from his role as Chief Executive Officer and director of the Company.
He agreed to give 12 months notice and to continue as Chief Executive Officer to allow sufficient time for a replacement to be found and an orderly transition to take place.
As a result of the appointment of Calum MacLean as Mr Whitfields successor on 22 January 2015, Mr Whitfield agreed with the Board to step down as Chief Executive Officer, but to remain an employee of the Company until the end of his notice period on 30June 2015.

He remained eligible for a bonus in respect of performance in 2014 as detailed on page 59.

In line with the approved policy, the awards will be reduced on a time-apportioned basis, which will be calculated to 31 March 2015 i. e. prior to ceasing employment.
Awards will be subject to the relevant performance conditions which will be measured at the normal time.
Vesting of awards will also be subject to mitigation, to the extent that MrWhitfield subsequently takes up employment with a competitor of the Company.
