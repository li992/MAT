Independent Auditors report to the members of Standard Chartered PLC only Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Standard Chartered PLC the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 235 to 325.
In our opinion: The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of the Groups loss for the year then ended The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and asapplied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act2006 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with therequirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards Regulation Summary audit approach Materiality Overall Group materiality: $150 million 2014: $300 million.
This was determined with reference toa Page 232 benchmark of the normalised average profit orloss before tax for the past three years representing 3.4 per cent.
Details for the rationale are set out onpage 233.

Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement The starting point for our audit was a consideration of the inherent risks to the Groups business model and how these have been mitigated.
This included understanding the strength of the Groups capital and liquidity position, the diversification of its asset and the flexibility and tenor of its balance sheet.
We assessed and challenged the inherent risks with reference to: International Monetary Fund IMF economic forecasts and commentary The perspectives of our in-country audit teams on their local economies, particularly the banking sector The views of our specialists in a number of areas including bank regulation, IT, tax and financial crime prevention The views of the Prudential Regulatory Authority PRA and regulators in other key geographies The results of the PRAs stress tests, published on 1 December 2015 The Groups budgets, regular forecasts, stress testing, reporting to the Audit, Board Risk and Group Risk Committees and the many discussions we have with senior management of the Group as well as country management teams Following the new strategic plan announced in November 2015, weevaluated its impact on our audit approach and the inherent risks that were identified at the planning stage earlier in the year.
We also considered the Groups control environment and, in particular, whether its systems were processing transactions completely and faithfully, and included appropriate controls designed to prevent fraud.
Our work included testing the key controls over the processing of transactions and the key inter-system, bank and custodial reconciliations as well as trade confirmations.
Finally we considered the potential impact of regulatory investigations see pages 201 to 203 on the Group, including considering the views of the Groups external and internal counsel.
These assessments enabled us to form a judgement on going concern and to determine the key areas of financial statement risk on which ouraudit should be focused.
Thereafter, by looking at both broad riskthemes across the Group and particular concerns in specific geographies and businesses, we were then able to calibrate our work to financial statement risk more precisely.
228 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Financial statements and notes In arriving at our opinion, the areas which we identified as requiring themost significant judgement in assessing subjective and uncertain estimates were: Significant risks Areas of focus 1 Impairment of loans and advances India loan exposures Corporate & Institutional Clients and Commercial Clients Page 229 China loan exposures Corporate & Institutional Clients and Commercial Clients Commodities, oil and gas and related exposures together Commodities and related exposures Increased impairment losses against Commercial exposures 2 Impact of the new strategic plan announced inNovember 2015 impairment on liquidation portfolio Valuation of financial instruments Level 3 financial instruments Page 231 Change in the estimate for credit and funding valuation adjustments Goodwill impairment Ongoing performance of underlying businesses Page 232 Impact of the new strategic plan announced inNovember 2015 Provision for redundancy and Impact of the new strategic plan announced inNovember 2015 other restructuringcosts Page 232 1.
Exposure is defined on page 157 2.
Liquidation portfolio is defined as portfolio of assets which are beyond the current risk tolerance metrics and is held for liquidation 3.
Risks and response The principal procedures we performed over these significant risks were as follows: Impairment of loans and advances Risk and areas of focus The risk is that the carrying value of loans and advances to banks andcustomers held at amortised costs may be misstated.
Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements innote 1, the Audit Committee report on pages 79 to 84 and managements commentary on the disclosures of credit risk on pages 161 to 186 Summary areas of focus Indian Corporate & Institutional Clients and Commercial Clients loanexposures due to the slow progress in policy reforms and increased refinancing pressures Chinese Corporate & Institutional Clients and Commercial Clients loan exposures due to the slowdown and rebalancing oftheeconomy and the devaluation of renminbi RMB Commodities and related exposures as commodity and oil prices continue to decline Commercial Client exposures particularly due to certain exposures to RMB in China, slowdown in India and the sensitivity ofthe exposure todecreases in commodity prices Liquidation portfolio due to the judgement required to assess a price at which the Group could sell impaired loans With regard to the Groups Retail portfolio in South Korea, which we identified as a focus area in 2014, the risk of losses has continued toreduce in 2015, partly as a result of reduced claims by customers torestructure debt accompanied by continued portfolio reduction.
Accordingly, it has not been an audit focus area in 2015.
India The Group has reduced its India exposures to $30 billion at 31 December 2015 2014: $35 billion.
The slowdown observed in 2014 has continued into 2015 and the macroeconomic backdrop continues to be challenging with slow progress in reforms which were promised by the new government in2014, continued high indebtedness in some sectors and tightening inrefinancing by local banks.
Consequently, impairments have risen significantly in 2015, mainly driven by counterparties who were already stressed in 2014 present on either early alert or in credit grades 12 to 14.
In addition, there was also a change in underlying assumptions regarding prospects of recovery on available collateral due to the challenging market conditions and recent experience from recoveries on impairedaccounts.
Additionally, there has also been an increase in impairments as a result of the new strategic plan announced in November 2015, whereby a small number of impaired exposures have now been identified to be inthe liquidation portfolio, where additional impairment was taken based on discounting revised cash flow projections based on expected salesvalue.
China China exposures amount to $50 billion 2014: $71 billion and the Group has continued to take risk-mitigating actions in this portfolio.
This has resulted in the commodities and related exposures in China reducing and exposure to banks reducing to $23.9 billion 2014: $34.5 billion.
China remained a challenging market, with growth slowing to 6.9 per cent in 2015 from 7.3 per cent in 2014, continued RMB devaluation against the US dollar, and volatility in Chinese equitymarkets.
In particular, the Group experienced increased losses within the Commercial Clients portfolio as counterparties struggled withincreased levels of debt, lower commodity prices and the RMBdevaluation.
229 Independent Auditors report to the members of Standard Chartered PLC only Commodities and related exposures The Group continued to take risk-mitigation actions during the year.
Commodities and related exposures have reduced to $54 billion 2014: $70.6 billion, comprising $20.3 billion of traders, $19.3 billion of producers including $9.6 billion of oil and gas producers, $5.9 billion ofpetroleum refineries, $7.0 billion of support activities and $1.5 billion of other corporate clients with oil and gas-related hedges.
The sustained fall in commodity prices, including oil price, has impacted a number of the Groups customers and translated into increased impairments for the year.
The majority of these impairments have arisen from customers who were already stressed in 2014.
It should be noted that a fall in commodity prices may not necessarily result in a pervasive adverse impact on the entire commodities and related exposures but may impact certain pockets that are more exposed to asustained fall in prices, for example, energy producers and some oilsupport services.
Commercial The total Commercial Clients loan portfolio of $11.2 billion 2014: $14.7 billion is a small portfolio representing 3 per cent 2014: 4 per cent of total loans and advances.
However, the impairment charge on this portfolio increased to $599 million in 2015 from $212 million in 2014 mainly due to increased impairments in India, China, Africa and Korea.
The Group has also revised its assumptions regarding recovery rates on impaired exposures downward leading to higher impairment.
This is mainly based on recent recovery experience and more stressed market conditions.
Liquidation portfolio As part of the announcement of the new strategic plan in November 2015, the Group identified $7.9 billion of loans which were outside theGroups risk tolerance levels and plan to liquidate this portfolio.
This included $7.5 billion of gross non-performing which carries a provision of$3.5 billion.
$968 million of this provision was taken for a small number of counterparties where therecovery was based on discounting revised cash flow projections based on expected sales values.
Our response Overview Corporate & Institutional Clients, Commercial Clients, Private Banking Clients and loans and advances to banks collectively Larger Clients represents 71 per cent $233 billion of the Groups net loan exposure, while Retail Clients represent 29 per cent $95 billion.
The Larger Clients exposure comprises larger loans that are monitored individually, based on the knowledge of each individual borrower.
However, the Retail clients exposure comprises much smaller value loans to a much greater number of customers.
Accordingly, loans are not monitored on an individual basis, but are grouped by product into homogeneous exposures.
Exposures are then monitored through delinquency statistics, which also drive the assessment of loan lossprovisions.
Procedures performed: Our audit procedures in all in-scope components included: For both Larger Clients and Retail Clients, our in-country teams usedtheir local knowledge to assess the trends in their local credit environments and considered the likely impact on the Groups exposures to focus their testing on key risk areas For Larger Clients, our procedures included: Testing the key controls over the credit grading and monitoring process, to assess if the risk grades allocated to counterparties were appropriate and loans were appropriately identified, on a timely basis, into early alert or credit grades 12 to 14 Performing credit assessments of all loans with a carrying value above $40 million in credit grades 12, 13 and 14 see pages 172 and 173 and loans above $75 million on the Groups Early Alert Report see page 209 together with a selection of other loans selected by country teams based on local materiality levels.
For these selected loans, weassessed the reasonableness of the forecast of recoverable cash flows, realisation of collateral and other possible sources ofrepayment.
We compared key assumptions to progress against business plans and ourown understanding of the relevant industries and business environments.
We also compared them, where possible, to externally derived evidence such as commodity prices, business performance and real estate valuations Substantive testing of a selection of credit grade one to 11 counterparties in each scoped component to test the appropriateness of the credit grade For Retail Clients, the impairment process is based on projecting losses based on the prior historical payment performance of each client, adjusted for current market conditions.
Our procedures included: Testing the accuracy of the key inputs into the models For a selection of models, using our own valuation specialists toassess the appropriateness of the impairment calculation methodology andreviewing the results of the Groups validation ofsuch models Where model adjustments were made to reflect recent loss experience and current market conditions, we assessed the appropriateness ofsuch adjustments 230 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Financial statements and notes For portfolio impairment provision PIP, our procedures included: Testing the key management controls over the input of underlying data into the models Using our modelling specialists to evaluate the methodology and the key assumptions used in determining the estimate for both theRetail Clients and the Larger Clients and wherever possible, wecompared the key assumptions used to externally available industry, financial and economic data Assessing the appropriateness of the emergence period and management adjustments to the output from models for changes in economic factors andspecific risks to the exposure Overall assessment and reasonableness of the PIP balance withrespect to the qualitative and quantitative changes in the underlying loanportfolio For the key underlying systems used for the processing of transactions we involved our information technology specialists totest a selection ofautomated controls within these systems.
We also tested the key controls over these underlying systems, for example, controls over access to systems and data and change management Assessing whether the financial statement disclosures appropriately reflect the Groups exposure to credit risk Our additional procedures in the particular risk areas of the portfolio, i. e. India, Commodities, China and Commercial exposure included: Reading managements own stress tests and risk-mitigation actions to identify areas of focus Extending our audit coverage over the stressed sectors and geographies and, in particular, to certain components within these portfolios, forexample, infrastructure and telecoms in India as well as lower-rated oil producers within Commodities and related exposures.
In doing so, we focused on the grading of the counterparties, assessed the quality of the ongoing portfolio monitoring controls, the tenor of the debt and the rate at which counterparties were moving into early alert and credit grades 12 to 14 Increasing the extent of Group audit team oversight over work done by the component team.
For example, the Senior Statutory Auditor visited Greater China and her delegate visited India For the liquidation portfolio, our additional procedures in respect ofthe impaired exposures involved assessing the key judgements, relating torecovery, namely the likely price and expected time to sell Valuation of financial instruments Risk and areas of focus The risk is that the valuation of financial instruments may be misstated due to the application of valuation techniques which often involve the exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates.
Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements innote 1, the Audit Committee report on pages 79 to 84 and the disclosures of valuation risk in note 15.
Of the financial instruments that are held at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for-sale in the Groups balance sheet, 98.5 per cent 2014: 98.5 per cent qualified as being measured using Level 1 or 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy as at 31 December 2015.
This means they were valued using prices that were observable in the market place or through models with market observable inputs, resulting in the valuation risk being low.
However, given the past experience of liquidity rapidly disappearing from emerging and developing markets, it is important to ascertain that prices are liquid enough to be genuinely observable in the market, and this has been our focus for Level 1 and 2 instruments.
The remaining 1.5 per cent $3 billion of financial instruments are classed as Level 3, because significant pricing inputs to them are unobservable.
The determination of these prices is inherently more subjective.
In 2015, the Level 3 instruments mainly comprised unlisted private equity investments and a small number ofilliquid, thinly traded loans, debt securities and derivatives.
The other notable change during the year related to valuation adjustments on derivatives, whereby the Group adopted a revised methodology forcalculating its estimate of the credit and funding valuation adjustments, to be in line with market practice.
The revised methodology for credit valuation adjustments uses market-implied spreads for estimating loss rates, rather than historical or internally modelled loss rates which were usedin the past.
Further, revised modelling capabilities were used to estimate the expected derivative exposures including the application ofnetting exposures on a counterparty legal entity jurisdiction level.
The total adjustment for theyear due to this change in estimate amounted to$863 million.
The audit risk lies in the main judgements in the calculation of this estimate, those related to the modelling assumptions used in measuring expected exposures of derivatives and the appropriateness of the proxies used for estimating loss rates for counterparties where directly observable market spreads could not be obtained.
231 Independent Auditors report to the members of Standard Chartered PLC only Our response Our audit procedures included: Testing of the Groups controls over the identification, measurement and management of valuation risk including independent price verification control, governance over valuation models, model validation and management reporting of valuation risk Testing, for a selection of pricing inputs used, that they were externally sourced and were correctly input into pricing models Using our valuation specialists to assess whether, for a selection ofmodels, the model valuation methodology is appropriate Valuing a selection of the Groups debt securities and derivative positions independently, using our valuation specialists, and comparing their valuation to the Groups valuation Testing a selection of instruments to establish how many institutions contributed to pricing inputs and how wide the ranges of observable quotes were.
This allowed us to assess the liquidity of the prices for Level 1 and 2 instruments Assessing, for a selection of investments within Level 3, key inputs, assumptions and models, considering alternative valuation methods and sensitivities to key factors For the key underlying systems used for the processing of transactions in relation to financial instruments we involved our information technology specialists to test a selection of automated controls within these systems.
We also tested the key controls over these underlying systems, for example controls over access to systems and data andchange management.
Particularly for Level 3, we assessed whether the financial statement disclosures, including sensitivity to key inputs, appropriately reflect the Groups exposure to financial instrument valuation risk We also performed a range of additional procedures on the credit and funding valuations adjustments which included: Using our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the methodology and to assess the key underlying models used Checked a selection of counterparty exposures to assess whether these were appropriately netted in arriving at the final exposures Checked that for a selection of counterparties, directly observable spreads agreed to available market data For counterparties where proxies were used because directly observable spreads were not available, we used our valuation specialists to evaluate the appropriateness of the methodology used for determining proxies and checked a selection of these to available market data, forexample, sector proxies of relevant industries Impairment of goodwill Risk and areas of focus The risk is that goodwill in the balance sheet may not be supported bythe future cash flows of the underlying business.
Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements in note 1, the Audit Committee report on pages 79 to 84 and the disclosures of goodwill in note 25.
Pre-impairment goodwill in the balance sheet is $4.1 billion but approximately $1.5 billion of this relates to businesses where post-acquisition growth in cash flows provides substantial headroom over the goodwill balance.
We regard these as low risk from a misstatement perspective.
Ourwork was therefore focused on the acquisitions wherethe headroom is lower, amounting to $2.6 billion of goodwill, or businesses which are likely to be substantially impacted by the change in strategy announced in November 2015.
Our response Our audit procedures included: We used our valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the Groups valuation approach and its derivation of discount rates.
We also compared the latter to external sources Challenging the cash flow forecasts including confirming the internal consistency of assumptions and comparing them to progress against business plans and our knowledge of the local banking environment: comparing forecasts to past performance andto GDP forecasts from the IMF: and assessing non-financial assumptions Finally we assessed whether the financial statement disclosures, including sensitivity to key inputs, are appropriate Provision for redundancy and other restructuring costs Risk and areas of focus The risk is that restructuring costs may not meet the relevant accounting standards criteria for recognition and therefore are inappropriately recorded as costs in the period.
Refer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements innote 1, the Audit Committee on pages 79 to 84 and the disclosures ofrestructuring costs in note 8.
The Group has recognised a number of impacts in the financial statements as a result of decisions linked to the new strategic plan announced inNovember 2015.
These impacts include redundancy andrelated expenses associated with enacted or committed headcount reductions Our response Our audit procedures included: Assessing the recognition of redundancy provisions required as aresult of the staff reduction measures announced, particularly tovalidate whether costs were recorded in the appropriate reportingperiod.
Assessing the recognition of onerous lease contracts and other restructuring charges Assessing the adequacy of disclosures contained within the financialstatements 232 Standard Chartered Annual Report 2015 Financial statements and notes 4.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope ofthe audit The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of ouraudit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures andto evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for thefinancial statement as a whole as follows: Overall Group materiality $150 million 2014: $300 million How we determined it With reference to a benchmark of the normalised average profit or loss before tax forthe past three years materiality represents 3.4 per cent of the benchmark.
Absolute values of profit for2014 and 2013 and loss for 2015 were considered after normalisation adjustments for the impairment of goodwill for 2015, 2014 and2013 as disclosed in note 25 and the civil penalty from the US branch for 2014 as disclosed in note 8 as these items are discrete Rationale for benchmark applied This approach mitigates undue volatility in determining our materiality and provided amore stable basis for determining materiality, focusing on the underlying profitability of the Group over the past three years We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting Group profit and loss or Group shareholders funds of more than $7.5 million and any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting Group assets and liabilities only of more than $75 million.
In addition, we reported to the Audit Committee other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
How we scoped our audit Component scoping For the purpose of planning our audit, we identified a branch or a subsidiary as components inthe Group audit.
36 components 2014: 34 components were identified in 30 countries 2014: 27 countries Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at 33 components.
A further three components were scoped as they either hold significant quantities of liquid assets or because they process significant volumes of transactions.
Specific audit procedures were performed primarily to cover these areas The Group operates eight central hubs which perform many financial processes, theoutputs of which are included in the financial information of the reporting components.
Processes within these hubs are subject to audit procedures, predominantly the testing of transaction processing and information technology controls The components scoped included all significant dealing room activities Component materiality and coverage The audit work undertaken for Group reporting purposes at these components and hubs wasperformed by the component and hub auditors to materiality levels set by, or agreed with, the Group audit team.
These materiality levels were set individually for each component or hub, having regard to the size and risk profile ofthe Group across the components and hubs, and ranged from $1 million to $40 million Reporting components represent 95 per cent 2014: 96 per cent of profit of Group loss or profit measured on an absolute basis per component before tax and 97 per cent 2014: 97 per cent of total assets Group audit team procedures and oversight As part of determining the scope and preparing the audit plan and strategy, theGroup audit ofcomponentauditors team led a global planning conference to discuss the key audit risks and obtain inputs from thecomponent teams Thereafter, Group audit instructions were sent to component auditors with respect to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back A particular focus was managing the audit work at the hubs, which require component and hub audit teams to cooperate effectively.
Common audit objectives were coordinated through common global audit programmes, which set out the responsibilities of each component team on a test-by-test basis.
This process was overseen by the Group audit team and senior partners, based in each of the Groups key regions, who oversaw their region in more detail and helped to ensure that the audit approach was fully understood and that key issues were properly addressed The Group audit team performed the work on valuation of financial instruments and goodwill impairment.
In addition, it performed quality assurance checks on loan loss judgements made by component auditors for all loans above $40 million in credit grades 12, 13 and 14 seepages 172 and 173 and key loans above $75 million on the Groups early alert list seepage 209 The Senior Statutory Auditor visited key locations to gain first-hand knowledge of key risks and issues.
This year, visits were made to Hong Kong, Singapore, India, the UAE, China, the US and South Korea 233 Independent Auditors report to the members of Standard Chartered PLC only 6.
