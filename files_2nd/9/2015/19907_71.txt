Going concern and the Directors assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within the Regulatory disclosures section of the Governance report to the financial statements and the Directors statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained within the strategic report on page 30.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: the Directors confirmation on page 93 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity: the disclosures on pages 31 34 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated: the Directors statement in section 1 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Groups ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements: the Directors explanation on page 93 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions We agreed with the Directors adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Councils Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
The description of risks below should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on page 62.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
RISK: INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY VALUATION 1,174.2 MILLION The Groups principal assets are investment properties and investment properties under development that are either owned on balance sheet or through the investments that the Group holds in LSAV and USAF.
The investment properties are carried at fair value based on an appraisal by the Groups independent external valuers who carry out the valuations at six-monthly intervals for the Group in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation Professional Standards the Red Book, taking into account transactional evidence during the year.
94 94 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 01 Strategic report 02 Corporate governance 03 Financial statements 04 Other information The valuation of these properties is underpinned by a number of judgements and assumptions, such as property yields, rental growth, occupancy and property management costs.
A small change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation of properties and, with respect to the valuation of the USAF properties, could also have a significant impact on a key input to the calculation of the performance fee recognised for the year ended 31 December 2015 as this is based on the net asset value of the fund.
With regards to the investment properties under development, additional judgement is required to forecast discounted cash flows with a deduction for construction costs to complete.
Refer to Section 3.1: Wholly owned property assets How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Management conduct a detailed exercise in the assessment of the valuation of the Groups property portfolio.
We performed testing on the property valuations and critically assessed the judgements and estimates that had been made.
This work included: Understanding and documenting the underlying business process and then evaluating the design, determining implementation and testing the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls: Understanding and challenging the assumptions taken in relation to key drivers such as rental income and growth, occupancy, yields and costs with reference to the trends at the end of the year and the following years budget and the Groups strategic plan: Meeting with the Groups valuers to understand the assumptions being taken and the consistency of the judgements within the prior year: Working with our valuation specialists within our Deloitte Real Estate team to validate the assumptions used against market data: Assessing the Groups development appraisal process through meeting with the development team and assessing the forecast cost to complete against budget and substantive testing of costs incurred to date: and Use of data analytic tools to determine whether there were any anomalies in the valuation spreadsheet data sent to the valuers RISK: ACCOUNTING FOR JOINT VENTURES 610.6 MILLION A significant proportion of the Groups assets are held within USAF and LSAV which are jointly owned entities that are accounted for as joint ventures.
At 31 December 2015, Unite had a 21% ownership in USAF and 50% ownership in LSAV, and acts as manager of both joint venture vehicles.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements, and the Groups role as manager of the joint venture vehicles, the assessment of control involves judgements around a number of significant factors, particularly with regards to USAF given that it is a multi-investor fund and the Unite ownership stake is subject to change.
In accordance with IFRS 10, there is a need to assess control with regards to the ability to direct relevant activities, have exposure to variable returns and the ability to use power to affect returns at each reporting period.
Refer to Section 3.4: Investments in joint ventures How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Our audit procedures on this area focused on assessing the activities of the businesses, understanding the contractual agreements in place and identifying the methodology applied by management in reaching their business decisions in order to consider the appropriateness of the classification of these arrangements as joint ventures in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 10.
With regards to both USAF and LSAV, we have: critically assessed the key activities and how they impact the returns to the Group from the funds and challenged managements own consideration of these factors in their application of IFRS 10: and assessed the Groups monitoring of its role and the three key factors relating to control and its exercise in accordance with the judgement required under IFRS 10.
Given the particular focus on USAF, we have: assessed the role of the USAF Advisory Committee which represents the interests of all unit holders on an on-going basis, including obtaining evidence as to how it has carried out its duties and evaluated where decisions were taken that did not involve the Committee as to indications of the ability of the Group to exercise control: and critically evaluated the impact of the percentage ownership on a regular basis 95 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITE GROUP PLC ONLY CONTINUED OF THE UNITE GROUP PLC ONLY CONTINUED RISK: RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS 1.7 MILLION The Group has material tax losses brought forward from prior years.
Recognition of deferred tax assets relating to these losses is only made when it is probable that these losses will be utilised in the future and is therefore dependent on recognised deferred tax liabilities and the forecast taxable profits which involve significant judgements and assumptions regarding future performance.
The complex structure of the Group also requires consideration as to the ability of the Group to utilise the losses in individual legal entities.
At 31 December 2015, the Group has recognised all corporation tax losses as deferred tax assets.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 1.7 million at 31 December 2015 2014: 8.9 million.
Refer to Section 2.5: Tax How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Our audit procedures included: Testing the consistency of forecasts and projections used to determine the level of deferred tax with other judgements such as valuations and going concern: Understanding and challenging the recognition of the losses against deferred tax liabilities arising in the year and each entitys ability to utilise the losses: and Working closely with our tax audit specialists to determine whether the key judgements are understood and a consistent approach is applied across the Group OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be 9.3 million, which is 0.7% of net assets.
In addition to net assets, we consider the EPRA earnings measure to be a critical financial performance measure for the Group and we have applied a lower threshold of 3.1 million based on 5% of EPRA earnings for testing of revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses, loan interest and similar charges, finance income, share of joint venture profit and taxation.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 186,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
The Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior Statutory Auditor.
The audit is performed centrally, as the books and records for each entity within the Group are maintained at head office.
We also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information.
We audit all of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures which are subject to audit at statutory materiality level, which in many cases is substantially lower than Group materiality.
