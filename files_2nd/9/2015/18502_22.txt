Fidessa group plc 43 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Independent auditors report to the members of Fidessa group plc only Opinion and conclusions arising from our audit 1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Fidessa group plc for the year ended 31st December 2015 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the group and parent company balance sheets, the group and parent company cash flow statements, the group and parent company statements of changes in equity and related notes.
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 31st December 2015 and of the groups profit for the year then ended: the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU : the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatements that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: Revenue recognition 295.5 million Refer to Audit Committees report, accounting policy note 2d and notes to the consolidated financial statements note 5.
The risk The group provides its products and services to customers in bundled packages.
These packages may contain two or more of the following elements: software rental, consultancy services including those required to deploy the groups software, market data charges and connectivity services.
The allocation of revenue between the different elements of a bundled package can require significant judgement.
Consultancy services, particularly deployment activities, may be provided on a fixed price basis and such services are recognised based on the percentage of completion POC.
Determining the POC of the contract, which may include making estimates of cost contingencies, requires significant judgement.
Where the products or services are being deployed at multiple customer sites, judgement is required to determine whether the group has fulfilled its obligations associated with each element of revenue across the sites.
The allocation of total revenue to the individual elements of the contract and the need to assess the timing of recognition for each element presents a risk of accelerated or delayed recognition of revenue.
Our response Our audit procedures included: We critically assessed the allocation of revenue to the individual elements of the contract by selecting a sample of significant contracts and comparing the relative fair values of each element of the contract.
For fixed price consultancy services which were not completed at the balance sheet date, we assessed the calculation of the stage of completion.
Costs incurred to date primarily include labour costs and our procedures included assessing whether those costs are appropriately allocated to the contracts.
We also challenged the assessment of forecast costs to complete.
Where contingencies were included in the calculation of costs to complete, we inspected and critically assessed the rationale for the basis for their calculation with the directors and project managers who are responsible for delivering the projects.
We also evaluated the historical accuracy of the utilisation of contingencies.
Fidessa group plc 44 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Independent auditors report to the members of Fidessa group plc only continued For contracts where software, connectivity and market data revenue has been recognised during the year, our work focused on assessing whether the internal control process regarding approval of contractual terms had been followed.
Our work also focused on assessing whether the group had obtained sufficient evidence that it has fulfilled the relevant obligations under the deployment phase of the contract.
This included, for a sample of significant contracts, assessing whether the group had obtained appropriate evidence that the relevant deployment services had been completed and that it was therefore appropriate to recognise revenue.
We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of amounts recognised as revenue during the period or deferred at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill 44.9 million Refer to Audit Committees report, accounting policy note 2j and notes to the consolidated financial statements note 13.
The risk There is a risk of irrecoverability of goodwill, because of the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which form the basis for the assessment of the goodwill recoverability.
Historical valuations identified that there was significant sensitivity to changes in forecast operating margin and the ability of the buy-side business to achieve its medium-term revenue growth rates.
Our response Our audit procedures included testing of the budgeting procedures upon which the forecasts used in the discounted cash flow model are based and assessing the integrity of the model.
We considered the historical accuracy of key assumptions used in the model by comparing the previous estimates of revenue and cost growth to the actual amounts achieved.
We challenged the growth assumptions applied to revenue over the next five years of the cash flow model.
We also challenged the assumptions and methodology used to determine the discount rate used in the model.
We performed our own break-even analysis on the assumptions and considered the likelihood of the assumptions reaching these break-even points.
Our assessment included consideration of the potential risk of bias and consideration of the historical accuracy of the directors forecasts.
We considered whether the disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Capitalised development costs 45.2 million Refer to Audit Committees report, accounting policy note 2j and notes to the consolidated financial statements note 13.
The risk The group capitalises certain costs, primarily the employment costs of its software developers, which are incurred on the development of its software products.
In order to determine the amount of cost that should be capitalised, including the proportion of cost associated with its software developers on both new products and enhancements to the groups existing products, the group must assess whether the cost meets the capitalisation criteria set out in the accounting standards.
The group must also apply judgement in determining whether the future net cash flows expected to be derived from the sale of its developed products support the recoverability of the capitalised amounts.
Our response Our audit procedures included evaluating the design and effectiveness of controls in place to separately identify the time on development activities which is categorised as meeting the capitalisation criteria set out by the accounting standards.
On a sample basis, we agreed capitalised amounts to supporting documentation including timesheet data.
We considered whether any recently launched products or those previously under development had been discontinued or their deployment delayed and, where this had occurred, we evaluated whether any impairment of the capitalised costs was required.
We also considered the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of capitalised development costs.
Income tax expense 9.6 million Refer to Audit Committees report, accounting policy note 2h and notes to the consolidated financial statements note 9.
Fidessa group plc 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2015 The risk Tax provisions require the group to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures.
This is one of the key judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on due to the group carrying out contracts across a number of tax jurisdictions, the complexities of transfer pricing and other international tax legislation and the time taken for tax matters to be agreed with tax authorities.
Our response Our audit procedures included the use of our own international and local tax specialists to assess the tax positions.
Our specialists also considered correspondence with the relevant tax authorities to analyse and challenge the assumptions used to determine tax provisions based on our knowledge and experience of the application of the international and local legislation by the relevant authorities and courts.
We also considered the adequacy of the tax disclosures including any uncertainties relating to recognised tax liabilities and assets.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at 1.7 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit before income tax of 39.1 million, of which it represents 4.3%.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected misstatements exceeding 0.1 million, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the groups four reporting components, we subjected three to audits for group reporting purposes.
These were carried out in the UK, North America and Hong Kong components.
The UK audit team performed the work in the UK and North America and the work in Hong Kong was completed by a component auditor.
These procedures covered 93% of total revenue: 96% of profit before taxation: and 93% of total assets.
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the key reporting components were all performed to local materiality levels set by, or agreed with, the group audit team.
These local materiality levels were set individually for each component and ranged from 0.4 million to 1.0 million.
The group audit team instructed the component auditor in Hong Kong as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back to the group audit team.
Telephone meetings were held with the auditor in Hong Kong.
On these calls the findings reported to the group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group audit team was then performed by the component auditor.
