66 Governance Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Bellway p. l. c. Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Bellway p. l. c. for the year ended 31 July 2015, set out on pages 69 to 99.
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 31 July 2015 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended: the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU : the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit was as follows: Profit recognition on current sites and the carrying amount of land held for development and work in progress gross profit 434.8 million: land held for development and work in progress 2,108.9 million Refer to pages 40 to 43 Audit Committee Report, pages 75 and 78 Accounting Policies and note 13 on page 85 financial disclosures.
The risk Profit recognition on current sites and the net realisable value of land held for development and work in progress are both reliant on the Groups forecast of future selling prices and construction costs, both of which are uncertain.
Forecast selling prices are inherently uncertain due to challenges in assessing market conditions.
Construction costs and in particular, sub-contractor costs, can vary with market conditions and may also be incorrectly forecast due to unforeseen events during construction.
Gross profit is recognised on house sales based on the latest whole site gross margin, which is an output of the site valuations prepared by the Groups divisional technical teams.
These valuations use actual and forecast selling prices and construction costs and are sensitive to inaccuracies in recording actual costs incurred, forecast costs to complete and expected selling prices.
Land held for development and work in progress are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value i. e. the forecast selling price less the remaining costs to construct and sell.
An assessment of the net realisable value of land held for development and work in progress is carried out at each balance sheet date and is dependent on the Groups estimates of future selling prices and construction costs, together with the likelihood of receiving planning permission for land held for development.
Planning permission is dependent on local and national policies, and without planning permission sites cannot be developed.
A change in the Groups estimate of sales price and build cost could have a material effect on the carrying value of land held for development and work in progress and the level of profit recognition in the Groups financial statements.
Our response Our audit procedures included: Inspecting a sample of land additions to evaluate the terms of the transaction and checking to the amounts recorded in the financial statements, including re-performing the calculation of fair value for a sample of land acquired on deferred payment terms: Testing the Groups controls over the authorisation and recording of costs, including agreeing a sample of costs incurred to date from job cost reports to invoice and or payment, including checking that they relate to the site against which they have been allocated: Testing the performance of the Groups controls over the production of site valuations, including the reconciliation of actual costs to date to job costs reports: We attended a selection of site valuation meetings, where incurred costs and revenues were reviewed against budgets and estimates of future cost and selling prices were discussed, challenged and updated, to check that senior operational, commercial and financial management were effectively challenging the forecast margins utilised to recognise profit: Bellway p. l. c.

The site reviews included the following procedures, among others, where relevant: i making inquiries of senior operational, commercial and financial management, about their assessment of risks for these sites: ii reviewing site plans to gain an understanding of progress made and problems arising on the site: iii comparing actual and budgeted unit sales and average selling prices to date to identify potential construction or sale issues: and iv for a sample of costs, agreeing total estimated costs to purchase orders sub-contractor agreements including variations : For all active sites and sites completed in the year we performed a comparison of budgeted and latest forecast margin, atJuly2015, in order to assess the Groups ability to forecast accurately: On a site-by-site basis, we compared the gross margin recognised in the financial statements, with the latest site valuations to determine whether the margin recognised was appropriate: We developed an expectation, based on our attendance at site valuation meetings, our detailed site reviews, and other procedures, including inquiries and reviews of divisional board reports, of sites to be included in the Groups net realisable value provision.
We obtained the Groups net realisable value provision and compared land held for development and work in progress sites included to our expectations and with reference to site valuations, determined whether amounts included had been calculated appropriately for these sites: For a sample of developments completed in the year, we determined whether the cost to complete accrual created was supported by the latest site valuation: Assessing the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in relation to areas of judgement and estimation in relation to these balances.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements, as a whole was set at 21 million determined with reference to a benchmark of profit before tax, of which it represents 5.9%.
In the prior year materiality was set at 15 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of revenue, of which it represented 1.0%.
The benchmark has changed from revenue to profit before tax as we believe this is a more relevant measure for users of the financial statements.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 0.6 million, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group audit team performed the audits of the Groups principal components which covered 100% of total Group revenue, 99% of total Group profit before taxation, and 99% of total Group assets.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes on the Groups principle components were performed to materiality levels that ranged from 8.6 million to 12.0 million, as set by the Group audit team.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified In our opinion: the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements: and information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 38 to 40 and in the Audit Committee Report, set out on pages 40 to 43, with respect to internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, is consistent with the financial statements.
