Independent auditors report to the shareholders of Mondi Limited Opinion We have audited the combined and consolidated financial statements of Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries Group set out on pages 146 to 195, which comprise the combined and consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015, and the combined and consolidated income statement, the combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the combined and consolidated statement of changes in equity and the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the combined and consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the combined and consolidated financial position of Mondi Limited as at 31 December 2015, and its combined and consolidated financial performance and its combined and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008.
Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ISAs.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors Code of Professional Conduct for Registered Auditors IRBA Code, which is consistent with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants Part A and B, together with other ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the combined and consolidated financial statements in South Africa, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the combined and consolidated financial statements of the current period.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the combined and consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Assuch this has been noted as a key audit matter.
Key assumptions challenged include those related to the level at which impairment is assessed, being for property, plant and equipment the lowest level at which largely independent cash inflows can be identified and for goodwill the businesses that are expected to benefit from the acquisition, forecast future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rates applied.
We also evaluated the directors assessment of the sensitivity of the Groups impairment models to reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions and considered the disclosures provided by the Group in relation to its impairment reviews.
We concluded that the levels at which impairments were assessed and the assumptions used were appropriate.
In the context of the inherent uncertainties disclosed, the valuations, determined with reference to the forecast future cash flows, future growth rates and discount rates applied, are considered to be within a reasonable range of the possible outcomes.
The disclosure in relation to the impairment reviews and the assumptions applied is considered comprehensive.

The other information does not include the combined and consolidated financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
Our opinion on the combined and consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance or conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the combined and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the combined and consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of combined and consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the combined and consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 139 Independent auditors report to the shareholders of Mondi Limited Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these combined and consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the combined and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the combined and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the combined and consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the combined and consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the combined and consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the combined and consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The financial statements comprise the combined and consolidated income statement, the combined and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the combined and consolidated and Mondi plc parent company statements of financial position, the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows, the combined and consolidated and Mondi plc parent company statements of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 34 of the combined and consolidated financial statements and notes 1 to 9 of the Mondi plc parent company financial statements.

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern and the directors assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting and the directors statement on the longer-term viability of the Group, both contained within the Strategic report on page 43.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: the directors confirmation on page 43 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity: the disclosures on pages 40 to 42 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated: the directors statement in note 1 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Groups ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements: or the directors explanation on page 43 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Councils Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

In performing our audit procedures, we used internal in particular in relation to the forecast future cash flows, future growth valuation specialists to assess the discount rates applied by benchmarking rates and the discount rates applied.
Key assumptions challenged include those related to the level at which impairment is assessed, being for property, plant and equipment the lowest level at which largely independent cash inflows can be identified and for goodwill the businesses that are expected to benefit from the acquisitions, forecast future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rates applied.
We also evaluated managements assessment of the sensitivity of the Groups impairment models to reasonably possible changes and considered the disclosures provided by the Group in relation to its impairment reviews.

Our prior year audit report included a further risk relating to business combinations which is not included in our report in the current year.
Due to the smaller scale of the business combinations completed in the current year, they have not been assessed as having the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team and as such have been excluded from the risks identified above.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the dual listed company DLC audit committee as discussed on pages 96 and 97.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements 2015 143 Independent auditors report to the members of Mondi plc Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 36 million 2014: 30 million, which is below 5% 2014: 5% of profit before tax and special items, and below 2% 2014: 2% of equity.
Special items are defined by the Group as those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance by the Group with further details provided in note 3 to the financial statements.
Since these items are non-recurring in nature, and we consider profit before tax and special items to be a key driver of the business and a focus for shareholders, we have concluded that it is appropriate to exclude these items in determining materiality.
We agreed with the DLC audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences identified in excess of 720,000 2014: 600,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also reported to the DLC audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit Mondi Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi plc and Mondi Limited, which operate under a DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, and Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, the financial statements of Mondi Group is prepared and reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused primarily on the audit work at 16locations 2014: 16 locations from across Mondi Group, which were subject to a full audit completed using materiality which was set at a level lower than Group materiality.
These 16 locations 2014: 16 locations represent the principal business units and account for 64% 2014: 63% of the Groups revenue.
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
A further 27 locations 2014: 27 locations were subject to an audit of specified account balances where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Groups operations at those locations.
These 27 locations 2014: 27 locations represent a further 19% 2014: 20% of the Groups revenue.
From the above audit scope, in aggregate the locations subject to audit procedures represents 83% 2014:83% of the Groups revenue.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits the 10 operating locations 2014: 10 operating locations that have been assessed as the most financially significant to the Group at least once every three years, or more frequently where other indicators are identified.
In the current year, a senior member of the Group audit team therefore visited certain of the Groups operations in Slovakia, Sweden, South Africa and the United States.
For all full scope locations, we discussed risk assessment and audit planning with the component team before the commencement of our work.
Furthermore, for each of the businesses included within the programme of planned visits, the Group audit team also discussed audit findings with the relevant component audit team throughout the audit engagement and reviewed relevant audit working papers.
For the remaining six locations 2014: six locations where full audits were completed, we discussed audit findings with the relevant component audit team, reviewed audit working papers in relation to key issues and discussed key matters with divisional management where considered necessary in forming our Group audit opinion.
In relation to the 27 locations 2014: 27 locations which were subject to an audit of specified account balances, we discussed the results of these businesses and accounting matters arising through our involvement in divisional meetings with management.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the UK Companies Act 2006 In our opinion: the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
