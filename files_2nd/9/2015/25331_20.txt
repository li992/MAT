Overview of our audit approach Risks of material - Misstatement or manipulation of investment fair value misstatement - Revenue recognition Audit scope - We performed an audit of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 - The Company has determined that it is an investment entity under the requirements of IFRS10 amendments for Investment Entities IFRS 10 amendments and therefore only consolidates service entities as explained in note 2.
Service entities are audited to Group materiality threshold.
- Procedures were performed by the Group audit team.
Materiality - Overall Group materiality of 12.9m which represents 1% of Equity.
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team.
In addressing these risks, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Misstatement or manipulation of investment fair value Investments comprise a portfolio of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair values of these investments are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at a rate appropriate to the risk profile of each investment.
In determining the discount rate, the relevant long-term government bond yields, specific investment risks and the evidence of recent transactions are considered.
Details of the valuation process and key sensitivities are provided in note 12 of the financial statements and are discussed in the report of the Audit Committee on page 53 55.
The valuation risk includes the risk of an inappropriate valuation model being applied including the risk of manipulation or error in both the assumptions applied and the amount and timing of expected cash flows.
We have tested the effectiveness of controls in operation over the investment acquisitions, Our response to forecasting cash flows, distributions and model integrity and we have placed reliance on control over the risk these processes.
We selected a sample of investments to provide coverage over the key geographies the Group operates in and to address significant demand risk and performed the following procedures : Valuation assumption: We engaged our EY valuation specialists to assess the discount rates subdebt and equity and senior debt, inflation rates and deposit rate assumptions used in the models by comparing these to market data.
International Public Partnerships Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 58 Independent Auditors Report To The Members Of International Public Partnerships Limited Our response to Model integrity: We engaged our EY financial modelling specialists to sample test the logical the risk operation of the financial models.
continued Model inputs: We agreed a sample of contractual cash flows to contractual terms and actual cash flows.
We engaged EY valuation specialists to assess demand based cash flows which require significant judgement.
For all other investments we performed the following procedures: We tested historical accuracy of forecasting by comparing the historical forecast distributions from the projects to the actual distributions.
We developed our own expectations for changes in investment values.
For each investment outside our expected range we obtained and corroborated reasons for the difference.
Consistency of assumptions: We tested that material macro-economic assumptions discount rates, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates, deposit rates and tax rates were applied consistently to each investment.
What we We confirmed that there were no matters arising from our work that we wanted to bring to the audit concluded to the committees attention.
Audit Committee Risk Revenue Recognition For the purposes of our risk assessment, dividend and interest income is treated as revenue and as it is material we have treated revenue recognition as a significant risk.
Given the nature of the work we previously performed and the sources of revenue the impact of increasing our risk assessment on our audit strategy was limited.
Management may seek to inflate revenue in order to improve the Groups reported performance.
Our response to We updated our understanding of the Groups processes and policies for revenue recognition the risk including our understanding of the systems and controls implemented: and We agreed a sample of dividend and interest receipts to documentation from investees and we checked the calculation of interest amounts and the allocation thereof to the appropriate period.
What we We confirmed that there were no matters identified during our audit work on revenue recognition that concluded to the we wanted to bring to the attention of the audit committee.
Audit Committee The scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope.
Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality Materiality is the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 12.9 million 2014: 10.6 million, which is 1% 2014: 1% of equity.
We believe that total equity provides us with an appropriate basis for audit materiality as net asset value is a key published performance measure and is a key metric used by management in assessing and reporting on the overall performance of the Group.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and noted that total equity had increased from approx.
1.1bn at 30 June 2015 to 1.3bn as at 31 December 2015 mainly due to capital raise in Nov 2015.
This resulted in a higher materiality of 12.9m compared to 10.8m that was originally determined at the audit planning stage.
International Public Partnerships Annual Report and Financial Statements 2015 59 Independent Auditors Report To The Members Of International Public Partnerships Limited A lower materiality of 2.9 million 2014: 1.9 million has been applied to Interest income, Dividend income and Management costs to be responsive to the expectations of the users of the financial statements with regard to misstatements in these balances of a lesser amount than the Group materiality.
Performance materiality Performance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that overall performance materiality i. e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance for the Group should be 50% of materiality, namely 6.4m 2014: 50% of materiality, namely 5.3m.
The performance materiality percentage is consistent with last year.
Our objective in adopting this approach was to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences in the financial statements did not exceed our materiality level.
Reporting threshold Reporting threshold is an amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 0.6 million 2014: 0.5 million, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the parent companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor As explained more fully in the Directors Responsibilities Statement set out on page 57, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Groups members, as a body, in accordance with Section 262 of the Companies Law.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Groups members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Group and the Groups members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
