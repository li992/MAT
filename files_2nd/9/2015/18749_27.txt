As permitted by FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures the Company has not disclosed transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
Investments Investments comprise the Companys investment in subsidiaries and are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Dividends Final dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders whereas interim dividends payable are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised as an asset when they are approved.
Financial Instruments Non-derivative financial assets are classified as cash and debtors.
Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Treasury Shares When the Company purchases its own equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity until the shares are reissued or disposed of.
When such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, increases shareholders funds.
When such shares are cancelled they are transferred to the capital redemption reserve.

At 30 September 2015, the contingent liability totalled 14,123 million 2014: 9,965 million.
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2015 and which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file separate financial statements with the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liabilities for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2015.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar, have therefore availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies Amendment Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the above guarantees and do not consider them to be material.
They have therefore not been recognised on the balance sheet.
x Related Party Disclosures Details of Directors emoluments and interests are provided within the Directors Remuneration Report.
These disclosures form part of the financial statement.
