Independent auditors report on the summary financial statements to the shareholders of Mondi Limited The accompanying summary financial statements of Mondi Limited, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015 and selected notes, are derived from the audited annual financial statements of Mondi Limited for the year ended 31 December 2015.
We expressed an unmodified audit opinion on those annual financial statements in our report dated 24February2016.
The summary financial statements do not contain all the disclosures required by the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008 as applicable to annual financial statements.
Reading the summary financial statements, therefore, is not a substitute for reading the audited annual financial statements of Mondi Limited.
Directors responsibility for the summary financial statements The directors are responsible for the preparation of the summary financial statements in accordance with framework concepts and the measurement and recognition requirements of IFRS and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the summary financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
