In our opinion: the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended: the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU : the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Financial Statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: REVENUE RECOGNITION 729.2 million Refer to page 48 Audit Committee report, pages 90 and 91 accounting policy and pages 96 and 97 financial disclosures THE RISK THE RESPONSE Revenue recognised in relation to the supply of gas and In this area our audit procedures included: electricity includes estimates of the value of the energy we assessed the appropriateness of the revenue supplied to customers between the date of the last meter recognition through comparison with relevant accounting reading and the year end.
standards and industry practice: The method of estimating such revenues is complex and we analysed the accuracy of the estimates made by the judgemental, requiring estimates and assumptions to be billing system for a sample of customers by comparing made to assess the volume of energy supplied, which is actual usage, obtained from meter readings, with the billing system generated estimated usage for the same sensitive to a number of factors, one of which includes period: any volatility in weather patterns.
for a sample of customers, we agreed the meter The risk of misstatement is that the accounting for the readings, including those taken after the year end, used Groups estimated revenues does not appropriately reflect as the key inputs in assessing the estimation accuracy the underlying actual delivery of gas and electricity and back to source documentation: as a result revenues may be misstated.
we tested the Groups controls over revenue recognition including reconciliations between the billing system, cash receipts and the general ledger: and we also considered whether the critical accounting estimates, judgements and assumptions, and accounting policy disclosures properly reflect the judgements and estimates inherent in recognising revenue.

implementation of the Groups discounted cash flow model: The recoverability of the intangible asset is subject to judgement in terms of the assumptions used in the comparing actual performance for the year against Groups discounted cash flow forecasts.
Energy prices forecasts in the model for the same period: are volatile, and there are high levels of competition in evaluating the Groups assumptions included within the the energy supply market, leading to changing market discounted cash flow forecasts by comparing key inputs conditions.
These factors increase the risk of error in the such as projected growth, cost inflation and discount Groups assumptions and therefore increase the risk of rates to internally and externally derived data: impairment.
performing sensitivity analysis on the assumptions: and Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting assessing the adequacy of the Groups disclosures and discounting future cash flows, which are the basis about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the key assessment to changes in key assumptions.
judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on.
