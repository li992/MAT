74 Report and Accounts December 2015 RIT Capital Partners plc | Company Highlights | Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Other Information | Independent Auditors Report to the Members of RIT Capital Partners plc Overview Overall Group materiality: 42.7 million which represents 1.75% of net assets.
The Group comprises an investment company and its subsidiaries, managing a widely Materiality diversified portfolio.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 18 companies including J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited the Manager and the Parent Company.
We audited the financial statements of 10 subsidiaries and the Parent Company which Audit scope together account for100% of the Groups income and 100% of its profit before tax, and 99% of its net assets.
We tailored the scope of our audit taking into account the types of investments within the Areas of focus Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
Our areas of focus comprise: Valuation of direct private investments, investments in funds, investment property and derivatives.
Risk of fraud in income recognition onfor gains losses on fair value investments.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as areas of focus in the table below.
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Valuation of direct private investments, investments in We understood and evaluated the valuation methodology funds, investment property and derivatives applied, by reference to industry practice, and tested the techniques used by management in determining the fair Refer to page 29 Audit and Risk Committee Report, value of the investment portfolio.

For direct private investments, we were able to: The investment portfolio at 31 December 2015 included compare valuations to recently completed quoted equity, short term government bonds, direct transactions: private investments, investments in funds, investment property and derivatives.

markets, and are therefore more subjective.
This, together with our knowledge of the investee entities and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation guidelines, enabled us to discuss with and challenge management and directors as to the appropriateness of the methodology and key inputs used, and the valuations themselves.
We found that managements valuations of direct private investments were supported by the available evidence, and in particular that the assumptions used were appropriate based on the investees circumstances, and actual and expected financial performance.
For investments in funds, we were able to: confirm the fund valuation with underlying fund managers or administrators: check the funds most recently audited financial statements or latest fund manager reports to corroborate the valuations applied by management: and assess prior year valuations which were based on unaudited net asset statements by reference to their respective audited financial statements.
For investment property, we were able to: confirm that the valuation report was compliant with best practice as set out in the RICS Valuation Professional Standards January 2014 the Red Book : obtain satisfactory explanations for the assumptions made by management in the valuation: and test the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models and verify the inputs into the models by agreeing them to third party sources where applicable.

The complexity and extent of Directors: these arrangements means that there is a risk that not all evaluating managements listing of related parties and related party transactions are identified and disclosed in related parties transactions for completeness based the financial statements.
on our knowledge gained from the audit: reading minutes of the Conflicts Committee, a group of independent non-executive Directors who monitor all arrangements with related parties: agreeing related party transactions to supporting documentation: obtaining written confirmation from the Parent Company of the list of all related parties: and performing scanning analytics for possible additional related party transactions.
We found no unidentified related parties or inconsistencies between the reported related party transactions and our testing in this area or the rest of our audit.
How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
We audited the Parent Company and 10 significant subsidiaries of the Group, which together account for 99% of the Groups income, 99% of its profit before tax, and 99% of its net assets.
This, together with procedures performed over the consolidation, has provided the evidence we need for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
78 Report and Accounts December 2015 RIT Capital Partners plc | Company Highlights | Strategic Report | Governance | Financial Statements | Other Information | Independent Auditors Report to the Members of RIT Capital Partners plc Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall Group materiality 42.7 million 2014: 40.2 million.
How we determined it 1.75% of net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that net assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group, and this is also a generally accepted auditing benchmark used for companies in this industry.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 2.1 million 2014: 2.0 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors statement, set out on page 18, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the Directors statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the Directors statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Groups and Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting Consistency of other information Companies Act 2006 opinion In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2015 79 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of RIT Capital Partners plc ISAs UK & Ireland reporting Under ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: information in the Report & Accounts is: We have no exceptions to report.

Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors process supporting their statements: checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code: and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2015 81 Independent Auditors Report to the Members of RIT Capital Partners plc In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Report & Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
