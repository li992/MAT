SSP Group Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Financial statements 57 Independent auditors report to the members of SSP Group plc only Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of SSP Group plc for the year ended 30 September 2015 set out on pages 60 to 102.
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 30 September 2015 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended: the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union: the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006: and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: a Valuation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 609.7m Refer to Audit Committee report on page 35, notes 1 and 2 on pages 67 and 70 and note 11 on pages 77 and 78.
The risk The Group carries significant goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of businesses in a wide range of geographical locations.
The Groups business is impacted by economic trends such as levels of discretionary travel and consumer spending.
There is a risk that the Groups goodwill balance may not be recoverable due to economic and political uncertainty and poor trading conditions.
The Groups assessment of impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is based on discounted future cash flow analysis.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in preparing cash flow projections, including the subjectivity in determining the underlying assumptions, this is one of the most judgemental areas of the audit.
Our response In this area our audit procedures were as follows: We challenged the assumptions for key inputs used by the Group in their forecasts, such as projected market growth, future capital expenditure levels, revenue growth rates, cost projections and inflation, by comparing them to external data, industry norms and our expectations based on our knowledge and experience of the Group.
Additionally, our valuation specialists assisted us in assessing the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions used by the Group.
We applied sensitivities to key assumptions to assess their impact on the recoverability of the assets.
We evaluated the historical accuracy of the Groups forecasts by comparing actual to budgeted results.
We corroborated our understanding of any adverse changes in the business, such as anticipated decline in trading, with the Groups forecasts and considered whether or not such events had been appropriately captured in the impairment models.
We compared the results of the discounted cash flows against the Groups market capitalisation, after adjusting for its debt, to determine if there were any significant differences requiring further investigation.
We also considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosure of the key risks and whether that disclosure reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets.
b Completeness, existence and accuracy of current and deferred tax net current tax liability: 13.9m, net deferred tax asset: 1.9m Refer to the Audit Committee report on page 35, notes 1 and 2 on pages 69 and 70, note 8 on page 75 and note 13 on pages 79 and 80.
The risk The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions.
The interpretation of tax law can be complex and judgemental.
Differences in tax laws may have a significant impact on how the Group calculates its current and deferred tax liabilities.
Additionally, the outcomes of tax audits and related tax provisions may be different to those anticipated by the Group.
The amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax assets involves judgement, as it is based on specific considerations, such as the future profitability of the business in various jurisdictions, local tax law and availability of temporary differences, such as an excess of capital allowances over depreciation or tax losses.
During the current year, the Group has, following a period of realising tax losses, begun to demonstrate tax profits in some jurisdictions indicating that deferred tax assets can be recovered.
Therefore this is one of the key judgement areas on which our audit is focused.
58 Financial statements Independent auditors report to the members of SSP Group plc only continued Our response In this area, our audit procedures were as follows: We used our own tax specialists to assist us in assessing and challenging the assumptions and judgement made by the Group.
We considered all significant differences between the statutory and effective rates in each jurisdiction and assessed whether adjustments to accounting profit are in accordance with accounting standards and local laws.
We considered the tax provisions made by the Group and the underlying assumptions.
In assessing the Groups calculations, we have used both our own knowledge of recent tax cases and, where available, external data on the pattern of recent local tax settlements.
We have inspected correspondence with relevant tax authorities and any relevant transfer pricing documentation to determine whether the tax provisions made by the Group were reasonable.
In assessing the level of deferred tax asset balances recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, we compared the assumptions used in respect of future taxable income to the Groups long-term forecasts and budget for the relevant jurisdictions.
We considered whether the improving performance in certain jurisdictions, where there were unrecognised deferred tax assets, amounted to convincing evidence sufficient to support the recognition of deferred tax assets.
In addition to profitability, we also considered other factors, such as the expected timing of reversal of temporary differences, any restrictions in accessing such temporary differences, and other qualitative factors specific to each of the jurisdictions in question.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in respect of current and deferred taxes.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 10.0m, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group revenue of 1,832.9m of which it represents 0.5%.
We consider revenue to be the most appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year on year than Group profit before tax.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 0.5m in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Groups 11 reporting components, nine were subject to an audit for Group reporting purposes and two to reviews.
The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.
Together, these audits cover 84% of Group revenue, 79% of Group profit before tax and 78% of Group total assets.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.
The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from 0.2m to 8m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.
The work on 11 of the Groups 15 components was performed by component auditors and the rest by the Group audit team.
In 2015, the Group audit team visited eight of the 15 component locations.
Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with these component auditors and the majority of the others that were not physically visited.
At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail.
