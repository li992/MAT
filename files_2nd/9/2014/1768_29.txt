Small changes in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the size of the deficit.

Future changes in tax rates Under the Finance Act 2013, the UK current tax rate reduced from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014, and will then reduce to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.
This will reduce future current tax charges accordingly.
The reduction from 23% to 20% was substantively enacted before 31 December 2013.
In line with this change, the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities was reduced from 23% to 20%, creating a rate adjustment in 2013, which was partly reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement and partly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2013 were calculated at 20% and this rate continues to apply as at 31 December 2014.

US$500m of the US$1bn 6.375% bond, repayable 2019, has been converted to a floating rate bond utilising a series of interest rate swaps that mature in June 2019 and give an effective rate during 2014 of 4.8%.
The US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, was converted at issue to a sterling fixed rate bond by utilising cross-currency swaps and has an effective interest rate of 7.7%.
On 7 October, BAE Systems issued US$800m of 3.8% fixed rate debt maturing in October 2024 and US$300m of 4.75% fixed rate debt maturing in October 2044.
Subsequently, the Group entered into interest rate derivatives to swap US$500m of the ten-year fixed rate debt into a floating rate to October 2019.
The swaps are at an average rate of LIBOR 1.9% for each three-month period and the initial fixing was at 2.1% inclusive of LIBOR, giving an effective rate during 2014 of 2.8%.
US$500m of the US$800m bond is measured at fair value.
The debt-related derivative financial instruments represent the fair value of interest rate and cross-currency derivatives relating to the US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027, and the US$800m 3.8% bond, repayable 2024.
These derivatives have been entered into specifically to manage the Groups exposure to foreign exchange or interest rate risk.
