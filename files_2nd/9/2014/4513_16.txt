This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
Materiality represents 5.9 per cent of Group profit before tax and 4.7 per cent of Group profit before tax adjusted for the impairment charge of 14.2m as disclosed in note 9 of the financial statements.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess of 175,000 for income statement items, in addition to other audit misstatements we believed warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for Group reporting purposes were performed by component audit teams at the reporting components in the following countries: UK eight components, seven performed by the Group audit team, Kenya and Malta.
In addition, specified audit procedures were performed by component auditors covering three components in the UK two locations and by the Group audit team over a further five components including two in the UK, two in the US and one in Brazil.
These Group procedures covered 91 per cent of total Group revenue: 92 per cent of Group profit before taxation: and 88 per cent of total Group assets.
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at all the key reporting components of the Group were all performed to local materiality levels.
These local materiality levels were set individually for each component and agreed with the Group audit team and ranged from 0.1 million to 2.7 million.
Detailed instructions were sent to all the auditors in these locations.
These instructions covered the significant areas that should be addressed by the component auditors which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above and set out the information required to be reported back to the Group audit team.
