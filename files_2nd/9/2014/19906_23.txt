In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 2.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows.
Valuation of investment and development properties 899.7 million Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 3.1 for the accounting policy and financial disclosures.
The risk Investment properties and investment properties under development are held at fair value in the Groups financial statements, and at every period end the change in fair value is reported in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group engages external experts to value these properties at each reporting period.
The valuation models applied are complex and require consideration of the existing market conditions including yields and estimates regarding rental income, occupancy and property management costs.
Valuing investment properties under development can be further complicated by the need to forecast discounted cash flows with a deduction for costs to complete.
Our response In this area our audit procedures included evaluating the competency of the external experts engaged by the Group to value the investment and development properties, in the context of their ability to generate a reliable estimate of the fair value.
The assessment of the external experts included, but was not limited to, assessing their professional qualifications, experience and independence from the Group.
We met with all the external valuation experts to discuss their valuation methodology.
We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in critically assessing the valuation methodology applied, and considered whether it is in line with accounting requirements and best practice.
We challenged all key assumptions, including yields, rental income, occupancy and property operating costs.
Specifically, we performed our own assessment of these inputs and compared rental income to current tenancy contracts on a sample basis, occupancy to sales reports and property operating costs for a sample of properties through to actual costs for the year.
In addition, for investment properties under development, we compared the costs to complete used in the valuations to internal budgets and business plans and considered the historical accuracy of such budgets and business plans.
We assessed whether the Groups disclosures see note 3.1 in respect of the inputs into the valuations properly reflected the assumptions used and met the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
Classification of joint ventures 383.8 million Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 3.4 for the accounting policy and financial disclosures.
The risk Two of the Groups significant assets are its investments in USAF and LSAV which the Group has historically accounted for as joint ventures.
During the year the Group has adopted IFRSs 10 and 11 which introduced a new definition of control and new guidance on how to classify and account for jointly controlled entities.
Due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements, and the Groups role as manager of the entities, the assessment of whether the Group has control or joint control of these entities involves judgements around a number of significant factors, primarily in the Groups case: the power the Group has to direct relevant activities.
Our response In this area our audit procedures included critically assessing the identification of relevant activities and how significantly they affect returns against our own expectations based on our knowledge of the client: verifying the Groups rights and those of the respective Advisory Committees to direct the relevant activities to legal agreements and reviewing minutes: and evaluating the conclusions reached by the Group, notably as to who directed the relevant activities identified and which were the most significant, against the evidence provided and the requirements of the accounting standards.
We also considered whether the Groups disclosures see note 3.4 met the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
86 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 86 The Unite Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Strategic report Corporate governance Financial statements Other Deferred tax assets 24.4 million Refer to the Audit Committee Report and note 2.5 for the accounting policy and financial disclosures.
The risk The Group has recognised deferred tax assets of 24.4 million 2013: 22.4 million in respect of tax losses considered to be recoverable against deferred tax liabilities and future taxable profits.
In addition a deferred tax asset of 8.9 million has not been recognised due to the uncertainty of future taxable profits and the ability to offset losses against them.
The estimate of future taxable profits requires judgement and interpretation of tax laws as well as estimating future profits.
The recoverability of assets recognised could vary significantly if different assumptions are applied in estimating future taxable profits and the ability to utilise the tax losses.
The risk is that the amount recognised on the balance sheet may be overor under-estimated and any adjustment would directly affect the profit and the effective tax rate for the period.
Our response In this area our audit procedures included, testing the principles and integrity of the model used to forecast taxable profits, comparison of the key input assumptions such as rental income, property operating costs, administration costs, capital expenditure to business plans and considered the historical accuracy of such business plans.
We used our own tax specialists to consider the appropriateness of the application of tax laws, the appropriateness of tax and the ability to offset projected tax profits against the brought forward losses.
We also considered whether the Groups disclosures see note 2.5 met the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 6.5 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of total Group assets of which it represents 0.5%.
In addition, we applied materiality of 2.0 million to revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses, loan interest and similar charges, finance income, share of joint venture profit and taxation, for which we believe misstatements of lesser amounts than materiality for the financial statements as a whole could be reasonably expected to influence the Companys members assessment of the financial performance of the Group.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 325,000, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group audit team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information.
The audit was performed using the materiality levels set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax and total Group assets.
