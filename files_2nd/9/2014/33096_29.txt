The financial statements of Great Portland Estates plc registered number: 596137 were approved by the Board on 21 May 2014 and signed on its behalf by: Toby Courtauld Nick Sanderson Chief Executive Finance Director 144 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2014 Notes forming part of the Company financial statements i Accounting policies Accounting convention The Company financial statements are prepared under UK GAAP and the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investments in subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis as explained in the Report of the directors on page 107.
Subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures Shares in subsidiary undertakings are carried at amounts equal to their original cost and any subsequent movement in the revaluation reserve of those subsidiaries, thus reflecting in the Companys balance sheet the surplus arising from the revaluation and the sale of investments and investment properties of those subsidiaries, limited to the value of the Group balance sheet.
Other investment The Companys other investment is carried at cost less provision for impairment.
Accounting policies for share-based payments, other investment, deferred tax and financial instruments are the same as those of the Group and are set out on pages 116 to 118.
The Company, together with another Group company, contributes to a defined benefit pension scheme for its employees.
The Companys share in the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cannot be readily determined on a consistent and measurable basis.
As a result, the directors consider it appropriate to account for the contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Accordingly, the directors have taken the multi-employer exemption allowable under the accounting standards.
Details of the Groups pension plan can be found on pages 137 to 138. ii Profit attributable to members of the parent undertaking As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The loss dealt within the accounts of the Company was 64.8 million 2013: 1.8 million.
The employees of the Company are the directors and the Company Secretary.
Full disclosure of the directors remuneration can be found on pages 84 to 105. iii Fixed asset investments Investment Shares in Loans to in joint subsidiary subsidiary ventures undertakings undertakings Total m m m m At 1 April 2013 0.1 1,742.6 350.7 2,093.4 Additions 345.7 345.7 Disposals 84.7 23.6 108.3 Surplus on revaluation 316.0 316.0 At 31 March 2014 0.1 2,319.6 327.1 2,646.8 Shares in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are carried at directors valuation.
