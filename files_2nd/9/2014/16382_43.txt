Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial statements 79 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORTS CONTINUED 2 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT In arriving at our audit opinion above on the Financial Statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit key audit matters were as set out below.
These are the matters that, in our professional judgment, had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in our audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
We have communicated these matters to the Audit Committee.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context and solely for the purposes of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not express discrete opinions on these matters.
Revenue recognition The risk Revenue is measured taking account of discounts, incentives and rebates earned by customers on the Groups sales.
Due to the multitude and variety of contractual terms across the Groups markets, the estimation of discounts, incentives and rebates recognised based on sales made during the year is considered to be complex.
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying products have been transferred to the customer.
There is a risk that revenue may be overstated because of fraud resulting from the pressure local management may feel to achieve performance targets.
The Group focuses on revenue as a key performance measure which could create an incentive for revenue to be recognised before the risks and rewards have been transferred.
Our response Our audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the Groups revenue recognition accounting policies including those relating to discounts, incentives and rebates and assessing compliance with the policies in terms of applicable accounting standards.
We tested the effectiveness of the Groups controls over calculation of discounts, incentives and rebates and correct timing of revenue recognition.
We assessed sales transactions taking place at either side of the balance sheet date as well as credit notes issued after the year end date to assess whether that revenue was recognised in the correct period.
We also developed an expectation of the current year revenue balance based on trend analysis information taking into account historical weekly sales and returns information and our understanding of each market.
We then compared this expectation to actual results.
We also considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in note 2 in respect of revenue.
Indirect tax provisions and contingencies The risk Provisions for indirect tax require the Directors to make judgments and estimates in relation to the issues and exposures.
In Brazil one of the Groups largest markets the complex nature of the local tax regulations and jurisprudence make this a particular area of significant judgment.
Our response Our procedures included using our own indirect tax and legal specialists to consider the level of provisions required in light of the nature of the Groups exposures, applicable regulations and the Groups correspondence with the authorities.
We also assessed relevant historical and recent judgments passed by the court authorities in considering any legal precedent or case law, as well as assessing legal opinions from third party lawyers.
We also gained an understanding of the Groups provisioning methodology and challenged assumptions using the knowledge and experience of our own specialists.
In addition, we obtained formal confirmations from the Groups external counsel, where appropriate.
We also considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in note 19 made in relation to indirect tax provisions and contingencies.
Direct tax provisions and contingencies The risk The Group has extensive international operations and in the normal course of business the Directors make judgments and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures.
This is a key judgment due to the Group operating in a number of tax jurisdictions, the complexities of transfer pricing and other tax legislation.
Our response Our audit procedures included testing the effectiveness of the Groups controls around the recording and continuous re-assessment of tax provisions.
Our own tax specialists performed an assessment of the Groups correspondence with relevant tax authorities, to consider the completeness of tax provisions for all relevant risks.
We also challenged the assumptions used, taking into consideration our own tax specialists knowledge and experience.
In addition, we assessed relevant judgments passed by relevant authorities in considering any need for a provision, as well as assessing relevant opinions from third parties.
We also considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in note 20 in respect of tax and uncertain tax positions.
For each risk noted above refer to related disclosure within the Report of the Audit Committee page 56, accounting policies and financial disclosures within the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
80 Financial statements Unilever Annual Report and Accounts 2014 3 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Materiality Based on our professional judgment the materiality for the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole was set at 350 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation of which it represents 4.6%.
We also take misstatements into account that are in our opinion material for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it any corrected and uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 25 million in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Scope of our audit The Group operates through a significant number of legal entities, each of which is a reporting component.
We performed audits for Group reporting purposes of 13 components, as well as audits of revenue and the related accounts receivable balances at a further 5 components.
The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Groups revenue.
The Group has 5 centralised operating centres that perform accounting and reporting activities alongside related controls.
Together these operating centres process a substantial portion of the Groups transactions.
The outputs from the centralised operating centres are included in the financial information of the component entities they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components.
Each of the operating centres is subject to specified audit procedures.
Further audit procedures are performed at each reporting component to cover matters not covered at the centralised operating centres.
Together this results in audits for Group reporting purposes on those reporting components.
The percentages of the Groups Revenue, Profit before Taxation and Total Assets represented by the components within the scope of our work and procedures performed at corporate level are as follows: GROUP REVENUE GROUP PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION GROUP TOTAL ASSETS Audits for Group Audits for Group Audits for Group Reporting Reporting Reporting Purposes 51% Purposes 57% Purposes 75% Audits of Account Audits of Account Audits of Account 12% 13% 3% Balance Balance Balance Out of Scope Out of Scope Out of Scope 37% 30% 22% Components Components Components The remaining 37% of Group Revenue and 30% of Group Profit before Taxation is represented by a significant number of out-ofscope reporting components, none of which individually represents more than 2% of Group Revenue and or Group Profit before Taxation.
A substantial portion of these out-of-scope components utilise the five operating centres and are therefore subject to audit procedures performed at these operating centres.
In addition, for these out-of-scope components, we performed analysis focusing specifically on revenue and operating margins at the aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there are no significant risks of material misstatement within these components.
For the in-scope components the Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the significant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.
The Group audit team approved component materiality levels, which ranged from 5 million to 275 million, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.
The work on all components was performed by component auditors.
The Group audit team visited component locations in the USA, the UK, the Netherlands, India, Indonesia, Switzerland, Brazil, South Africa, Germany, Turkey, Russia, Singapore, China, Mexico and Argentina.
Telephone and or online meetings were also held with the auditors of these components and the majority of all other components.
The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail with component auditors, and any further work required by the Group audit team was then performed by the component auditor.
