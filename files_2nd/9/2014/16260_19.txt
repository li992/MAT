Overview of our audit approach Materiality Overall Group materiality is 6.9m which represents 5% of profit before tax before exceptional items Audit scope We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four components and audit procedures on specific balances for a further five components The four reporting components where we performed complete audit procedures accounted for 45% of the Groups revenue.
We visited all of these locations The five components where we performed audit procedures on specific balances accounted for 39% of revenue.
We visited four of these locations Areas of focus Revenue recognition as a result of inappropriate cut off Recognition of deferred tax assets Carrying value of goodwill Acquisition of Advanstar Changes in finance systems and processes, including capitalisation of, and subsequent accounting for, software costs UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2014 75 Financial Statements Independent auditors report to the members of UBM plc continued Our assessment of risks of material misstatement and responses to those risks The table below shows the risks we identified that have had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team together with our audit response to those risks: Area of focus Response Cross Reference to page note Revenue recognition as a result of For each material revenue stream at each full and specific Refer to: inappropriate cut off scope location, we identified and assessed the design of Audit Committee Report page 51-53 : We focused on this area due to the significant key controls to ensure that revenue recognition was and Note 3.1 page 90 value of revenue for the Group 746.3m 2013: appropriate and applied in accordance with the Groups 793.9m accounting policies For a number of components, we tested controls, including For the Events businesses, there is significant IT application controls lead time in the billing of customers that can We performed substantive procedures and analytical occur up to a year prior to an event taking procedures to validate the recognition of revenue and place.
As such, there is the potential for error related costs throughout the year.
We performed and for management manipulation of the transaction testing over the treatment of deferred revenue timing of recognition of revenue to address the risk of inappropriate cut off.
In performing our work, we tested deferrals from both revenue recognised and invoices raised in the period to gain assurance over the completeness of deferred amounts We tested journal entries relating to revenue that fall outside of our expectations and for transactions close to the period end, we tested that cut off procedures were appropriately applied Recognition of deferred tax assets We challenged and applied professional scepticism to Refer to: There is a net deferred tax asset of 3.3m managements rationale for their reassessment of forecast Audit Committee Report page 51-53 : that relates to tax losses and other temporary models, considered the appropriateness of managements Critical accounting estimates page differences.

We focus on deferred tax assets.

The of the preliminary fair value of the asset and liabilities fair values are based on valuation techniques acquired, and in particular the valuation of intangible built, in part, on assumptions around the assets as prepared by their advisers to conclude on the future performance of the business appropriateness of the valuation.
This included challenge of the key assumptions made by management, such as the discount rates and royalty rates applied.
These assumptions were also benchmarked with historic UBM acquisitions and other transactions in the sector We have also evaluated the costs incurred in relation to the transaction.
In particular, we challenged the treatment of costs capitalised as a reduction to share premium on the basis that they were directly related to the issue of shares under the rights issue to satisfy ourselves that this treatment was in accordance with the criteria set out in IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
We confirmed that all remaining acquisition costs have been recorded as an expense in the year and assessed whether their classification as exceptional is in accordance with the Groups accounting policy as set out in note 3.5 to the Group financial statements New in 2014 Changes in finance systems We performed the following procedures in respect of the Refer to: and processes, including capitalisation CORE implementation and migration in EMEA and the US: Strategic Report page 38 : of, and subsequent accounting for, Audit Committee Report page 51-53 : Walkthroughs of new processes, and identification of key software costs and manual and IT application controls: We focused on this area as the Group has Note 4.2 page 99-101 Review of data cleansing prior to migration, and data invested significantly in a UBM-wide finance migration with associated reconciliations: and reporting system, CORE, which went live in EMEA and the US during 2014 Review of IT access and segregation of duties for all users: Review of managements User Acceptance Testing results: and Assessment of project governance, particularly concerning the decision making process and documentation.
In addition, we challenged the 13m capitalised in relation to software costs in the year to ensure these met the recognition criteria for an intangible asset.
We performed audit procedures to validate the amounts capitalised, to ensure that they included only directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
At each of the go-live dates, we tested that the allocation of costs and commencement of amortisation for each geography was appropriate The above risks are the same as in the prior year, unless stated otherwise.
In addition, Accounting for exceptional items was included as a risk in our 2013 auditors report as the Group had classified a material amount of restructuring and reorganisation costs as exceptional.
