Our audit approach Overview Materiality Overall Group materiality: 31 million which represents 1% of total assets.
Audit scope We audited the complete financial information of each of the Groups four business lines of which Covent Garden, Earls Court and Venues are financially significant.
Area of focus Valuation of central London investment and development properties.
Taxation The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as areas of focus in the table below.
We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material misstatement, warrants specific audit focus on this area.

We used our tax expertise to evaluate tax provisions and potential Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement exposures as at 31 December 2014, challenging the Groups involved in some of the on-going activities of the Group at Earls Court assumptions and judgements through our knowledge of the tax and Covent Garden.

90 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic report Governance Financial statements How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group is structured along four business lines, being Covent Garden, Earls Court Properties including the Lillie Square development, Venues and Other including the discontinued operation, The Great Capital Partnership, each of which is a reporting unit.
The Group engagement team audited all business lines except Venues, where the detailed audit procedures were performed by a separate engagement team.
The Group team issued the Venues audit team with detailed instructions that explained the work that the Venues audit team needed to do and highlighted, in particular, the areas of focus insofar as they were relevant to the Venues business line.
Throughout the audit, the Group team communicated with the Venues team to make sure that we obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall Group materiality 31 million 2013: 23 million.
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied The key area of focus in the audit is the valuation of investment and development properties and the balance sheet as a whole.
Given this, consistent with the prior year, we set an overall Group materiality level based on total assets.
In addition, in recognition of the contribution made by revenue line items to certain key performance indicators of the Group we applied a lower specific materiality of 13 million 2013: 9 million based on a three year average profit before tax for testing net rental income, finance costs and administrative expenses.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 1 million 2013: 1 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors statement, set out on page 88, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting.
The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Groups and Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
