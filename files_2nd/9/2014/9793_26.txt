Governance Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 84 Independent auditors report to the members of Marks and Spencer Group plc Report on the financial statements Our opinion In our opinion: The financial statements fide ned below give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 29 March 2014 and of the Groups pro t and Groups and Parent Companys cash ows for the 52 weeks then ended: The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: The Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited The Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements the financial statements, which are prepared by Marks and Spencer Group plc, comprise: The Group and Parent Company statements of financial position as at 29 March 2014: The Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the 52 weeks then ended: The Group and Parent Company statements of changes in equity and statements of cash ows for the 52 weeks then ended: and The notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of signi cant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
What an audit of financial statements involves We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements suf cient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: The reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates made by the directors: and The overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and nonfinancial information in the Annual Report and financial statements the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach Materiality We set certain thresholds for materiality.
These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be 31.0 million, representing 5% of pro t before tax PBT adjusted for non-GAAP performance measures adjusted Group PBT.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identi ed during our audit above 1.5 million as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at reporting units by us, as the group and UK engagement team, and by other PwC network rms operating under our instruction.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether suf cient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of 117 reporting units, comprising the Groups operating businesses and centralised functions.
We identi ed five of the Groups total reporting units that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, due to their size and or their risk characteristics, providing 80% coverage over adjusted Group PBT.
The main UK trading company contributed 63% of this coverage.
Speci c audit procedures on certain speci ed balances and transactions were performed at a further five reporting units, which include the insurance companies located in the Channel Islands, as the nature of these balances transactions differs signi cantly from the rest of the business.
This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group level, including speci c procedures on the majority of the remaining reporting units, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements and other information Governance Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2014 85 Areas of particular audit focus In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of signi cant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year.
This is not a complete list of all risks or areas of audit focus identi ed by our audit.
We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee.
Their report on those matters that they considered to be signi cant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on page 48.
How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus Area of focus Inventory valuation and provisioning We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used to calculate We focused on this area due to the signi cance of the provisions held against inventory at year end.
We agreed the the balance, complex nature of the calculations and underlying assumptions used in the calculation to supporting the level of judgement applied by the directors in documentation and veri ed the models for mathematical accuracy.
We determining the amount of provision needed to record also attended inventory counts at a sample of distribution centres and the value of inventory at net realisable value where stores.
We tested controls associated with inventory cost price and this is lower than cost.
Impairment of goodwill, brands and stores We tested the directors future cash ow forecasts, including comparing We focused on this area because the determination them to the latest Board approved plans and budgets, challenged the of whether or not impairment charges are necessary assumptions therein and looked at historical performance.
We also involved signi cant judgements by the directors about challenged the directors key assumptions for discount and long-term the future results of the business, especially given growth rates.
In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis around the the dif cult trading conditions in some markets.
The key drivers of the cash ow forecasts, including revenue and trading directors booked impairment charges of 21.9 million margin, to determine the extent of change in the key assumptions that for International stores.
We needed to obtain evidence either individually or collectively would be required for assets to be for the remaining amounts to determine their impaired and considered the likelihood of such change in those key recoverability.

We also assessed the appropriateness of the statements.
disclosures included in the financial statements.
Presentation of underlying earnings We evaluated the presentation and completeness of material or unusual We focused on the classi cation of certain income transactions for appropriate classi cation within the financial statements.
and costs as non-GAAP measures to derive We also tested the material balances disclosed as non-GAAP measures underlying earnings because under IFRSs the by agreeing such amounts to supporting documentation.
We determined determination of these measures is judgemental, whether these items were in accordance with the Groups stated with IFRSs only formally requiring the separate accounting policy.
Retirement bene ts We tested the key assumptions underpinning the valuation of the We focused on this area because the net asset scheme.
We tested the data used in the valuation of the scheme, such position in the Groups retirement bene t plan, along as employee data, evaluated the key assumptions including discount with the valuation of the schemes assets have shown rates applied and evaluated the expertise of the Groups actuaries.
Both the asset valuation and the pension obtained asset con rmations or performed other procedures to verify the obligation valuations are sensitive to changes in completeness and accuracy of the schemes plan assets.
We also key assumptions, such as the discount rate and examined the disclosures in the financial statements.
Risk of management override of controls We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the ISAs UK & Ireland require that we consider this.
arrangements for staff to whistle-blow inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management and the Groups internal audit function.
We tested manual journal entries and considered whether there was evidence of bias by the directors in the signi cant accounting estimates and judgements.
We also incorporated an element of unpredictability into our testing plans.
Risk of fraud in revenue recognition We tested manual journals posted to revenue for indication of fraudulent ISAs UK & Ireland presume there is a risk of fraud misstatements.
We applied data analysis techniques to test revenue in revenue recognition because of the pressure transactions.
We tested controls in the revenue and receivables cycle management may feel to achieve the planned results.
over the accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in the financial The Group continues to grow its business through statements.
We also tested transactions around the year end, in a number of revenue streams.
This increases the particular for UK and International franchise transactions, to check that complexity and inherent risk in accounting for these revenue was accounted for appropriately and in the correct period.
revenues and in particular we focused on franchise and multi-channel transactions given that these are growing areas of the business with additional stores being opened internationally and the new website being launched.

The chief operating decision maker has been identi ed as the executive directors.
The executive directors review the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources across each operating segment.
The operating segments are UK and International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the executive directors.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations.
The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The executive directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating pro t. This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-underlying items from the operating segments.
Central costs are all classi ed as UK costs and presented within UK operating pro t. The executive directors also monitor revenue within the segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segments by subcategory.
UK statutory pro t includes 6.4m last year 35.6m in respect of fees received from HSBC in relation to M&S Bank formerly M&S Money.

These costs are not considered normal operating costs of the business.
We do not anticipate incurring any further costs in relation to this programme: Fair value movement of the Puttable Callable Reset medium-term notes PCR notes realised on the repurchase of debt in December 2007 the Group issued 250m of 30 year puttable callable bonds which included a coupon rate reset after five years based on a xed underlying 25 year interest rate.
On this basis the rate was reset at 9%.
In light of continued low long-term market interest rates and the successful bond issuance in December 2012, the Group bought back and cancelled these bonds in January 2013, resulting in a one-off fair value loss.
This change is the fair value movement of the bond net of any immaterial associated unamortised bond costs and fees.
It is not considered a normal finance cost of the business: The Group has an economic interest in M&S Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, by way of a Relationship Agreement that entitles the Group to a 50% share of the pro ts of M&S Bank after appropriate deductions.
The Group does not share in any losses of M&S Bank and is not obliged to refund any fees received from HSBC although future income may be impacted by signi cant one-off deductions.
Last year, M&S Bank recognised an estimated liability for redress to customers in respect of possible mis-selling of financial products in its audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 with a further estimated liability in its audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Groups fee income from M&S Bank has been reduced by the deduction of this estimated liability under the Relationship Agreement in both the current and prior year and this reduction has been treated as an adjustment to reported pro t before tax on the basis that the directors believe that the impact of the provision recognised by M&S Bank materially distorts the Groups underlying performance.
We are continuing discussions with M&S Bank to determine whether these charges are properly for our account under the terms of our agreement with HSBC.
