This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.

Deloitte & Touche LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors Reading 21 June 2005 Neither an audit nor a review provides assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular whether any changes may have occurred to the financial information since first published.
These matters are the responsibility of the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial information differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
