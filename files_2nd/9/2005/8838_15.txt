82 John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2005 18 Financial instruments continued Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments.
Long-term borrowings are generally rolled over for periods of three months or less.
