62 ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Accounts AR6868 ICI Report 56-70 13 3 06 9:00 pm Page 63 Notes relating to the Group accounts 1 Basis of presentation of financial information These consolidated financial statements have been based on the recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations in issue that are endorsed by the European Commission and effective or which ICI has chosen to adopt early at 31 December 2005 adopted IFRS.
These financial statements also comply with full IFRS effective at 31 December 2005 as issued by the IASB.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are only effective for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 2005: Standards, amendments and interpretations not expected to have a significant effect on the Group include: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures: Amendment to IAS 39 Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intergroup transactions: Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 4 Insurance contracts: Amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds and IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies.
Standards, amendments and interpretations still under review as to their effect on the Group include: Amendment to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: net investment in foreign operation: IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease: IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment and IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2.
These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements in accordance with adopted IFRS and IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Groups transition date for adoption of IFRS is 1 January 2004.
The Group has applied the exemption by the US Securities and Exchange Commission from the provision of a second year of comparatives.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 35.
The Groups accounting policies as set out in the 2004 Annual Report and Accounts have been revised where applicable to conform to IFRS.
The complete accounting policies are set out on pages 56 to 59 of this report.
IFRS 1 permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition period.
The exemptions taken by ICI in accordance with IFRS 1 have been described in the accounting policy to which they relate and are repeated below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented and in preparing the opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 for the purpose of the transition to IFRS, except for those relating to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The comparative figures in respect of 2004 have been restated to reflect these changes in accounting policies accordingly.
IFRS transition exemptions ICI has taken the following key exemptions on transition to IFRS: a Business combinations: The Group has chosen not to restate business combinations prior to the transition date on an IFRS basis.
If the Group had not taken this exemption, the key difference would have been that the accounting for the acquisition of the Unilever Speciality Chemicals business in 1997 would have been restated in accordance with IFRS 3.
The main consequence of this would have been that the goodwill taken to reserves under UK GAAP would have been recognised on the balance sheet under IFRS, subject to an impairment test at the transition date and annually thereafter.
b Employee benefits: All cumulative actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in equity at the transition date.
This is to maintain consistency with prospective Group policy, whereby all actuarial gains and losses will be recognised directly in reserves via the statement of recognised income and expense.
If the Group had not taken this exemption, then the cumulative actuarial gains and losses would have been split into a recognised portion and a larger unrecognised portion.
The unrecognised portion offsetting the post-retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet would be charged to the income statement on a systematic basis over a period of time.
c Cumulative translation differences: One of the requirements of IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates is that on disposal of an operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences previously recognised directly in equity for that foreign operation are to be transferred to the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be reset to zero at the transition date.
If the Group had not taken this exemption, a different amount of net foreign exchange gains and losses would be transferred to the income statement on disposal of a foreign operation.
d The Group took the exemption under IFRS 1 not to restate comparative information in respect of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
As a consequence financial instruments included in the 2004 comparative information are still in accordance with UK GAAP, whereas they are accounted for in accordance with IFRS in the 2005 results.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS, this had been treated as a change in accounting policy.
The accounting policy for financial instruments under both UK GAAP and under IFRS is detailed on page 58 to 59 of this report.
The adjustments made to reserves as a result of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 January 2005 are detailed in note 26.
The resultant effect on opening net debt is detailed in note 28.
If the Group had not taken this exemption, a number of financial instruments would have been recognised or revalued in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2004 and accounted for during the year ended 31 December 2004 in accordance with IAS 32 and IAS 39.
The exemptions ICI has elected not to adopt include the following: a Share-based payments: The Group has not adopted the exemption to apply IFRS 2 Share-based payment only to awards made after 7 November 2002, instead a full retrospective approach has been followed on all awards granted but not fully vested at the date of transition to maintain consistency across reporting periods.
Fair value disclosures in respect of share based incentive schemes have been previously made in the Groups US GAAP net income reconciliation in the Annual Report and Accounts.
b Fair value or revaluation at deemed cost: The Group has not adopted the exemption to restate items of property, plant and equipment to fair value at the transition date.
Such items have been maintained at historical cost in order to maintain consistency with previous Group policy.
Accounts ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2005 63 AR6868 ICI Report 56-70 13 3 06 9:00 pm Page 64 Notes relating to the Group accounts 1 Basis of presentation of financial information continued IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement came into effect on 1 January 2005.
The European Commission has adopted a carved-out version of IAS 39, which excludes certain aspects of hedge accounting.
The endorsement of the full IAS 39 by the European Commission would have no significant effect on the results of the Group.
Continuing and Discontinued Operations For reporting purposes, the results in these financial statements differentiate between the Groups continuing and discontinued operations.
Discontinued operations are components of the Group representing separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operations, or are part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation and which have been sold, permanently terminated or classified as held for sale at the period end.
A component of the Group comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity.
All other operations are classified as continuing operations.
Transactions in these financial statements which are identified as relating to discontinued operations comprise items and associated tax effects in respect of the following operations, all of which were sold or terminated before 1 January 2004: Polyurethanes business, Tioxide business, selected Petrochemicals businesses, Acrylics business, Chlor-Chemicals business, Polyester business and Ethylene oxide business.
Non co-terminous year ends Owing to local conditions and to avoid undue delay in the presentation of the Group accounts, one subsidiary made up their accounts to dates earlier than 31 December, but not earlier than 30 September: additionally four subsidiaries made up their accounts prior to 30 September but interim accounts to 31 December were drawn up for consolidation purposes.
Critical accounting policies, judgements and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Judgements made by management on the application of IFRS that have had a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustments in the next year are discussed in note 37.
2Directors and Officers remuneration and interests The Directors and Officers are regarded as the key management personnel of the ICI Group.

7 Share-based payments Employees share option schemes and other share-based plans ICI currently grants share options and Stock Appreciation Rights SARs under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and conditional awards of shares and for US participants American Depositary Receipts ADRs under the Performance Growth Plan and the Performance Share Plan.
There are also share options outstanding under a number of schemes under which grants are no longer made.
These are the 1994 Share Option Scheme Senior Staff Scheme, the 1994 Stock Appreciations Rights Plan and options outstanding from the Companys savings related all employee share option scheme UK Sharesave.
Awards under the Performance Growth Plan and 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are made to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Management Team.
These schemes are described on page 43.
The Performance Growth Plan makes conditional awards of ICI shares or for US based participants ADRs, which are linked to performance over a fixed three-year period.
At 31 December 2005 the number of conditional awards of Ordinary Share equivalents outstanding under the Performance Growth Plan was 4,060,652 2004 3,902,288.
The number of Ordinary Share equivalents conditionally awarded during 2005 was 1,393,867 2004 1,585,303 with lapses during the year of 1,054,521 2004 546,020.
The 2004 Executive Share Option Plan Senior Staff Scheme grants options that vest and become exercisable providing earnings per share targets over a three-year period are satisfied.
Vesting levels will vary based on earnings per share levels achieved.
There is no retesting after the three-year performance period.
Options under the plan must be held for a minimum of three years from date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The prices at which options are granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan must not be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share nor less than the average of the middle market quotation of an ICI Ordinary Share on the London Stock Exchange on the three business days immediately preceding the date on which the option is granted.
For US participants the awards are made as SARs denominated as ADRs.
Grants are made under the Performance Share Plan to senior staff below the level of the Executive Management Team.
These awards are conditional on preset earnings per share targets over a three-year period.
Awards are delivered in ICI shares or for US based participants, ADRs.
At 31 December 2005 the number of conditional awards of Ordinary Share equivalents outstanding under the Performance Share Plan was 3,803,481 2004 2,133,600.
The number of Ordinary Share equivalents conditionally awarded during 2005 was 1,796,970 2004 2,192,190 with lapses during the year of 127,089 2004 58,590.
Share options outstanding under the 1994 Share Option Scheme were granted subject to performance conditions over a three-year period, which are retested each year until the 10 year terms of the grants are reached.
The 1994 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan grants stock appreciation rights, and on exercise, the gain is delivered in the form of American Depository Receipts ADRs.
Each ADR represents four ICI Ordinary Shares.
Under the UK Sharesave Scheme the price at which options were granted could not be less than the greater of the nominal value of an Ordinary Share, or 80% of the average market value of an Ordinary Share on the three business days preceding the day on which the offer of options was made.
The total purchase cost in respect of options granted under the UK Sharesave Scheme is deducted from salary over a period of three or five years at the choice of the employee.
Awards granted to Directors under the Performance Growth Plan and Executive Share Option Plan are shown in the Remuneration report on pages 46 and 47.
Accounts ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2005 73 AR6868 ICI Report 71-90 13 3 06 9:01 pm Page 74 Notes relating to the Group accounts 7 Share-based payments continued Share-based expense The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment and has elected not to adopt the exemption to apply IFRS 2 only to awards made after 7 November 2002, instead a full retrospective approach has been followed on all grants not fully vested at the date of transition in order to maintain consistency across reporting periods.
The Group recognised total expenses all of which related to equity settled share-based payments transactions of: 2005 2004 m m Expense 7 8 Fair value assumptions of share-based payments The fair value of awards granted is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.
Fair value of share options and other equity instruments and assumptions are shown in the table below: 2005 2004 Share Other equity Share Other equity options instruments options instruments Weighted average fair value 1.10 2.58 0.92 1.95 Weighted average share price 2.81 2.77 2.31 2.22 Weighted average exercise price 2.81 2.31 Dividend yield 2.5% 2.5% 3.0% 3.7% Expected volatility 54% 53% 55% 61% Expected life 4 years 3 years 4 years 3 years Risk free interest rate 4.6% 4.7% 5.0% 4.5% The Group uses historical volatility figures as an input to the Black-Scholes valuation model.
For each new grant, the historical volatility is considered for a period in line with the expected life of the option or equity instrument granted.
The Group assumes an expected life of one year after vesting for options and for other equity instruments the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
Participants in the Groups share-based incentive schemes are not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period.
Therefore, dividends expected on the underlying shares during this period must be taken into account in determining the fair value of share options and other equity instruments granted.
The Group assumes that until each share-based incentive award vests, the dividends per share will follow the same pattern as for the previous two years.
The Group then considers whether any adjustments are required to the expected dividends based on knowledge of the Company.
A proportion of equity instruments awarded to members of the Executive Management Team is based on the TSR performance of the Company relative to a Peer Group.
This market based performance condition is taken into account in determining the fair value of these awards.
It is assumed the market is efficient and hence all available information about the Peer Group performance is already reflected in its share price.
ICI therefore assumes that each company within the Peer Group has equal probabilities of attaining each ranking within the Peer Group.
Movements in the number of shares under option during 2005 comprised new options 2.6 million, options exercised 3.5 million, and options lapsed or waived 5.1 million.
The number of Ordinary Shares issued during the year, wholly in respect of the exercise of options, totalled 0.4 million 2004 0.03 million.
The weighted average subscription price of options outstanding at 31 December 2005 was 2.52.
The weighted average grant price is equal to the weighted average exercise price detailed in the tables above.

The UK taxation charge of 28m 2004 18m is calculated after applying double taxation relief of 33m 2004 15m.
The UK taxation expense consists of 10m credit in respect of special items 2004 10m credit, 2m charge in respect of discontinued operations 2004 1m credit and 36m charge in respect of continuing operations before special items 2004 29m charge.

UK and overseas taxation has been provided on the profits losses earned for the periods covered by the Group accounts.
UK Corporation tax has been provided at the rate of 30% 2004 30%.
The benefit in the period arising from a previously unrecognised tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference of a prior period that is used to reduce current tax expense is 8m, and to reduce deferred tax expense 44m.
The tax credit charge in 2005 and 2004 in relation to special items was in respect of disposal and restructuring programmes, as discussed in note 24.
The tax charge of 7m for discontinued operations 2004 6m credit relates to the profit on discontinuance of an operation, rather than to a profit made by a discontinued operation.

Earnings is the net profit loss for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There are no options, warrants or rights outstanding in respect of unissued shares except for the share option schemes for employees note 7.
Adjusted earnings per 1 Ordinary Share have been calculated to show the impact of special items as these can have a distorting effect on earnings and therefore warrant separate consideration.

In 2004, balance sheet reclassifications of 29m were made between corporation tax payable and deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets of 492m 2004 259m have not been recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over the utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions.
These valuation allowances have been set against gross deferred tax assets of 998m 2004 717m.
The gross deferred tax assets arise as a result of restructuring provisions 8m 2004 10m, pensions 460m 2004 337m, employee liabilities 102m 2004 59m, other provisions 24m 2004 38m, stock valuation 17m 2004 7m, provisions on disposal of businesses 25m 2004 8m, losses 111m 2004 95m, intangibles 50m 2004 47m, foreign tax credits 59m 2004 54m and other timing differences of 142m 2004 62m.
The change in valuation allowances during the year ended 31 December 2005 was 233m 2004 63m and the valuation allowance has been decreased by 11m 2004 6m by a change in circumstances.
Operating losses of 351m 2004 313m are carried forward and available to reduce future taxable income in a number of jurisdictions: these losses have given rise to deferred tax assets of 111m 2004 95m against which are set valuation adjustments of 85m 2004 52m.
3m of these losses, net of valuation allowances, have expiration dates through to 2012 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.
In addition, there are deductible temporary differences of 887m 2004 622m against which are set valuation allowances of 407m 2004 207m.
There are also contingent deferred tax assets related to certain potential capital loss carry forwards that are under discussion with the relevant taxing authorities.
As the extent of those losses is uncertain, management has not quantified them or any related deferred tax asset.
The deferred tax adjustments to net income and net equity to conform with US GAAP are disclosed in note 36.
No taxes have been provided for liabilities which may arise on the distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries on the basis of control, except where distributions of such profits are planned.
Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates totalled approximately 1,174m at 31 December 2005 2004 1,527m.
It is not practicable to calculate the tax which would arise on remittance of these amounts: it would be substantially lower than statutory rates after giving effect to foreign tax credits.

The Company has also provided an asset-backed guarantee, via a wholly owned subsidiary, ICI Receivables Funding Ltd the SPV specifically incorporated to provide the guarantee, for 250m to support the Companys commitments for the ICI Pension Fund see note 33.
The asset-backed guarantee is secured by way of fixed and floating charges over certain trade debtors and cash of Group companies, which have been assigned to the SPV.

Under US GAAP, provisions for liabilities and charges note 23 would be shown under other creditors, split between current and non-current.
21 Current tax liability The current tax liability of 423m 2004 387m represents the amount of income taxes payable in respect of current and prior periods.
Also included within this balance is the provision for potential liabilities for taxation arising in prior years and various tax exposures.
In particular, a provision of 74m 2004 84m exists for the exposures arising from the Groups reshaping and disposal programme and a provision of 60m 2004 71m to cover exposure in respect of transfer pricing issues in various jurisdictions around the world and further provisions totalling 114m 2004 109m in respect of various other tax exposures.
Provisions for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures.
Amounts are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained.
In arriving at this position, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement through negotiation and or litigation.
All such provisions are included in the current tax liability above.

The total provisions before tax included in special items of 319m for these restructuring programmes was charged against profits.
The total included 158m relating to termination of 2,330 employees, 48m to asset write-downs and 113m for other costs.
During 2004 a review of restructuring provisions was conducted, leading to a release of 3m.
At 31 December 2005, 4m of provisions remained to be spent, including 2m relating to the severance of 29 employees.
This provision is expected to be utilised in 2006.
In 2003 the Group undertook a series of restructuring programmes to improve cost effectiveness across each of the following segments: i National Starch staff reductions mainly in administration and the restructuring of manufacturing assets, predominantly across the Natural Polymers Group.
ii Quest staff reductions in the Foods business and in supporting administrative functions and the restructuring of manufacturing assets.
iii Uniqema a major reduction in support overheads and the rationalisation and relocation of manufacturing capabilities in the US.
iv Paints a programme to restructure supply chain activities in Europe and North America.
v Corporate and other staff reductions resulting in a smaller and more focused corporate centre.
The plans focus on manufacturing and supply chain rationalisations and reductions in administrative support.
The total charge to special items in 2003 included 111m relating to the termination of some 2,130 employees, 48m for asset write-downs and 42m for other costs.
2004 During 2004 an extension to the 2003 restructuring programme was approved in Quest following the disposal of the Food Ingredients business.
Revisions were made to the estimated cost of the 2003 programme resulting in 8m being charged in 2004 as a loss on special items, relating to termination of employees split between National Starch 1m and Quest 7m.
2005 During 2005, restructuring was initiated to eliminate further costs in National Starch, Paints and Quest.
Charges of 19m relating to termination of employees were incurred in 2005 and further charges of 9m are expected in 2006, bringing the total charge in special items for the 2003 programme to 231m.
A charge of 2m was incurred by National Starch in 2005, with a further 4m expected in 2006, a charge of 12m was incurred by Quest in 2005, with a further 4m expected in 2006 and a charge of 5m for Paints with a further 1m expected in 2006.

The Group operates retirement schemes which cover the majority of employees including Directors of the Group.
ICI policy, where practicable, is to provide retirement benefits for new employees on a defined contribution basis.
The Company pays pension contributions for each employee into an individual retirement account which is used to provide pension benefits at retirement.
This policy is now in place in the majority of countries in which ICI operates.
However, retirement plans for many existing employees are of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration and are funded through separate  funds.
Formal funding valuations of the Groups main defined benefit schemes are undertaken regularly, by independent qualified actuaries, normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The largest pension plan in the Group is the ICI Pension Fund in the UK which accounts for approximately 80% of the Groups pension plan defined benefit obligations.
There are also other large, funded pension plans in the UK, US, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium that account for approximately 17% of the Groups pension plan defined benefit obligations and other large, unfunded pension plans in the US, Canada and Germany that account for approximately 2% of the Groups pension plan defined benefit obligations.
The remainder of the obligations comprise a large number of small plans, funded and unfunded, located throughout the world in the countries in which ICI operates.
The Group provides in North America, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
At 31 December 2005 approximately 17,000 2004 18,000 current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these schemes.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.

The assumption setting process is based on short and long-term historical analysis and investment managers forecasts for equities, hedge funds and private equity, and the available market yields for bonds.
Mortality assumptions UK Following an in depth analysis of the mortality experience in the two main UK funds Funds carried out as part of the formal valuation of the Funds as at 31 March 2005, it was decided to make a change to the mortality assumptions used in both Funds formal valuations, both in terms of the current mortality table applied and the allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The updated mortality tables adopted as at 31 March 2005 were PMA92C05MC with a 1.75 year age-rating for male members retiring in normal health and PFA92C05MC with a 2.25 age-rating for female members retiring in normal health, with allowance for future mortality improvements in line with the medium cohort.
This change has been carried through into the calculation of the pension liabilities reflected in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2005 for both of the main UK Funds.
The table below illustrates the effect of this change on the expected age at death of an average member retiring currently at age 62 and one who retires at age 62 in 10 years time.
The figures at 31 December 2004 are based on the demographic assumptions underlying the previous formal valuation of the ICI Pension Fund as at 31 March 2003 and were applied in the calculation of the pension liabilities at 31 December 2004.
The figures at 31 December 2005 are those derived from the 31 March 2005 valuation.
Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health.
At At 31 Dec 31 Dec 2005 2004 in years in years Retiring today at age 62 Male 85.0 83.9 Female 87.5 86.6 Retiring in 10 years at age 62 Male 85.8 84.7 Female 88.2 87.3 Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in profit or loss.

The 202m contribution to the defined benefit pension plans include a 122m top-up payment to the ICI UK Pension Fund and a 12m top-up payment to the ICI UK Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
Investment policies and strategies ICI has established a set of best practice principles for pension fund investment so as to ensure a globally consistent approach.
These principles, which have been determined and adopted by the fiduciaries of ICIs pension funds worldwide, include guidelines in the areas of governance, risk budgeting, strategic asset allocation and benchmarks, manager structure and selection, monitoring and other investment issues such as derivatives and self investment.
The over-arching principle clearly states that strategic asset allocation should be determined through explicit consideration of each plans specific liability profile and funding level and not by local common practice.
Furthermore, all plans must establish a strategic asset allocation benchmark, a relevant total plan performance benchmark and a process for controlling deviations from the strategic asset allocation benchmark.
Pension funds are expected to invest in a diversified range of asset classes and investment managers.
These assets may include derivatives up to a maximum of 10% of the individual fund unless a higher percentage is agreed after consultation with the Company.
However, no self-investment is permitted.
Whilst the Company expects to be consulted on these strategic and other matters, it recognises that final responsibility for establishing investment strategy often rests with local fiduciaries, who do not publish target allocations to asset classes.

There was and is no impact on the income statement as a result of this reclassification.
As noted in the basis of preparation on page 63, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement came into effect on 1 January 2005 and the Group took the exemption not to restate comparatives.
As a result of these standards, a number of financial instruments have been recognised or revalued in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005 decreasing reserves by 63m.
The own shares that the Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, to hedge its obligations under various share option schemes, have been included in treasury stock under IAS 32 and debited to reserves on transition.
This has been partly offset by the release of a provision held under UK GAAP relating to the same liability, resulting in a debit of 56m to reserves.
Interest rate swaps and loans previously held at carrying value have been restated to fair value on transition resulting in an additional net debit to reserves of 6m.
There has also been a further 1m debit arising from the inclusion of corn futures in the National Starch business.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Associate reserve The associate reserve comprises profits less losses of the Groups associated undertakings see note 14.
Retained earnings Retained earnings includes net profit and loss for the year and the reserves relating to own shares.
Own shares relate to 4.3 million 2004 8.3 million shares of the Company held by the Imperial Chemical Industries PLC Employee Benefit Trust which are under option to, or conditionally gifted to, employees under the arrangements described in note 7.
The deduction in reserves is 27m 2004 52m and the shares have a market value at 31 December 2005 of 14m 2004 20m.

Any borrowings, cash or short-term investments held by subsidiaries in their capacity as trustee of a Group pension fund are excluded from the calculation.
For the purposes of calculating the basis of the borrowings limits, in accordance with the Articles of Association, the total of the sums standing to the credit of capital and revenue reserves of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, to be added to the nominal amount of the share capital of the Company, was 1,539m at 31 December 2005 2004 1,095m.
The Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, 34.7 million shares or ADSs of the Company to hedge its obligations under the Senior Staff and Executive Share Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Performance Growth Plan and the Performance Share Plan.
4.3 million shares purchased in the market are held by a trust.
In addition, the trust has entered into forward commitments to purchase 26.4 million shares at a weighted average cost of 4.78 per share total balance sheet liability of 126m in 2006, although the trust has the option to roll forward these commitments for further periods if required.
These forward commitments include collateral requirements related to the prevailing share price of the Company.
At 31 December 2005, no collateral is posted with the counterparties to these transactions.
The contracts include the right to either take delivery of shares or to net settle the contracts in cash.
These shares are intended to satisfy requirements for share options exercisable in the period 2006 to 2015.

As reported in note 30, a number of financial instruments have been recognised in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005.
Certain instruments have been included in net debt resulting in net debt being adjusted at 1 January 2005 as shown above.
The own shares that the Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, to hedge its obligations under various share option schemes are included in treasury stock under IAS 32.
The amount included in net debt as at 1 January 2005, reflecting the extent that the contracts are out of the money, is 63m.
Interest rate swaps are now recognised at fair value and certain loans previously held at amortised cost are now adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk.
This resulted in an increase in net debt of 6m through an increase in the value of loans of 14m, partly offset by a reduction in the value of swaps of 8m.
29 Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions On 1 September 2005, the Group acquired the trade and assets of the Celanese redispersible powder polymers business for 15m, satisfied in cash.
The business produces polymer emulsions.
Goodwill of 5m has arisen on the acquisition, reflecting some of the expected synergies to be gained as the acquisition is fully integrated into the business.
The results of the Group for the year include less than 1m of profit attributable to the acquisition.
It is not practicable to identify the revenue and result of the acquired business as if it was assumed to have been acquired at the start of the year, due to the synergies arising from the integration of the business into existing operations.

Disposals On 7 February 2005, the Group completed the sale of the Vinamul Polymers business part of the Specialty Synthetic Polymers division of National Starch for 111m, satisfied in cash, and the control of the business passed to the acquirer.
The net disposal proceeds were used to reduce Group debt.
On 30 April 2004, the Group completed the sale of the Quest Food Ingredients business for 249m, satisfied in cash, on which date the control of the business passed to the acquirer.
The disposal was effected in order for Quest to focus on its flavour and fragrance businesses.

Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements.
The Groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and policies are discussed in the Operating and financial review on pages 22 and 23. a Exemption to restate comparative information for IAS 32 and IAS 39 The comparative information in these financial statements does not comply with IAS 32 and IAS 39 as the Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1.
As a result of these standards, a number of financial instruments have been recognised or revalued in the opening balance sheet at 1 January 2005 decreasing reserves by 63m see note 26.
The own shares that the Group has acquired, or is committed to acquire under forward contracts, to hedge its obligations under various share option schemes, have been included as treasury stock under IAS 32 and debited to reserves on transition.
Interest rate swaps have been restated to fair value and certain loans previously held at amortised cost are now adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk resulting in an additional net debit to reserves of 6m.
b Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2005, after taking into account the effect of interest rate and currency swaps, is set out in the tables below.
Further quantitative analysis of the sensitivity to movements in interest rates is reported in the Operating and financial review on pages 22 and 23.
Hedging Interest rate swaps, denominated in US dollars and Sterling, have been executed to hedge the Groups exposure to interest rate risks in accordance with its interest rate policy.
These swaps are matched in maturity to the underlying debt.
At 31 December 2005, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 2,330m 2004 1,860m.
The maturity profile of the net fixed rate exposure on loans is spread over several years to reduce re-financing and re-pricing risk and matures between 2006 and 2013.
Interest rate swaps including those in effective fair value hedging relationships are measured at fair value under IAS 39.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at 1 January 2005 was adjusted against the opening balance of the hedging reserve at that date.
This amounted to a gain of 8m.
The fair value adjustment relating to loans that form part of designated fair value hedge relationships at 1 January 2005 was a loss of 14m.
The fair value of interest rate swaps recognised as hedges at 31 December 2005 is a net liability of 4m comprised of assets of 17m and liabilities of 21m.
From 1 January 2005 interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges are fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance expense.
Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships are adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through the income statement to offset any mark-to-market adjustment arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
All designated hedges have remained effective throughout the current financial year.

Applying the categorisation rules of financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 the above classes of assets are: 1 Held-to-maturity investments and 2 Loans and receivables.
None of the Groups financial assets, with the exception of derivative assets, are held at fair value.

Interest rate swaps have created a fully floating book during the current financial year in line with Group policy.
The impact on loans, post interest rate swaps, is that interest rates will re-price between 3 months and 12 months.
Short-term borrowings re-price within 3 months.
The sensitivity analysis provided in the Operating and financial review on page 23 indicates the Groups risks in relation to interest rate changes.
The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities.
At 31 December 2005 the financial liabilities of the Group comprised: 2005 m Non-current liabilities Loans 1,072 Derivative liabilities 25 Derivative assets 33 Finance leases 1 Other creditors 39 1,104 Current liabilities Short-term borrowings 14 Current instalments of loans 166 Derivative liabilities 51 Derivative assets 2 Trade and other payables 807 Finance leases 1 Other creditors 1,098 2,135 3,239 Note: Derivative assets relating to interest rate swaps are included within the financial liabilities table as the majority arise through the management of the debt book.
The fair value of the underlying loans and related derivative liabilities are also presented in the financial liabilities table above and to understand the fair value of the overall book it is appropriate to also include derivative assets.

When the underlying item was removed from the Groups balance sheet as a result of a divestment transaction, the swap was no longer performing as a hedge.
To manage this exposure, the Group elected to trade a new equal and opposite swap that effectively closed out its exposure to the original US$1bn swap.
By trading this equal and opposite swap, the Group was in substance terminating the US$1bn swap.
This transaction did however lock in a negative carrying value i. e. a fixed interest expense until the maturity of both swaps in 2007.
At 1 January 2005, as a result of the transition to IAS 39, these two swaps were fair valued through the hedging reserve.
They are fair valued through the income statement from this date onwards, giving rise to very minimal interest rate risk for the Group.
This has resulted in a gain of 1m during the year.
Interest is paid and received in US dollars each quarter.
The interest rate component of cross currency swaps is recognised in the income statement as it is not part of an effective hedge relationship.
Only the foreign exchange component see section e of this note is utilised to hedge net investments in accordance with Group policy.
The fair value movement on the interest rate component in 2005 was nil.
Cross currency swaps have a nominal amount at the balance sheet date of 360m and mature on a range of dates up to August 2007.

The following table for 2004 has been presented in accordance with UK GAAP.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, as defined in section b of this note, at 31 December 2004 was as follows: 2004 m In one year or less 302 In more than one year but not more than two years 172 In more than two years but not more than five years 670 In more than five years 289 1,433 e Foreign currency risk The Group mainly is exposed to foreign currency risk arising on sales, purchases and borrowings outside of Group functional currencies.
All derivatives managing currency exposures are stated in the balance sheet at fair value.
The Operating and financial review on page 23 indicates the Groups sensitivity to currency risks.
Transaction exposure hedging The Group hedges all exposures arising from sales and purchases where markets exist to hedge working capital exposure in line with foreign currency policy.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
All of the forward contracts have maturities of less than one year at the balance sheet date.
Hedge accounting is not applied for derivatives used to manage these currency exposures.
Both the changes in fair value of the forward contracts and the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the underlying monetary items are recognised as part of operating profit.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used to manage transaction exposure is nil at 31 December 2005 2004 1m.
Forecast cash flow hedging In addition to transaction hedging, the Group also hedges foreign exchange exposures arising from firm commitments and forecast transactions.
After 1 January 2005, these transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the defined accounting policy and hedge documentation is prepared for all cash flow hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
Gains and losses on cash flow hedges that have been deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve during the period, in addition to those that have been recycled through the income statement, are shown in the table below.

Note 2: the above table also includes effective commodity price hedges where gains and losses have been deferred to future periods see section f of this note.
The cash flow relating to firm commitments and forecast transactions are all expected to occur in the next 15 months.

Section b of this note shows the currency mix of debt at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 after taking into account the impact of derivatives.
The Group applies hedge accounting, in accordance with the defined accounting policy, for all net investment hedges.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all net investment hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly from 1 January 2005.
The Group recognises gains and losses on debt, cross currency swaps and liquidity forwards in equity, up to the level of net assets in accordance with Group Policy.
For all or part of the year the borrowings have exceeded the net assets on a currency-by-currency basis.
For the portion that has exceeded the net assets, the gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.
This has resulted in a gain of 2m 2004 15m for the year which has been disclosed on the face of the income statement within special items.
f Commodity price risk The Group purchases corn futures in the US and Europe to hedge its price exposure to this commodity.
These futures are accounted for as hedges in accordance with the defined accounting policy from 1 January 2005.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all hedge relationships at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
The fair value of unrealised futures is recognised on the balance sheet.
Once purchased, all gains and losses on futures are capitalised into the carrying value of the raw materials.
The hedges have been fully effective during the period and at 31 December 2005 a gain of 1m has been deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The movements in the cash flow hedging reserve are included in the table in section e of this note.
g Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows comparative carrying amounts are not restated for IAS 39.

Liquidity forwards are hedging debt and are therefore included in the financial liabilities total.
The total decrease in the fair value of long-term debt net of associated hedges for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 75m arose from the net repayment of loans 131m, adverse movements on foreign exchange 101m and favourable movements due to changes in interest rates 45m.
Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics, altering their interest rate or currency profile, the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense accrual accounting.
Loans that are part of fair value hedge relationships see section b of this note are held in the balance sheet at fair value and at 31 December 2005 amounted to 1,170m.
All other loans are held at amortised cost and the carrying value in the balance sheet is 68m, at 31 December 2005.

h Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used, applied consistently, in estimating the fair value of financial instruments reflected in the tables in section g. Derivatives The fair value of all derivatives are estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve in the relevant currencies.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of all the loans is estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a risk-adjusted zero coupon yield curve in the relevant currencies.
A credit spread is added to yield curves to obtain an accurate basis for fair valuation.
Trade and other receivables payables For all receivables and payables, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Securities Where available fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
i Credit risk Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including money market instruments, government securities and asset backed securities.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options.
The majority of asset backed securities have some risk of early redemption, but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk.
There are no investments of a fixed rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value in the Group's balance sheet.
The Group's exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, which is reviewed annually, and reviewing credit ratings and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly.
The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in debt and currency management do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2005 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value assets was 16m for currency swaps 2004 49m, 17m for interest rate swaps 2004 22m and 6m for forward contracts 2004 2m.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks in line with Group policy.
The central funds on deposit at the balance sheet date were 76m 2004 6m.

Accordingly, the financial institution has the rights over amounts included within trade debtors of 196m at 31 December 2005 2004 168m up to a maximum of its loan.
The Company has also provided an asset-backed guarantee, via a wholly owned subsidiary, ICI Receivables Funding Ltd the SPV specifically incorporated to provide the guarantee, for 250m to support its commitments for the ICI Pension Fund see note 33.
The asset-backed guarantee is secured by way of fixed and floating charges over certain trade debtors and cash of certain Group companies, which have been assigned to the SPV.
At 31 December 2005, 268m of trade debtors 2004 251m, 5m of cash and cash equivalents 2004 80m were assigned to the SPV.
The collateral is held against that commitment.

Additional disclosures were given in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Under IFRS, the Group measures pension commitments and other related benefits in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
IAS 19 is similar to FRS 17 in that it adopts a balance sheet approach, bringing the deficit surplus of the pension other post-retirement benefit schemes onto the balance sheet.
However, FRS 17 requires all actuarial gains and losses to be recognised directly in reserves, whereas IAS 19 also includes an alternative option allowing actuarial gains and losses to be held on the balance sheet and released to the income statement over a period of time.
ICI has elected not to adopt this alternative option and therefore is accounting for post-retirement benefits in a manner consistent with FRS 17.
Rather than showing solely an operating charge in the income statement, as was the case under SSAP 24, under IAS 19 a net financing expense is also recognised.
The net finance expense relates to the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the post-retirement benefit schemes offset by the expected return on the assets of the schemes.
Under UK GAAP, the liability asset on the balance sheet represented the timing differences between the SSAP 24 charge and the payments made to the pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes.
Under IFRS, the liability asset on the balance sheet represents the deficit surplus on pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes.
This balance encompasses all assets liabilities arising from defined benefit schemes.
b Share-based payments The Group operates a range of share-based incentive schemes both awards of options and awards of shares that are impacted by IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
Previously under UK GAAP an expense was only recognised for the awards of shares and this expense was calculated based on the intrinsic value the difference between the exercise price and the market value at date of the award.
For all other schemes, the intrinsic value was nil.
Under IFRS, an expense is recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments both awards of options and awards of shares.
This expense has been calculated based on the fair value at the date of the award using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Under UK GAAP, a liability has been recognised for schemes where shares are awarded based on the intrinsic value of the awards.
Under IFRS, the balance sheet entry is based on the fair value of all awards awards of shares and options and results in either a credit to liabilities for cash settled awards or a credit to equity for equity settled awards.
Substantially all ICI schemes are equity settled.

Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, foreign exchange gains losses on intergroup loans are recognised in the income statement, unless the loans can be designated as part of the Groups investment in its foreign operations, when the exchange gains losses can then be recognised in reserves.
However, IFRS is more specific in determining which loans can be designated as part of the Groups investment in its foreign operations, in particular excluding intergroup loans that are not denominated in the functional currency of either the lender or the borrower.
ii Net investment hedge In addition to the above, the Group partially hedges its net investment in foreign subsidiaries by denominating external debt in a mix of foreign currencies.
Under UK GAAP, the goodwill approaching 4bn which was offset against reserves was included as an asset in this hedge calculation.
Under IFRS, goodwill in reserves is not designated as an asset and therefore cannot be used in the hedging calculation.
There is no effect on the balance sheet as a result of changes to the treatment of foreign exchange under IFRS.
d Goodwill UK GAAP required goodwill to be amortised over its expected useful economic life.
Under IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but frozen at the UK GAAP carrying value on transition and tested annually for impairment.
Negative goodwill cannot be recognised as an asset on the balance sheet and should be recognised in the income statement as it arises.
Any negative goodwill held on the balance sheet at the transition date was released to reserves.
Accounts ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2005 117 AR6868 ICI Report 111-124 13 3 06 9:06 pm Page 118 Notes relating to the Group accounts 35 Comparative data restated in accordance with the transition to IFRS continued e Dividends Under UK GAAP, the practice was to recognise dividends in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate, whereas under IFRS the dividend is recognised directly in equity in the period in which it is declared.
As a consequence of this, the dividend creditor is also not recognised until the dividend is declared.
f Joint ventures Under UK GAAP the equity method of consolidation was used, whereby ICIs share of the joint ventures operating results was included in one line in the profit and loss account, with the related tax being included in the Group taxation on profit on ordinary activities.
Under IFRS, joint ventures can be recognised using either the proportionate consolidation method or the equity method of accounting.
ICI has adopted the proportionate consolidation method under IFRS, whereby ICIs share of the joint ventures net assets and results is recognised on a line-by-line basis.
This has resulted in adjustments to key lines in the income statement, although net profit loss is unchanged.
g Business combinations i Profit loss on disposal Under UK GAAP, goodwill that was previously held in reserves was recycled and included within the profit loss on disposal calculation.
Under IFRS, any goodwill held in reserves is not recycled on disposal.
Also, on disposal of an operation under IFRS, ICI will transfer the cumulative amount of exchange differences recognised in equity since the transition date to the income statement as part of the profit and loss on disposal.
Under UK GAAP these cumulative exchange differences remained in reserves.
ii Post-retirement benefits Under IFRS, a post-retirement benefit liability was recognised in relation to Quest Food Ingredients on transition.
This liability was included in the disposal of Quest Food Ingredients during the year.
iii Taxation IFRS applies different criteria for the recognition of deferred tax in relation to internal restructuring.
h Reclassifications i Share of profits less disposals of associates Under IFRS, the share of net profits less losses of associates is shown as a single line item post-tax below operating profit.
Therefore, ICIs share of taxation on the profits less losses of associates has been reclassified from taxation on profit on ordinary activities to share of profits less losses of associates.
ii Share of profits less losses on disposal of fixed assets Under UK GAAP, ICI has shown profits less losses on disposal of fixed assets separately below operating profit.
Under IFRS this item has been reclassified as a component of operating profit.
iii Balance sheet reclassifications IFRS replaces the term cash with cash and cash equivalents, where cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
They usually have a maturity date less than three months from acquisition.
These were included in current asset investments under UK GAAP.
IFRS states that provisions expected to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date should be classified as current liabilities.
This has resulted in a reclassification from non-current liabilities to current liabilities.
IFRS requires computer software that is not an integral part of the hardware to be treated as an intangible asset.
Under UK GAAP, Group policy was to categorise all capitalised software as tangible assets.
This has also resulted in a balance sheet reclassification.
Under UK GAAP, the net deferred tax liability is shown within provisions and the current tax liability is shown within trade creditors and other payables.
Under IFRS, the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability and the current tax liability are all shown separately on the face of the balance sheet.

The move from UK GAAP to IFRS does not change the net cash flow of the Group.
The IFRS cash flow format is similar to UK GAAP but presents various cash flows in different categories and in a different order from the UK GAAP cash flow statement.
IFRS replaces the term cash with cash and cash equivalents, where cash equivalents are defined as short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
In the cash flow under IFRS, overdrafts are also shown within cash and cash equivalents whereas they are included within short-term borrowings under UK GAAP.
In the balance sheet, overdrafts are shown in current liabilities under both UK GAAP and IFRS.

The charge of 29m 2004 36m relating to other intangible assets is due to an amortisation charge of 27m 2004 29m and loss on disposal of a business of 2m 2004 7m.
The amortisation expense for the five succeeding years is estimated as follows: 2006 27m, 2007 13m, 2008 nil, 2009 nil and 2010 nil.
ii Discounted provisions The credit of 16m 2004 13m charge arising on discounted provisions is due to the reversal of the discount unwind discount rate used 4.6% of 4m 2004 3m and a release of 12m 2004 16m increase.

Contingent liabilities The Group is exposed to a variety of events which might result in liabilities arising.
No provision has been made for these contingent liabilities since either the obligations have been evaluated as possible and their existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events, or they have not been recognised because either a transfer of economic benefits is not probable or the amount cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
In particular, no provision has been made for the allegations regarding ICIs former Acrylics business, as at this time there is uncertainty as to whether an obligation exists and if it did, how such an obligation could be reliably estimated.
Details of the Groups contingent liabilities are set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
Taxation Provisions for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures.
Amounts provided are based on managements interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
All such provisions are included in current tax liabilities.
