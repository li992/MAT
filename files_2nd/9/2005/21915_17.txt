As the Board of Directors is comprised solely of non-executive Directors, it is exempt under the Listing Rules from appointing a Remuneration Committee.
The determination of Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the whole Board.
It is the Companys policy to determine the level of Directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to nonexecutive Directors in the industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfill in respect of Board and Committee responsibilities and the time committed to the Companys affairs.
Following a review in 2004 of Directors fees the basic annual fee paid to the Chairman and each Director were increased in line with the Companys peer group to 24,000 and 16,000 respectively from 1 October 2004, with the chairman of the Audit Committee receiving an additional 2,500 for the extra work involved.
The annual aggregate limit on fees payable to the Board of Directors under the Companys Articles of Association was increased on 15 December 2003 to 150,000.
