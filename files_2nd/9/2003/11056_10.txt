The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are recorded under the acquisition method and their results included from the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill arising on acquisition.
Prior to March 1998 goodwill arising on consolidation was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
As permitted by FRS 10 this goodwill has not been reinstated in the balance sheet and remains written off to reserves.
This goodwill will be charged in the profit and loss account on any subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
Goodwill on acquisitions since March 1998 has been capitalised and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, in accordance with FRS 10.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition in 2000 of SAS NewMim and its subsidiaries is considered by the directors to have a useful economic life of 20 years.
Tangible assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost comprises the purchase price of tangible fixed assets together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land.
It is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each fixed asset equally over its useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings Fifty years Leasehold premiums Earlier of the period to next rent review or the end of the lease Leasehold land and buildings Period to end of lease Fixtures and equipment Three to fifteen years according to the estimated life of the asset.
Impairment Tangible fixed assets and investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
The need for any fixed asset, investment or goodwill impairment write down is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of its net realisable value or its value in use.
Leased assets Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal instalments.
Incentives to sign leases, including reverse premiums and rent free periods, are treated as deferred income and are credited to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over the period to the next rent review.
The costs of assets used by the Group held under finance leases are capitalised and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors.
The finance charge is amortised over each lease term to give a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and comprise goods for resale.
42 ANNUAL REPORT 2002 03 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is provided in full on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
ESOP and employee share options The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust, the assets of which mainly comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 13 the assets and liabilities, income and expenses of the ESOP have been included in the consolidated financial statements.
Where appropriate the difference between the market value and the exercise price of an option at the date of grant is charged to the profit and loss account over the period until the option vests unconditionally.
In the case of the Groups Sharesave schemes the Group has made use of the exemption under UITF 17 not to recognise any compensation charge.
Turnover Turnover represents retail sales during the period to customers outside the Group less returns and sales taxes.
Foreign currency The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange during the period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
The resulting exchange differences are dealt with through reserves and are reported in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year, with exchange differences taken to the profit and loss account.
In the financial statements of the Company, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
Derivative instruments utilised include interest rate caps and forward currency contracts.
These are accounted for as hedges, the instruments impact on profit being deferred until the underlying transaction is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Pensions Pension costs charged to the profit and loss account represent the amount of contributions payable to defined contribution pension schemes for the accounting period.

For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Adjusted earnings per share are presented to allow a meaningful comparison with the previous period.

18 TREASURY POLICY AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial instruments The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group only uses financial instruments to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from normal operations, specific transactions and to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to manage transactional currency risks and interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group: it is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Foreign currency risk In addition to specific transactions the Group purchases goods for resale in sterling, US dollars and Euro.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in currency exchange rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty to its transactional costs.
Group policy is to hedge the exposures to anticipated foreign currency movements through the use of forward currency contracts and currency options.

Documents available for inspection 4 Copies of the register of directors interests and copies of the service agreements in force between the Company and the executive directors will be available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered office of the Company on any weekday Saturdays and public holidays excepted from the date of the Notice and at the place of meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting until its conclusion.
Resolution 8: Authority to allot shares This ordinary resolution will authorise the directors to allot ordinary shares of the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount of 3,336,445 being 33% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 19 June 2003.
This authority replaces the authority granted to the directors at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 18 July 2002 and will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The directors have no present intention of using this authority, other than in connection with the obligations under its employee share option schemes.
Resolutions 9 and 10: Political donations These ordinary resolutions seek authority from shareholders to enable the Company and its subsidiary, New Look Retailers Limited, to make donations or incur expenditure which they would otherwise be prohibited from making or incurring following the coming into effect of the relevant provisions of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 the Act.
The Company considers that the authority sought to allow it to incur this type of expenditure up to an aggregate limit of 50,000 for itself and 50,000 for New Look Retailers Limited are necessary, principally to ensure that, because of the uncertainty over which bodies are covered by the Acts definition of EU political organisation, the Company and New Look Retailers Limited do not unintentionally breach the Act.
The Company and New Look Retailers Limited have no intention of changing their current practice of not making donations to political parties in the EU.
However, the Act defines EU political organisation widely to include, amongst other things, an organisation which carries on activities which are capable of being reasonably regarded as intended to influence public support for a political party in any EU member state or to influence voters in relation to any referendum in any EU member state.
As a result, it is possible that EU political organisations may include, for example, interest groups or lobbying organisations concerned with the review of government policy or law reform.
It may, depending upon the issue, be in the Companys interest to support or participate in such groups or organisations and the purpose of the resolution is to enable the Company and or New Look Retailers Limited to do so without inadvertently breaching the Act.
62 ANNUAL REPORT 2002 03 NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING CONTINUED For the purposes of Resolutions 9 and 10, the approved terms shall be as follows: a such authority shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of this resolution unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in a general meeting: and b the Company may enter into a contract or undertaking under this authority prior to its expiry, which contract or undertaking may be performed wholly or partly after such expiry, and may make donations to EU political organisations and incur EU political expenditure in pursuance of such contracts or undertakings as if the said authority had not expired.
Resolution 11: Authority for disapplication of pre-emption rights This special resolution empowers the directors to allot ordinary shares of the Company as if the pre-emption provisions of section 89 of the Companies Act 1985 did not apply, provided that such power of the directors is limited to the allotment of ordinary shares up to an aggregate amount of 500,466 being 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 19 June 2003 other than the allotment of shares pursuant to a rights issue.
This power replaces the authority granted to the directors at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 18 July 2002 and will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Resolution 12: Authority to purchase own shares This special resolution empowers the Company to re-purchase up to 20,018,672 of its own ordinary shares representing 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 19 June 2003 in the market at or between the maximum and minimum prices specified in the resolution giving the authority.
The directors have no current intention to make use of this authority and it will only be exercised if to do so would be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share and is in the best interest of shareholders generally.
Resolutions 8, 11 and 12 comply with the guidelines issued by various investor protection committees of UK institutional investors.
