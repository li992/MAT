Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 42 Accounting policies a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, modified to include the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards which have been applied on a consistent basis for all Group operations.
b Basis of consolidation The results of businesses acquired or sold are included in the profit and loss account from, or up to, the date control passes.
All undertakings over which the Group exercises control or has a dominant influence are consolidated as subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
Associates are accounted for by the equity method and joint ventures by the gross equity method.
c Turnover and cost of sales Turnover is the total amount receivable for goods sold and services provided and is recognised when legal title to the vehicle passes to the customer.
In practice this means that revenue is recognised when the vehicles are invoiced and physically dispatched or when the service has been undertaken.
Financial services interest and leasing income are included within turnover.
Correspondingly, interest expense in respect of financial services is treated as cost of sales.
Turnover is net of any discounts provided for goods and services sold and excludes sales related taxes and intra Group transactions.
Cost of sales includes the expense relating to the estimated cost of self-insured warranties offered to customers.
Trade finance provided by manufacturers, suppliers or related finance houses is treated as a creditor and the cost of such credit is included in cost of sales.
d Foreign currencies The results and cash flows of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average for the year of the month end rates of exchange, except when results are adjusted for the impact of hyperinflation by using an alternative functional currency.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange except where rates are fixed by contract.
The difference between the profit and loss account translated at average and at closing rates of exchange is included as a reserve movement in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation to closing rates of exchange of intra Group dividends, opening net assets, long term foreign currency borrowings used to finance foreign currency investments, and foreign currency borrowings and instruments that provide a hedge against net assets are also reflected as a reserve movement.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
e Financial instruments Financial instruments are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments and amounts receivable and payable on interest rate instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction.
Currency swap agreements are retranslated at the rates ruling in the agreements, with resulting gains and losses being offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowing.
Gains and losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
f Goodwill Goodwill is calculated as the surplus of cost over fair value attributed to the separately identifiable net assets excluding goodwill of subsidiary, joint venture or associated undertakings acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made after the adoption of FRS 10 in 1998 is capitalised and is normally amortised on a straight line basis over its separately evaluated useful life of up to twenty years.
In exceptional circumstances the goodwill may be carried forward unamortised subject to annual impairment tests.
Historical goodwill arising on acquisitions made before 1998 has been charged to the profit and loss reserve.
On disposal, or in the event of identification of total and permanent impairment, a charge is taken to the profit and loss account.
g Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less depreciation, which is provided, except for freehold land, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, mainly at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings 2.0% Short leasehold land and buildings term of lease Plant, machinery and equipment 5.0% 33.3% Major computer software applications 33.3% Land and buildings were last revalued in 1996 on an open market existing use basis by local firms of professionally qualified surveyors in accordance with the Groups prior policy of triennial valuation.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 the Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing fixed assets.
The carrying amounts of tangible fixed assets previously revalued have been retained at their book amounts in accordance with the transitional arrangements, and are subject to impairment tests when necessary.
Diminution in value of individual properties below cost is charged to the profit and loss account.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provisions for impairment.
Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 43 h Vacant leasehold property Vacant leasehold property is provided to the extent of the value of the estimated future net cost.
i Stocks and work in progress Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in bringing stocks and work in progress to their present location and condition.
j Leases As lessee assets held under finance leases are treated as if they had been purchased at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
This cost is included under tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life.
The corresponding obligations under these leases are included within borrowings.
The finance charge element of rentals payable is charged to the profit and loss account to produce a constant rate of interest.
Rental payments arising from operating leases are charged on a straight line basis.
As lessor the net investment in finance leases and hire purchase contracts is included under debtors and represents the total amount outstanding under lease agreements and hire purchase contracts less unearned income.
Finance lease and hire purchase income is allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net cash investment.
Rentals receivable from operating leases are credited to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
k Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full without discounting based on current tax rates and law, on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in future except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding commitment to sell the asset.
l Post-retirement benefits Liabilities under defined contribution pension schemes are charged when incurred.
The Group has a number of defined benefit pension schemes for which contributions are based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Pension charges in the profit and loss account are calculated at a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll, with variations from regular cost spread over the expected remaining service lives of employees.
Other post-retirement benefits are accounted for on a similar basis to defined benefit pension schemes.
Turnover between segments is not material.
6 iii Operating profit before VAT exceptional and goodwill amortisation: Operating profit 139.7 101.9 10.0 9.1 0.9 0.6 150.6 111.
The 0.3m 2002 0.3m joint ventures and nil 2002 0.3m associates goodwill amortisation fall under the UK segment.
Goodwill amortisation with the exception of 1.1m 2002 0.9m in UK Retail, relates entirely to Import, Distribution and Retail.
Note 6 provides a split of the exceptional profit loss by country.
The Groups net assets were reduced by 4.2m in the year ended 31 December 2002.
There were no prior period adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2003.
Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 47 3VAT exceptional Following an announcement by HM Customs and Excise, we submitted claims for overpaid VAT relating to the period from 1973 to 1994.
HM Customs and Excise paid some small claims in 2003 and in February 2004 agreed the vast majority of the remaining claims.
Net VAT recovered of 15.3m, after fees, has been treated as operating exceptional income in 2003.
This has been reported as VAT exceptional for segmental purposes note 1b.
The 22.2m in associated interest is included as exceptional interest income.
We have received legal advice indicating that there are good grounds for some or all of the VAT recovery and associated interest not to be subject to corporation tax.
However, we understand that the Inland Revenue will challenge this treatment.
A provision of 7.5m has been made in this respect.

Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 48 Notes to the accounts continued 5Pensions and other post-retirement benefits a The Group operates pension schemes for its employees in a number of subsidiaries.
In the UK and Hong Kong, schemes are mainly of the defined benefit type with assets held under trust in separately administered accounts.
Some overseas employees are covered by defined contribution schemes which are principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
The Group also has some unfunded arrangements in the UK, the costs of which are included in the pension cost figures below.
The Group has no health and medical plans providing post-retirement benefits for current employees but does have a liability in respect of fifty three past employees under schemes which have been closed to new entrants.
Pensions UK schemes The UK consists of three main defined benefit schemes.
All three schemes pension costs were determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.

The market value of the assets at the date of the valuation was 120.9m, and the surplus was1.9m.
The Trustees triennial valuation of the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme applies a more conservative discount rate than that used by the Group for SSAP 24 purposes.
The Groups valuation is based on the best estimate of the long term return achievable on each of the schemes investments, in accordance with advice from an independent actuary.
This does not impact the future cash contributions to the scheme.
ii Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 5 April 2003 on a market related basis.

Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 49 5Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued a Pensions Overseas schemes The assets of all overseas schemes had a market value of 98.5m based on the latest actuarial valuations.

As at 5 April 2001, the schemes net assets were 239.7m.
The Group has no obligation to fund this scheme except to the extent required under the Minimum Funding Requirement MFR and as at 5 April 2001 the assets covered 117.0% of the MFR.
The Group believes that the surplus in this scheme is irrecoverable and hence the Group balance sheet includes no pension asset or liability for this scheme and no amount is recognised in the profit and loss account for this scheme.
viii If the amounts above had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups balance sheet at 31 December 2003 would be as follows: 2003 2002 Net assets m m Net assets 489.7 398.5 SSAP 24 pension provision excluding defined contribution provision 7.3 7.6 Net assets excluding SSAP 24 pension provision 497.0 406.1 Pension liability 44.8 53.2 Net assets including pension liability 452.2 352.9 Reserves Profit and loss account 210.1 121.8 SSAP 24 pension provision excluding defined contribution provision 7.3 7.6 Profit and loss account excluding SSAP 24 pension provision 217.4 129.4 Pension reserve 44.8 53.2 Profit and loss account 172.6 76.2 Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 53 6Exceptional items charged after operating profit 2003 2002 m m Net profit on sale of properties and investments 0.9 0.9 Net loss profit including provisions on sale and termination of operations: UK Retail dealerships 4.6 1.4 IFS Australia 0.8 Provision release arising from central warranties indemnities note 21 4.0 3.0 Other 2002 includes goodwill written off 0.3m 0.2 1.2 Total net loss profit including provisions on sale and termination of operations 0.4 1.2 Total exceptional items charged after operating profit 0.5 2.1 Goodwill written off included above of nil 2002 0.3m had been charged against reserves in previous years note 25a.

There is tax on the VAT exceptional income and associated interest of 7.5m 2002 nil.
There is no tax on other exceptional items 2002 nil.
Of the Headline deferred tax credit 3.5m 2002 - 4.6m has arisen from the origination and reversal of timing differences.
A credit of 0.3m 2002 nil has arisen due to adjustments to the estimated recoverable amount of deferred tax arising in prior years.
All of the deferred tax charge on the VAT exceptional has arisen from the origination of timing differences.
b Factors affecting the tax charge for the period The effective tax rate for the year of 22.7% 2002 30.8% is lower than the standard rate of tax.
The standard rate comprises the average rates of tax payable across the Group, weighted in proportion to accounting profits.
2003 2002 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 168.3 108.6 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of tax 26.2% 2002 25.1% 44.1 27.3 Effects of: untaxed FRS 3 provision releases 1.2 0.9 non-deductible goodwill 1.4 1.5 untaxed profits 0.5 1.4 losses brought forward utilised in year 4.4 0.7 unrelieved losses 2.3 2.7 permanent disallowable items 5.5 4.0 prior year items 4.0 0.9 short term timing differences 3.9 1.0 accelerated capital allowances 1.0 other items 0.1 0.9 Total current tax charge 38.2 33.5 Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 55 8Taxation continued c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of c. 21.0m 2002 26.0m that may improve the tax rate in future years.
The majority of these relate to losses, mainly arising in the UK, with a smaller proportion relating to accelerated capital allowances and other short term timing differences.
These assets are not recognised because they arise in statutory entities that are currently not forecast to make taxable profits.
There are further potential deferred tax assets, relating to losses, of c. 17.0m 2002 20.0m that are not recognised and are not considered to have any impact on the future tax charge because the possibility of accessing them is considered so remote.
The assets mentioned in this paragraph will only become recognisable if the statutory entities which hold them begin to generate sufficient taxable profits.
There are also losses in Belgium for which an asset of 1.6m 2002 0.7m has been recognised, based on current forecast profits.
The remaining asset of 1.1m 2002 2.5m has not been recognised but should it be demonstrated that sufficient taxable profits are likely to be generated in the relevant company, then the asset will be increased.
No deferred tax has been recognised for deferred tax on gains recognised in revaluing properties to market value.
The total amount not recognised is 1.4m.
Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

This benefit was due to the minority shareholding being acquired before the final dividend was approved.

Headline and basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the respective Headline and basic earnings as outlined above for the year by the weighted average number of fully paid ordinary shares in issue during the year, less those shares held by the Inchcape Employee Trust note 14a ii.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as per Headline and basic earnings per share with a further adjustment to the weighted average number of fully paid ordinary shares to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares comprise share options and deferred bonus awards.

Dividends above exclude 0.4m 2002 0.4m payable on shares held by the Inchcape Employee Trust note 14a ii.
The 2003 interim dividend charge of 9.3m is 0.1m higher than was accrued in the 2003 Interim report.
This is due to the issue of new shares between the date of the Interim report and the record date.

All other goodwill is being predominantly amortised over twenty years.
These periods are the periods over which the Directors estimate that the values of the underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
Disposal of goodwill arises solely from the sale of the Bates Motor Group businesses BMW and Audi and the additions arise mainly from the acquisition of L&C Holdings Limited and two businesses from a subsidiary of William Jacks PLC, as set out in note 28a.
The adjustment relating to the previous acquisition refers to the acquisition of Inchcape Automotive Limited formerly Eurofleet Limited.
At 31 December 2002, it was assumed that deferred consideration of up to 14.3m could be payable, based on challenging EBIT growth assumptions.
Following this years performance, the Group now considers that no deferred consideration will be payable.
Accordingly, goodwill has been reduced by 14.3m in 2003.

In addition, the relationship banks have made available uncommitted borrowing facilities, which are used for liquidity management purposes.
b Borrowings The 40.0m drawn down on the committed revolving credit facility as at 31 December 2002 was repaid in full during 2003.
The 40.0m was disclosed in last years table as repayable over two and up to five years on the basis of the facilitys expiry date in July 2007.
Liabilities in respect of loan notes totalling 20.1m were discharged between April 2003 and October 2003.
These notes were issued in December 2000 and December 2001 following the acquisition of Inchcape Automotive Limited.
At 31 December 2003 0.4m of these notes, at various rates linked to LIBOR, were outstanding.
Net obligations under finance leases are at various local prevailing rates of interest.
As in 2002, the borrowings of the Group and the Company are unsecured.

The warranty periods covered are up to six years and or specific mileage limits.
Provision is made for the expected cost of labour and parts based on historical claims experience and expected future trends.
These assumptions are reviewed regularly.
Motors business exits During 2003, the Group became committed to business exits and terminations which resulted in the charge of 3.0m 2002 2.4m to the profit and loss account.
These included the UK Retail dealership exits shown in note 6.
These business exits will be completed over the next two years and will be broadly cash neutral.
Non-motors business exits Provision has been made for warranties, indemnities and other litigation issues in relation to these exits, based on expected outcomes.
These provisions arise from the exits of businesses prior to the transformation of the Group to a pure automotive services group.
The exits were all completed by late 1999.
Any detailed disclosure of these outstanding claims could seriously prejudice negotiations.
Accordingly, no information is given in regard to the likely timing or cash impact as normally required under FRS 12.
They are however referred to in note 22.
Vacant leasehold The Group is committed to certain leasehold premises for which it no longer has a commercial use.
These are principally located in the UK.
Provision has been made to the extent of the estimated future net cost.
This includes taking into account existing subtenant arrangements.
In determining the provision, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The charge for amortisation of the discount of 0.2m 2002 0.2m has been included in the interest charge to profit and loss account.
The commitments relating to these provisions have not been disclosed within note 23.
Other The restructuring provision principally relates to the cost of implementing new European Block Exemption contracts throughout the dealer network in Belgium.

Joint ventures and associates that form part of Financial Services are financed by borrowings without recourse to any other Group company, except as above.
The Company is party to composite cross guarantees between banks and its fellow subsidiaries.
The Companys contingent liability under these guarantees at 31 December 2003 was 21.7m 2002 18.5m.
The Group also has, in the ordinary course of business, commitments under foreign exchange instruments relating to the hedging of transactional exposures note 29e.
Aon Corporation Aon has made certain claims under an indemnity given in connection with the sale of Bain Hogg Limited in 1996 relating to liabilities in respect of advice given on the sale of pensions and related products, opt outs and transfers by Bain Hogg Financial Services Limited and Gardner Mountain Financial Services Limited.
Aon may seek to make further claims in respect of such advice and related costs.
On the information currently available to the Company, it is not possible to assess fully the merits or value of claims under this indemnity.
The Directors have taken legal advice and are pursuing all options open to them to defend or minimise the claims.
In addition to the above, there were at 31 December 2003 other contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business, including those in respect of disposed businesses.
The Directors have reviewed the above matters and have made certain provisions.
Having done so, the Directors consider, based on the information currently available, that they will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
In September 2000, the European Parliament passed Directive 2000 53 EC which deals with the collection and disposal of vehicles at the end of their life.
The Directive includes a retrospective liability for vehicles put on the road prior to July 2002.
Member states were required to enact legislation by 21 April 2002.
The other member states which are core markets for the Group are expected to do so in the near future.
It is not yet clear, however, how the legislation will work in practice.
Therefore, there are still a number of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of the Directive in our markets and whether it will give rise to a liability for the Group.
The Directors have reviewed this matter and, based on the information currently available, consider that implementation of the Directive will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.

Inchcape plc Annual report 2003 71 29 Financial instruments An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments is set out in the Treasury management and policy section of the Financial review.
For the purpose of the disclosures which follow in this note except for currency risk disclosures in note 29b, short term debtors and creditors which arise directly from the Groups operations have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments which play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk profile of the Group.
An analysis of the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table in note 29c.

The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise mainly 55.2m 2002 50.2m of residual buy back commitments whose weighted average period to maturity is eighteen months 2002 twenty five months and 4.7m 2002 6.3m of vacant leasehold property provisions which have a weighted average period to maturity of six years 2002 six years note 21.

The purchase of these cars is in euros, but is hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts.
Other exposures are principally minor unhedged transactions which are settled within a short time period.
This minimises exchange rate risk and the need to hedge the exposure.

In substance the vehicles remain the assets of the Group and have been included in stock at the guaranteed repurchase price less appropriate provisions where realisable value is lower, with the corresponding cross guaranteed repurchase liability within trade creditors.
The asset side of this transaction is not recorded in the table above because it does not qualify as a financial asset as defined by FRS 13.
The prior year included deferred consideration of 14.3m relating to Inchcape Automotive Limited which has been released in 2003 note 12.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The fair value of contracts of 14.4m represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates, and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2003.
At 31 December 2003 the Group had nominal amounts outstanding of 417.1m 2002 305.6m for these contracts, used principally to hedge future purchases in foreign currency.
