report of the independent auditors INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF CABLE AND WIRELESS PLC We have audited the financial statements of Cable and Wireless plc which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the continuing operations profit and loss account, the discontinued operations profit and loss account, the consolidated balance sheet, the Company balance sheet, the consolidated cash ow statement, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses, the reconciliation of movements in consolidated equity shareholders funds, the reconciliation of movement in equity shareholders funds for the Company, the statement of accounting policies and notes 1 to 36.
We have also audited the information in the Directors Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors Remuneration Report.
As described in the statement of Directors Responsibilities this includes responsibility for preparing the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards: the Directors have also presented additional information under US requirements.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditor, are established in the UK by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and by our professions ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors Report is not consistent with the Financial Statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the Directors Remuneration Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial Statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Financial Statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatements, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited.
Page 80 report of the independent auditors Opinion In our opinion: r the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 March 2003 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended: and r the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Page 89 statement of accounting policies STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of investments in subsidiaries in the Companys accounts.
The accompanying consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom UK GAAP which differ in certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States US GAAP, see Note 36 Summary of differences between United Kingdom and United States GAAP.
The preparation of Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
New accounting standards The Group sells network capacity to third parties pursuant to indefeasible rights-of-use agreements IRUs.
In prior periods, in accordance with UK accounting standards, where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the purchaser, over the economic life of the asset, these transactions were accounted for as sales and recognised in turnover at fair value at the time of delivery and acceptance.
On 27 March 2003, the Urgent Issues Task Force UITF of the UK Accounting Standards Board issued UITF Abstract 36, Contracts for sales of capacity.
The abstract is applicable for accounting periods ending on or after 30 June 2003, although early adoption is encouraged, and application is retrospective.
The Group has adopted UITF Abstract 36 for the year ended 31 March 2003.
As a result of the adoption of the new abstract, revenues or gains in respect of capacity sales to carriers from whom capacity or other services were also acquired are no longer recognised as the transactions are not considered to meet all the conditions required under the new abstract, in particular the requirement for the capacity provided or received to have a readily ascertainable market value as set out in Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
The Groups cash sales to carriers with no related purchase are largely unaffected by the conditions of the new abstract and will continue to be recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance.
The impact of adoption on the reported results of the Group is set out in Note 4 to the Financial Statements, including the impact on prior period comparatives as the abstract applies retrospectively.
The revised accounting policy is set out on page 92.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts comprise a consolidation of the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries and include the Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates.
The accounts of principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are made up to 31 March.
Where subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates have been acquired during the year, goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration given and the fair values attributed to the separable net assets acquired, is capitalised on the balance sheet and amortised through the profit and loss account.
For acquisitions made before 1 April 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill written off directly to reserves is reinstated in the profit and loss account when the related business is sold.
Page 90 statement of accounting policies Foreign currencies Average rates of exchange ruling during the year are used to translate the profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at year end rates and any exchange differences arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
The net investments in the Groups overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling at year end rates of exchange.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation of opening net investments at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the year, together with the differences between profit and loss accounts translated at average rates and year end rates, are dealt with as movements in Group reserves.
Where net investments are matched in whole or in part by foreign currency borrowings, the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of such borrowings are also recorded as movements on Group reserves and any excess taken to the profit and loss account.
All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Tangible xed assets and depreciation Tangible xed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
The cost of xed assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs.
Interest incurred up to the time that separately identiable major capital projects are ready for service is also capitalised as part of the cost of assets.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or projects under construction.
On other tangible xed assets, depreciation is provided on the difference between the cost of tangible xed assets and the estimated residual value, in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
These lives are: Lives Average Cables up to 20 years 15 years Network equipment 3 to 25 years 8 years Ducting 40 years 40 years Freehold buildings 40 years 40 years Leasehold land and buildings up to 40 years or term of lease if less 40 years Surpluses and deficits on disposals of tangible xed assets are determined by reference to sale proceeds and net book values.
Intangible xed assets From 1 April 1998 intangible xed assets acquired have been recorded at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life, not exceeding 20 years.
Intangible xed assets primarily comprise goodwill arising on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill arising on acquisition prior to 1 April 1998 was eliminated directly against reserves.
The profit or loss on the disposal of all or part of a previously acquired business is calculated after taking account of the gross amount of any goodwill previously eliminated directly against reserves.
Asset impairment Intangible and tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the xed asset may not be recoverable.
Where an impairment indicator is identied, the carrying value of the income generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised.
Page 91 statement of accounting policies Fixed asset investments Joint ventures and associates are accounted for in the Group accounts under the gross equity and equity methods of accounting respectively.
Other xed asset investments in the Group accounts are stated at cost less amounts written off in respect of any impairments.
Investments in subsidiaries are included in the Company balance sheet at valuation.
Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tax The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Stocks Stocks of equipment, held for use in the maintenance and expansion of the Groups telecommunications systems, are stated at cost, including appropriate allocation of labour and overheads, less provision for deterioration and obsolescence.
Stocks held for resale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discontinued operations The Group complies with Financial Reporting Standard 3 FRS 3, Reporting financial performance, in determining the classication of operations as discontinued or continuing.
Revenue recognition Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the amount receivable in respect of telecommunications services provided to customers and is accounted for on the accruals basis.
Amounts are recognised as services are provided: in respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service.
Interconnection with other operators Amounts payable by and to telecommunications operators of national and international networks are recognised as services are provided.
Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continuous review.
Capacity sales Sales of network capacity to third parties pursuant to IRUs are accounted for as sales and recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance where: Page 92 statement of accounting policies r the purchasers right of use is exclusive and irrevocable: r the asset is specic and separable: r the term of the contract is for the major part of the assets useful economic life: r the attributable cost of carrying value can be measured reliably: and r no significant risks are retained by the Group.
Capacity sales are made out of network capacity and infrastructure held for re-sale stock.
Transfers are made from xed assets to stock at cost on completion of construction based on an estimate of what will be sold to third parties under IRU contracts which typically form part of the original investment criteria.
The cost of the construction is apportioned on a pro rata basis between stock and xed assets.
Income relating to operations and maintenance contracts is spread over the period of the contract.
Revenues or gains in respect of contracts involving the provision of capacity in exchange for receiving capacity, or other services, are not recognised on the basis that the capacity does not have a readily ascertainable market value as dened in accounting standards.
Pensions The regular cost of providing benets under dened benefit schemes is charged to operating profit over the expected remaining service lives of the members of the schemes so as to achieve a constant percentage of pensionable pay.
Variations from the regular cost arising from periodic actuarial valuations of the principal dened benefit schemes are allocated to operating profit over the expected remaining service lives of the members.
The cost of providing benets under dened contribution schemes is charged as it becomes payable.
The Group has applied the transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement benets and appropriate additional disclosures have been included in Note 8.
Leased assets Where assets are nanced by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease term.
The corresponding lease commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest elements using the annuity method.
Depreciation on the relevant assets and interest are charged to the profit and loss account.
All other leases are operating leases and the rentals are charged to operating profit on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Debt issue costs The costs of issue of capital instruments such as bonds and debentures are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument.
Derivatives Swaps and forward rate agreements The net interest paid or received under interest rate and cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements FRAs is recorded on an accruals basis and included within net interest in the profit and loss account.
The notional amounts of interest rate swaps and FRAs are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Cross currency swaps are used to hedge the initial draw down and final repayment of foreign currency denominated debt, as well as the foreign currency interest ows.
Page 93 statement of accounting policies Forward exchange contracts Forward exchange contracts are carried on the balance sheet at the difference between the amounts of the payable and receivable currency revalued at the closing exchange rate.
The interest differential, being the difference between the contract rate and the spot rate on the date of entering into the forward exchange contract, is charged to the profit and loss account as interest over the life of the contract.
Exchange gains and losses Exchange gains and losses on revaluation and maturity of forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps are treated differently depending on the underlying exposure they hedge: r for contracts which hedge rm third party commitments the exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying transaction: r for contracts over underlying currency assets or liabilities the exchange gains and losses are off-set against the equal and opposite exchange gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the underlying assets or liabilities: r for contracts taken out to hedge overseas equity investments the exchange gains and losses are taken to reserves to offset against the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the net assets of the investments on consolidation: and r for contracts which hedge general trading ows the exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.
Where the underlying exposure changes, or ceases to exist, the contract would be terminated and the exchange gain or loss arising taken to the profit and loss account.
