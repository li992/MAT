The pension cost under SSAP 24 for the final salary section of the UK Scheme has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Hewittt Bacon & Woodrow, and is based on a valuation of the UK Scheme as at 1st January 2003.
This valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.
The principal financial assumptions used to calculate the pension cost were that inflation would average 2.3% per annum and that pension increases and pay increases would average 0.2% per annum and 1.5% per annum above inflation.
A discount rate of 5.5% before retirement and 4.75% after retirement was used.
Assets were taken at market value together with an adjustment that phased in over three years the UK Schemes assets underperformance versus a notional portfolio constructed to match the liabilities of the UK Scheme.
This SSAP 24 valuation showed that the market value of the assets of the final salary section was 302 million.
After allowing for the underperformance adjustment, the assets represented 106% of the liabilities.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of regular costs of the UK Scheme was 13.1 million 11.7 million less the variation of 1.1 million 10.8 million for the amortisation of the surplus over the average remaining service lives of the active employees, using the percentage of payroll method.
The net pension cost charged was 11.4 million 0.5 million which incorporated a small reduction of 0.6 million 0.4 million in respect of the balance sheet prepayment at the start of the year.
The main reason for the significant increase in the net pension cost for 2003 over that charged for 2002, was the worldwide fall in equity values which reduced the SSAP 24 surplus in the UK Scheme with a corresponding decrease in the variation credit.
Over the year, the contributions to the final salary section of the UK Scheme totalled 15.8 million 4.6 million.
The balance sheet prepayment at 31st December 2003 was 15.6 million 11.2 million.
The Group operates a number of smaller non-material pension schemes around the world, some of which are funded defined benefits schemes with valuations performed regularly by qualified actuaries, the actuarial assumptions varying according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the funds are situated.
In addition, there are several defined contribution schemes.

Financial instruments are used within the Group where it is considered that the sterling values of such amounts are at risk.
In such cases, forward currency contracts with fair values at the balance sheet date of 1.3 million 0.2 million were being used to hedge foreign currency assets.
In relation to the Groups hedging of its seed and liquid capital investments, at 31st December 2003, the Group had futures contracts with fair values of 0.5 million nil hedging investments against market movements and forward currency contracts with fair values of 12.1 million 0.2 million hedging investments against currency movements.
The increase in the use of forward currency contracts is due principally to the investment of liquid capital in U. S. fixed income securities hedged to sterling.
The Group has a policy of hedging certain exposures as and when they arise.
Gains and losses made on hedges are recognised by marking to market, except for certain Private Banking transactions which are not deemed to be material.
