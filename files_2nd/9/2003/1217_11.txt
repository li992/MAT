Independent auditors report to the members of ARM Holdings plc UK GAAP We have audited the financial statements on pages 32 to 55 which have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out on pages 36 to 38.
We have also audited the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, contained in the directors remuneration report the auditable part.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Group has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
The other information comprises only ARM at a glance, the Chairmans statement, the Chief Executive Officers review, ARM: connected, directors and advisers, financial review, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, the directors report and the unaudited part of the remuneration report.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code issued in June 1998 specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups or Companys corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company at 31 December 2003 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended: the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985: and those parts of the directors remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 35 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP 1 Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the UK.
A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18, Accounting policies, is set out below together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Changes in accounting policies The Group has adopted Urgent Issues Task Force UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, in these financial statements.
The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly see note 20 and the share schemes accounting policy below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2003.
Intra-Group transactions and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill and intangible assets Purchased goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from it.
Goodwill amortisation periods are determined on a case-by-case basis see note 11.
Provision is made against the carrying value of goodwill where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Licences and patents purchased for the use of technology are capitalised and amortised over the period in which the Group is expected to benefit from them.
These periods range from three to five years.
Trade investments Trade investments are initially recorded at cost.
There is a regular review of the carrying value of investments, with reference to relevant financial information and industry conditions: impairment charges are recorded if there is evidence of impairment in value to reduce the carrying value of the investments to the market value of the shares held.
Short-term investments Bank deposits which are not repayable on demand are treated as short-term investments in accordance with FRS 1, Cash flow statements.
Movements in such investments are included under management of liquid resources in the Groups cash flow statement.
Pension scheme arrangements The Group contributes to defined contribution plans, covering substantially all employees in Europe and the United States, and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated from the date that they come into use.
The principal useful economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
Turnover The Group follows the principles of FRS 5 Application Note G in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies.
In principle, therefore, revenue is recognised to the extent that the Group has obtained the right to consideration through its performance.
The adoption of FRS 5 Application Note G has had no impact on amounts received as revenue in this or the previous year.
Turnover excluding VAT comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees ARM-based products, revenues from support, maintenance and training, and consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer.
Revenue from the sale of such licences is recognised on a  basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
The percentage to completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance.
36 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 1 Principal accounting policies continued Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the proportion of work performed calculated on the cost basis described above is greater than the proportion of the total contract value which has been invoiced, the Group evaluates whether it has obtained, through its performance to date, the right to the uninvoiced consideration and therefore whether revenue should be recognised.
In particular it considers: whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way dependent on customer activity: whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled: whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future invoice may be raised: and the extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it has the right to consideration, taking into account these criteria, revenue is not recognised until there is sufficient evidence that the Group has obtained the right to consideration for its performance under such arrangements.
Where agreements involve multiple elements, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual elements based on each elements fair value.
Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers where elements are sold separately.
Agreements including rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognised over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product.
In those cases where the Group makes sales of these products, the total value of the licence is recorded as turnover and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Group records as turnover the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-contract support support, maintenance and training which consists of an identified customer contact at the Group and telephonic or e-mail support.
Fees for post-contract support which take place after customer acceptance are specified in the contract.
The fees are determined based on the Groups price list as if sold separately.
The price list is established and regularly reviewed by management.
Revenue for post-contract support is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Group with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees and post-contract support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence such as off-the-shelf software are recognised upon delivery.
At that time, the Group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post-contract support have been accrued.
Services such as training that the Group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately.
Revenue is recognised as services are performed and collectability is probable.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Groups customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognised when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
As disclosed above, in accordance with FRS 18, Accounting policies, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of the  method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, customer acceptance is not uncertain.
In addition, when allocating revenue to various elements of multi-element arrangements, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation, using full provision accounting when an event has taken place by the balance sheet date which gives rise to an increased or reduced tax liability in the future, in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred taxation.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currency The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies are taken to reserves and reported in the statement of Group total recognised gains and losses.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences have been included in operating profit.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 37 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments The Group attempts to reduce its foreign currency exposure by entering into forward contracts to sell US dollars and buy sterling.
The Group accounts for these instruments by revaluing the financial instruments and the associated trade debtors and cash at the year-end rate.
The resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to the profit and loss account for the year.
Research and development All research and development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Share schemes The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are separately administered trusts which are funded by loans the ESOP and loans and gifts the QUEST from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 38, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees see note 20.
In accordance with the requirements of UITF 17, Employee share schemes, a charge is made in the profit and loss account representing the fair value at the date of grant of shares awarded under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan.
As the award is conditional on certain performance conditions being met, this is reflected in the number of shares on which the charge is calculated.
The charge is credited back to reserves.
The Company operates a Save As You Earn scheme together with a similar scheme for US employees that allows the grant of share options at a discount to the market price at the date of grant.
The Company has made use of the exemption under UITF 17 not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of these options.
Employers National Insurance and similar taxes arise on the exercise of certain share options.
In accordance with UITF 25 a provision is made, calculated using the market price of the Companys shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to the profit and loss account to match the projects related expenditure.
Provision for doubtful debts Provision is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
2 Segmental analysis The directors are of the opinion that the Group has only one class of business.
38 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 2 Segmental analysis continued Net assets 2003 2002 000 000 Europe 169,305 159,872 United States 7,267 6,787 Asia Pacific 3,863 6,322 180,435 172,981 The prior years figures have been restated solely as a result of the adoption of UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP trusts see note 20.

Additionally, due to a change in pension scheme within ARM Belgium N. V. effected post-acquisition, the pension provision in existence at acquisition has been released to the profit and loss account and the credit of 1,069,000 is not included in the above numbers.
Of the total pension costs above, 47,000 2002: nil remained unpaid at the year end.
6 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation Profit on ordinary activities before taxation is stated after charging crediting : 2003 2002 000 000 Depreciation charge for the year: Tangible owned fixed assets 12,908 12,463 Amortisation of goodwill 1,299 1,352 Amortisation of other intangible assets 3,342 2,777 Impairment of fixed asset investments 622 826 Profit on disposal of fixed assets 6 14 Auditors remuneration: Audit services statutory audit Company: 5,000 2002: 5,000 166 157 audit-related regulatory reporting 51 42 Further assurance services royalty audits 72 4 other advisory work 13 7 Tax compliance and advisory work 87 37 Hire of plant and machinery operating leases 4,433 1,736 Leased buildings operating leases 3,736 3,463 Fees to other major firms of accountants for non-audit services amounted to 260,000 2002: 114,000.

40 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 7 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 2003 2002 000 000 Current UK corporation tax at 30% 2002: 30% 8,162 12,846 Overseas corporation tax 1,009 1,106 Under over provision in respect of prior years: UK corporation tax 72 5 Overseas corporation tax 18 68 9,225 13,889 Deferred UK deferred tax origination and reversal of timing differences 1,622 500 Overseas deferred tax origination and reversal of timing differences 374 358 Subtotal 1,248 858 7,977 13,031 The taxation charge for 2003 was reduced by 766,000 2002: 754,000 in relation to tax losses generated by overseas subsidiaries.
Under legislation introduced with effect from 1 April 2002, the tax charge is affected by the availability of UK research and development tax credits.
The tax impact is a reduction in the tax charge for the year of 958,000 2002: 781,000.
The current tax charge for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The differences are explained below: 2003 2002 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 23,240 45,502 Taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 30% 6,972 13,651 Effects of: Under over provision in respect of prior years 54 63 Accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences 1,638 692 Permanent differences 1,202 267 Higher average tax rates in overseas countries 8 8 Losses utilised during the year 633 650 Current tax charge for the year 9,225 13,889 The analysis of the deferred tax asset movement for the Group is as follows: Deferred Deferred tax asset tax asset 2003 2002 000 000 At 1 January 1,697 839 Asset relating to losses acquired with subsidiary undertaking see note 22 640 Credited to the profit and loss account 1,248 858 At 31 December 3,585 1,697 The analysis of deferred tax assets for the Group is as follows: Amount recognised Amount not recognised 2003 2002 2003 2002 000 000 000 000 Tax effect of timing differences because of: Excess of tax allowances over depreciation 2,844 1,193 Losses carried forward 395 420 544 Other 346 504 83 15 3,585 1,697 503 559 No provision is made for taxation liabilities which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries because there is no intention in the foreseeable future that such profits will be remitted.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for the amounts unprovided because of the uncertainty of utilising these losses in the future.
The Company has no potential liability for deferred taxation.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 41 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 8 Profit for the financial year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent companys profit after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was 10,546,000 2002: 772,000.
9 Dividends proposed 2003 2002 000 000 Interim and final proposed of 0.6 pence 2002: nil per ordinary share 6,106 The ESOP trust has waived its right to receive dividends of over 0.01 pence per share, and the QUEST has waived its right to receive any dividends.
As such, dividends will not be payable on the 5,721,080 shares currently held within these trusts.
10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year, being those share options granted to employees and directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
For 2003, no shares that have been allocated for awards under the LTIP have been included in the diluted EPS calculation as the performance criteria cannot be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2003 2002 Number Per share Number Per share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount 000 Thousands Pence 000 Thousands Pence Basic EPS Profit available to ordinary shareholders 15,158 1,016,484 1.5p 32,239 1,012,295 3.2p Effect of dilutive securities: Options 16,797 8,465 Diluted EPS Adjusted earnings 15,158 1,033,281 1.5p 32,239 1,020,760 3.2p 11 Intangible fixed assets Patents and licences Goodwill Total Group 000 000 000 Cost At 1 January 2003 12,245 5,744 17,989 Additions see note 22 655 2,380 3,035 At 31 December 2003 12,900 8,124 21,024 Aggregate amortisation At 1 January 2003 4,102 4,734 8,836 Charge for the year 3,342 1,299 4,641 At 31 December 2003 7,444 6,033 13,477 Net book value At 31 December 2003 5,456 2,091 7,547 At 31 December 2002 8,143 1,010 9,153 The Group has patents and licences which are being amortised over three to five years.

These are managed, respectively, through the use of hedging strategies primarily forward contracts, money market instruments and an ongoing process of assessing potential trade investments and current holdings.
To meet these objectives the Group has used the policies described below which have been applied throughout the current year.
Management of foreign exchange risk The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while the majority of its costs are settled in sterling.
The Group seeks to use forward contracts to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group enters into forward contracts which allow exercise between two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date.
In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the foreign exchange contract, the Group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments.
It then seeks to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against forward contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the prevailing money market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time.
At 31 December 2003 the Group had outstanding forward contracts to sell $44,000,000 2002: $54,000,000.
The Group had $28,591,000 2002: $33,293,000 of trade debtors denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash balances of $26,340,000 2002: $28,645,000.
Thus 20% 2002: 13% of the Groups US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching forward contracts at the year end, a proportion considered appropriate in the light of the anticipated US dollar requirements to settle liabilities, particularly in respect of overseas operations.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in euros, primarily in its French and Belgian subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out euro forward contracts.
The Group, where required, invests profits in the subsidiary in which they were earned.
The Group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.
After the year end, the Group has decided to consider the use of other financial instruments such as currency options.
Maximisation of return on funds held on deposit The Groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
It aims to maximise returns from funds held on deposit and uses money market deposits with major financial institutions to do so.
Recent maturities have been up to six months in length, but this varies since close consideration is given to the UK and US money market yield curves before contracts are closed.
Trade investments Investment activity is intended to create long-term strategic alliances with development companies, some of which may be unlisted at the time of the investment decision.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for these securities or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The directors review holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group.
Funds for such ventures are strictly limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline in the value of investments would not be substantial in the context of the Groups financial results.
During 2003, the Group made a further investment in Superscape Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group holds investments in four private companies: Pixim, Inc. CoWare, Inc. Palmchip Corporation and Cambridge Silicon Radio Holdings Limited, which all develop products based on ARM technology.
External borrowings The Group had no long-term debt and no undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2003 2002: nil or during the financial year.
Numerical disclosures Numerical disclosures are set out in the tables below.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures.

Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents.
Financial liabilities Provisions for National Insurance and similar taxes of 63,000 2002: 16,000 are financial liabilities in sterling on which no interest is paid.
Maturity depends on when certain share options are exercised.
Fair values of financial instruments Cash and short-term investments The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The fair value of forward contracts is estimated at 2,015,000 at 31 December 2003 2002: 1,061,000.
The increase is due to changes in the sterling US dollar exchange rate in 2003.
Investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which ARM has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits.
The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Groups investments in unlisted companies carrying value at 31 December 2003: 2,107,000 as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2003.
On this basis, the fair value of the Groups listed investment was 4,139,000 at 31 December 2003 2002: 1,500,000.
Provisions The carrying amount of 63,000 approximates to fair value as this is the amount which would be payable if the liability had crystallized at the balance sheet date.
Currency exposure The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency, net of forward contracts.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the individual companies and the Group.

The provision fluctuates with movements in share price and the exercise of the share options.
Pension provision The pension provision, acquired with ARM Belgium N. V. has been fully released to the profit and loss account post-acquisition following the transfer by all relevant employees from the original defined benefit scheme to a new defined contribution scheme, resulting in the deficit being extinguished.

The issue of these shares occurred on the exercise of share options at various times during the year.
Options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
These options will vest after seven years unless certain criteria are met, in which case they will vest between three and seven years.
Under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan, a further 2,572,646 shares could be awarded to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year period as detailed in the remuneration report.
These shares will be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 49 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 20 Share premium account and reserves continued Prior year adjustment The Group has adopted UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, during the year by means of a prior year adjustment.
There is no effect on the current or prior years profit for either the Group or Company.
As a result of the change in accounting policy, the cost of own shares held is presented as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
Previously, own shares held were included within investments and were stated at the lower of cost and amounts receivable from the exercise of options, where applicable, and market value.
The effect for 2002 is to decrease shareholders funds and investments at 31 December 2002 by 2,166,000 1,438,000 in respect of the ESOP and 728,000 in respect of the QUEST in both the Group and Company balance sheets.
The effect for 2003 is to decrease shareholders funds and investments at 31 December 2003 by 1,903,000 in both the Group and Company balance sheets.
Own shares held Offset in the profit and loss reserve is an amount of 7,569,000 representing the cost of own shares held.
This balance consists of own shares held by the Groups ESOP and QUEST.
The trust was set up in 1998 and purchased shares at the time of the Companys flotation using funds provided by the Company.
Conditional awards under the Groups LTIP have been granted over these shares at 31 December 2003 but no awards have been made since the trust was created.
All costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the profit and loss account as they accrue and the trust has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.
Own shares held also include 6,131,000 2002: 16,596,000, being the cost of 721,080 shares, nominal value 361 2002: 1,796,754 shares, nominal value 898 held by the Groups QUEST, which was established by the Company during 1999 to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Group.
Of the 16,596,000 cost of shares held by the QUEST at 31 December 2002, 15,868,000 had originally been contributed by the Company by means of a gift and was written off against the profit and loss reserve in the years in which such contributions were made.
The gifted amounts therefore do not form part of the prior year adjustment of 728,000.
During the year, 1,075,674 shares 2002: 220,846 were allocated to satisfy employees and directors exercises under the Companys Save As You Earn scheme.
The trust has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares held by the QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the profit and loss account as they accrue.

Revaluation adjustments were made to: the value of tangible fixed assets to reflect the fair market value of the companys assets: the pension provision to increase the liability to 1,069,000 as the scheme had a deficit at the time of acquisition.
The scheme was valued on acquisition by qualified actuaries using the projected unit method: and to the deferred tax recognised to reflect the anticipated usage of the companys brought forward tax losses.
A fair value adjustment was made to deferred revenue to align the companys revenue recognition policy with that of the Group.
The companys loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2002 was 1.1 million and for the period from 1 January 2003 until acquisition was 1.3 million.
In April 2003, the Group acquired the minority interest, comprising 15% of issued share capital, of ARM Korea Limited, already a subsidiary undertaking, for cash consideration of 3,023,000.
No fair value adjustments were made and goodwill arising on this acquisition amounted to 2,077,000.
The acquisitions have been accounted for using acquisition accounting.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications Inc. filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomis US patent No.
ARM answered Nazomis complaint in July 2002, denying infringement of the 215 patent, asserting various affirmative defences and asserting counterclaims.
ARM moved for summary judgement and a ruling that the current version of its processor designs incorporating the Jazelle technology does not infringe the 215 patent.
The district court granted ARMs motion, holding that the current version of its processor designs incorporating the Jazelle technology does not infringe the 215 patent.
Nazomi has appealed the district courts ruling.
The appeal court has not set a date to hear the appeal yet.
ARM is confident that the original ruling by the district court will be upheld on appeal.
30 Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from disclosure available to parent companies under FRS 8, Related party disclosures, where transactions and balances between Group entities have been eliminated on consolidation.
During the year, the Group invested a further 1,152,000 in Superscape Group plc, a company in which Mike Inglis is a non-executive director.
Additionally, the Group purchased a licence for 500,000 from Superscape Group plc and made cross-licence payments of 453,000 to Superscape Group plc.
There were no other related party transactions during 2003 or 2002 which require disclosure.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 53 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 31 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP followed by the Group and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under UK GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
The principal differences between the Groups accounting policies under UK GAAP and those that would have been followed had the financial information been prepared under US GAAP are set out below.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from it.
This was also the Groups accounting policy under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, on which date, following the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen and became subject to annual impairment reviews.
No write-offs of goodwill arose as a result of the Groups impairment reviews.
Amortisation of intangibles Under UK GAAP, intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are included within the goodwill balance unless the asset can be identified and sold separately without disposing of the business as a whole.
Under US GAAP, such intangible assets may meet the criteria set out in SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, for categorisation as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives.
Under US GAAP, payments made to purchase intangible assets that are still in development are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Thus differences arise in the amounts of goodwill recognised and the associated amortisation charge.
Marketable securities Under US GAAP, investments in available-for-sale securities are marked to market where the market value is readily determinable and gains and losses, net of deferred taxation, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Where an impairment is considered to be other than temporary, the security is written down through the profit and loss account to a new cost basis represented by the fair value of the security on the date the impairment was determined.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups accounting policy is to carry such investments at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under UK GAAP, the fair value of the shares awarded under the LTIP is charged to compensation cost over the period in respect of which performance conditions apply.
To the extent the award is adjusted by virtue of performance conditions being met or not, the compensation cost is adjusted in line with this.
Under US GAAP, the Group follows variable plan accounting for these grants, measuring compensation expense as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at each period end over the vesting period of the options.
Increases in fair market value of the shares result in a charge and decreases in fair market value of the shares result in a credit, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed.
Save As You Earn SAYE plans Under UK GAAP, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption provided by UITF 17, Employee share schemes, not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of options granted under SAYE plans.
Under US GAAP, the Group follows the requirements of EITF 00-23, which does not permit such an exemption in respect of plans where the savings period is in excess of 27 months, as is the case with the Groups Inland Revenue approved UK SAYE plans.
EITF 00-23 applies only to new offers made since 24 January 2002.
The compensation charge made under US GAAP is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straightline basis over the savings period.
In addition, certain options attract a charge under variable plan accounting under US GAAP.
Employer taxes on share options Under UK GAAP, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting period of the options.
Under US GAAP such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.
Tax on UK and US share options In the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as compensation under US tax rules for certain employee share options, which have been exercised during the year.
Similarly, in the UK, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the profit made by employees on certain options that have been exercised during the year.
In both cases, the amount is equivalent to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise.
Under UK GAAP the tax benefit arising from this deduction is included in the tax charge in the profit and loss account whilst under US GAAP, the tax benefit is recorded as an increase in shareholders funds.
Embedded derivatives Under US GAAP, where the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer and where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, such derivatives are carried at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives are not revalued to fair value under UK GAAP.
Cash Under UK GAAP, cash does not include short-term deposits and investments which cannot be withdrawn without notice and without incurring a penalty.
Such items are shown as short-term investments.
Under US GAAP, deposits with a maturity of less than three months at inception which are convertible into known amounts of cash are included as cash and cash equivalents.
Deposits with a maturity at inception of between three months and one year are shown as short-term investments.
Consolidated profit and loss account Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on disposal of fixed asset trade investments are shown after operating profit.
Under US GAAP, gains and losses are reported in income from operations.
Under UK GAAP, profit before tax is stated before minority interests.
Under US GAAP, income before income tax is stated after minority interests.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
54 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 31 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP followed by the Group and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP continued Under UK GAAP cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, management of liquid resources and financing activities.
US GAAP, however, requires only three categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance shown under UK GAAP are included as operating activities under US GAAP.
Dividends payable Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the period end are recorded in the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, they are recorded in the period in which they are declared.

The matters addressed in this operating and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs high-performance, low-cost, power-efficient reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors and related technology and software, and licenses this IP to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard products ASSPs based on the ARM architecture to systems companies.
ARM also licenses and sells development systems directly to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other system designers.
ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual property-centred and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Market conditions The challenging economic environment in the semiconductor industry experienced in recent years persisted throughout 2003 and the industry remained competitive.
Despite this, the outlook from our partners has developed a more positive tone supported by increased product shipments resulting in increased royalty income for the Company.
Both our royalty revenues and units have increased significantly compared with 2002 and quarter on quarter throughout 2003.
Partners have remained cautious, though, in licensing new technology and this has had a direct impact on our licensing activity.
The decision in 2002 to adjust our cost base in line with our expectations of shortto medium-term revenue growth has ensured that the Company has remained profitable through 2003, with operating margins also increasing quarter on quarter excluding one-off legal settlement costs.
Despite this decision, we have continued to invest heavily in research and development which has resulted in a variety of new products being released during 2003, including the ARM1156 and ARM1176 cores, as well as new features and enhanced functionality with the TrustZone security extension and Thumb-2 core technology.
As well as remaining profitable, the Company has been robustly cash generative, with net cash inflows from operating activity of 38.7 million, giving rise to a year-end cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of 159.8 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Year ended 31 December 2001 2002 2003 %% % Revenues: Product revenues 87.5 88.1 88.2 Service revenues 12.5 11.9 11.8 Total revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Product costs 5.6 4.3 4.8 Service costs 6.2 4.4 3.8 Total cost of revenues 11.8 8.7 8.6 Gross profit 88.2 91.3 91.4 Operating expenses: Research and development 25.3 31.3 37.6 Sales and marketing 14.7 16.4 17.9 General and administrative 15.4 14.9 22.4 Restructuring costs 1.3 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 Total operating expenses 56.7 63.9 77.9 Income from operations 31.5 27.4 13.5 Interest, net 3.1 2.9 3.7 Minority interest 0.2 0.2 0.1 Income before income tax 34.4 30.1 17.1 Provision for income taxes 11.1 9.1 7.0 Net income 23.3 21.0 10.1 Total revenues Total revenues were 128.1 million in 2003, a decrease of 15% from 150.9 million in 2002, which was a 3% increase from 146.3 million in 2001.
The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2003 was $1.64 compared with the effective average rate for ARM of $1.61 compared with 1.50 in 2002.
This had the effect of reducing total reported revenues by approximately 9.6 million.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 57 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties.
Product revenues for 2001, 2002 and 2003 were 128.0 million, 132.9 million and 113.0 million, representing 87%, 88% and 88% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues increased from 76.8 million in 2001 to 83.0 million in 2002 and decreased to 50.8 million in 2003 representing approximately 52%, 55% and 40% of total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
The continuing importance of the ARM7 family was evident in 2003, accounting for 18% of licensing revenues in 2003, compared with 15% in 2002 and 20% in 2001.
This proportion reflected the increasing volume of per-use licenses signed within the Foundry Programme.
Revenues from the ARM9 family have declined, accounting for 44% of revenues in 2001, 43% in 2002 and 31% in 2003, partly due to more per-use licenses being taken than full implementation licenses, and partly due to the growing range of other cores available to license from the Company.
These include a broadening number of ARM9, ARM10 and ARM11 core family products including the ARM926 in the Foundry Programme, the ARM 968, ARM1156 and ARM1176, the first core in the next-generation family of ARM products and architectural licenses which give licensees more rights to modify the technology, peripheral technology, models, sub-systems and application software.
51 new licenses were signed in 2003, as well as 26 new licensees bringing the total number of semiconductor partners to 128 at the end of 2003.
Of the 51 new licenses, 26 were per-use licenses within the Foundry Programme, introduced in 2000 to enable small fabless chip companies to gain access to the Companys technology at a lower price point.
Sales of licenses to the existing customer base of semiconductor partners has become a more important part of the business, accounting for more than 90% of total license fees in 2003: this compares with approximately 89% in 2002 and 80% in 2001.
These existing partners take licenses to new core families not previously licensed or derivatives of cores already licensed.
The sale of non-core licenses, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, models, and sub-systems, decreased in 2003 to 8.9 million from 12.6 million in 2002 and 11.9 million in 2001 representing approximately 18% of license revenues in 2003, 15% in 2002 and 15% in 2001.
Revenues from the sale of Development Systems decreased from 23.3 million in 2001 to 23.1 million in 2002 to 17.9 million in 2003 representing approximately 16%, 15% and 14% of total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
The majority of ARMs sales of Development Systems are in US dollars and the US dollar value of sales of Development Systems in 2003 was approximately 16% lower than in 2002.
Sales of Development Systems have continued to be affected by increased competition in the debug tools marketplace.
To assist in the future development of our Development Systems business, we have put in place a new management team and increased resource within this group to progress the products, upgrades and releases available.
The first indicators of these actions have shown through in the latter stages of the year and will continue further into 2004.
Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensees net sales price per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales.
In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data is received and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the current year.
Royalties decreased from 27.9 million in 2001 to 26.8 million in 2002, and increased to 44.3 million in 2003, representing 19%, 18% and 34% of total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
Volume shipments increased from 420 million units in 2001 to 456 million units in 2002, mainly due to increased production of a wide range of electronic devices, including wireless handsets, secure products and automotive products.
Unit shipments in 2003 were 782 million, with the increase in volumes coming from all market segments.
We have seen the Company becoming less reliant on the wireless sector where, although actual unit shipments have significantly increased in 2003, their contribution has consistently fallen below 70% of total reported units.
The consumer entertainment and storage market segments have shown the largest relative growth in the year.
The Company expects the trend of increasing proportions of unit shipments into the non-wireless markets to continue into 2004.
The Company expects royalty revenues to grow year on year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training.
Service revenues decreased from 18.3 million in 2001 to 18.0 million in 2002 to 15.1 million in 2003, representing 13%, 12% and 12% of total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
Consulting revenues decreased from 7.4 million in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and 2.4 million in 2003, as engineering resource was directed away from consulting projects to research and development activities.
Revenues from support, maintenance and training increased from 10.9 million in 2001 to 13.6 million in 2002 and decreased to 12.7 million in 2003.
Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Companys revenues fluctuate from period to period depending upon the country of origin of its customers.
The pattern of revenues in 2003 was 51% of revenues coming from the US, 19% from Japan, 12% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 18% from Europe.
In 2002, revenues from the US represented 44%, Japan 25%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 13%, and Europe 18%.
In 2001, 49% of revenues came from the US, 23% from Japan, 9% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 19% from Europe.
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of Development Systems, amortization of our thirdparty technology licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners.
Product costs were 8.2 million in 2001, 6.5 million in 2002 and 6.2 million in 2003 representing 6%, 4% and 5% of total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
Approximately two-thirds of total product cost of sales were made up of Development Systems costs in 2003, with the balance comprising additional costs related to the costs of third-party licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners.
This compares to approximately four-fifths of total product cost of sales being made up of Development Systems costs in 2001 and two-thirds in 2002, with the balance being costs associated with third-party licenses.
Product gross margin in 2003 was 95%, compared to 95% in 2002 and 94% in 2001.
The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in product costs in 2004, although this would be subject to significant fluctuations if management were obliged to port further operating systems to run on the ARM architecture.
Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to consulting work performed for third parties.
Cost of services decreased from approximately 9.1 million in 2001 to 6.7 million in 2002 to 4.9 million in 2003.
The gross margins earned on service revenues were approximately 50% in 2001, 63% in 2002 and 68% in 2003.
In 2003, the Company elected to allocate more engineering resource to research and development activities, thus enabling the Company to develop more innovative products and technologies during the year.
58 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from 36.9 million in 2001 to 47.3 million in 2002 and 48.1 million in 2003, representing 25%, 31% and 38% of total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
Continued investment in research and development remains an essential part of the Companys strategy since the development of new products to license is key to its ongoing success.
Key areas of product development for 2004 include the development of further power-saving technologies OptimoDE and central processing unit CPU cores based on symmetric multiprocessor technology, improved security through the TrustZone and SecurJC technologies and developments in superscalar CPU architectures.
Total engineering headcount decreased from 429 at the end of 2001 to 420 at the end of 2002, and was 442 at the end of 2003.
The increase in 2003 was predominantly due to the acquisition of ARM Belgium N. V. Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure increased from 21.5 million in 2001 to 24.7 million in 2002 and was 23.0 million in 2003, representing 15% of total revenues in 2001, 16% in 2002, and 18% in 2003.
Headcount in this area increased from 198 at 31 December 2001 to 208 at 31 December 2002, and decreased to 203 at 31 December 2003.
The total number of offices with sales people is currently 14 and this enables improved contact with the Companys geographically diverse customer base.
In 2001, a further sales office was opened in the US and in 2002 a sales office was opened in Shanghai, PR China.
Additional sales offices are expected to be opened in India and PR China during 2004.
General and administrative General and administrative headcount decreased from 95 at 31 December 2001 to 93 at 31 December 2002, and was 95 at 31 December 2003.
General and administrative costs were 22.5 million in both 2001 and 2002 and increased to 28.7 million in 2003, representing 15%, 15% and 22% of total revenues respectively.
Costs in 2003 include 1.6 million of impairments made to investments 2002: 0.8 million: 2001: 0.6 million.
Legal costs fluctuated from 5.5 million in 2001 to 2.5 million in 2002 and 9.1 million in 2003 largely as a result of annual variations in the amount of legal expenses relating to patent protection cases and other similar costs.
The primary reason for the increase in legal costs from 2002 to 2003 was the provision for settlement of the Herodion arbitration.
Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts was 1.4 million in 2002, compared with 0.7 million in 2001 and a net release of 1.1 million in 2003.
Unrealized future foreign exchange losses on certain committed but not yet invoiced future revenue streams of 1.1 million 2002: 1.0 million: 2001: nil were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133.
There was a loss on foreign exchange of 0.2 million in 2001, an exchange gain of 0.5 million in 2002 and an exchange gain of 0.9 million in 2003.
See Foreign Currency Fluctuations below.
Restructuring costs During 2002, the Company incurred restructuring costs of 2.0 million comprising mainly severance payments, substantially all of which were paid during the fourth quarter of 2002 following a reduction in total headcount of 98 people representing 12% of the Companys workforce.
Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets The Company purchased the assets of Infinite Designs Limited in March 2000, EuroMIPS Systems SAS in June 2000 and Allant Software Corporation in September 2000.
In 2001, the Company purchased the assets of Noral Micrologics Limited, a ten-person company with expertise in debugging software, for a consideration of 1.4 million.
Amortization of goodwill of 1.9 million was charged to the income statement in 2001.
There was no charge for goodwill in 2002 or 2003 following the Companys adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets.
During 2000 a license connected with the rights to use a certain debugging technology for use in the Companys development systems products was purchased for 2.8 million.
This is being amortized over a period of three years with 0.7 million 2002: 0.9 million, 2001: 0.9 million amortized during 2003.
The Company also purchased a new license for 1.1 million in 2001 to enable the Company to produce and license Java technology-related products.
This is being amortized over a period of five years with 0.2 million amortized during 2001, 0.2 million amortized during 2002 and a further 0.2 million amortized during 2003.
A further license was purchased in 2002 for 0.2 million.
This is being amortized over three years with 0.1 million amortized during 2003.
An additional two licenses were purchased in 2003 totalling 0.7 million and these are being amortized over three years with 0.2 million being amortized in the year.
Following the out-of-court settlement of the Companys litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights to the Company for a payment of 7.5 million.
This is being amortized over four years and 1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002 and 2.0 million in 2003.
The Company also purchased a patent for 0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years.
The amortization charge for 2002 was 0.1 million and for 2003 was 0.1 million.
The adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, has not resulted in any impairment of the Companys goodwill or intangible assets.
Interest Interest receivable fell from 4.5 million in 2001 to 4.4 million in 2002 and increased to 4.8 million in 2003.
The growth in interest earned between 2002 and 2003 was due to higher average cash balances, and interest earned fell slightly between 2001 and 2002 reflecting the drop in market interest rates during 2001 and 2002.
The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to six months during 2003.
Income before income tax Income before income tax was 50.3 million in 2001, 45.4 million in 2002 and 22.0 million in 2003, representing 34%, 30% and 17% of total revenues respectively.
The drop in margins in 2002 was a result of lower than anticipated revenues in the second half of the year, whilst the drop in margin in 2003 was due to lower revenues and higher legal costs including one-off settlement costs not being entirely offset by reduced other operating expenses.
Tax charge The Companys effective tax rates were 32.4% in 2001, 30.3% in 2002 and 40.7% in 2003.
The effective tax rate fell in 2002 as a result of the Companys ability to claim research and development tax credits for most of the year, but increased in 2003 due to the impact of certain cash and non-cash accounting charges not being deductible for tax purposes.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 59 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Liquidity and capital resources The Companys operating activities provided net cash of 52.0 million, 39.5 million and 38.7 million in 2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively.
In 2001 the significant items impacting on cash generated from operations were the increase in accounts receivable of 6.6 million and the increase in deferred revenue of 6.7 million.
In 2002, accounts receivable decreased 2.9 million while deferred revenues fell by 5.0 million and in 2003 accounts receivable decreased by a further 4.5 million and deferred revenues fell by 3.4 million.
Accounts payable in 2003 fell by 2.5 million compared with increases in 2002 and 2001 of 2.4 million and 0.3 million respectively.
In 2003 prepaid expenses decreased by 2.8 million, compared with an increase of 5.3 million and 1.4 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively.
The Company entered into several leases for design automation tools during 2002, which resulted in the large increase in prepaid expenses, but fell in 2003 as a result of the lease payments being for shorter prepaid periods than in previous years.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2003, the Company recorded approximately 11.1 million in deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be recognized as revenues in varying amounts after 31 December 2003.
At 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001, the Company recorded approximately 14.4 million and 19.4 million respectively in deferred revenues.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure in 2003 was 3.6 million, compared with 15.6 million in 2002 and 17.3 million in 2001.
Expenditure in 2001 was high due to the need to invest in new design automation tools for a rapidly expanding workforce and the costs of establishing and improving the Companys design centers in the UK, France and the US.
In 2002, capital expenditure decreased as a result of the Company leasing some of the design automation tools that would have previously been purchased.
Capital expenditure in 2003 was much lower as a result of the increased leasing of the design automation tools and the much lower level of recruitment.
In 2001, 4.0 million was spent on office improvements with 13.4 million spent on computer equipment and software.
In 2002, 8.2 million was spent on computer equipment and software and 7.4 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
In 2003, 1.8 million was spent on computer equipment and software and 1.8 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
In 2001, the Company purchased part of the business of Noral Micrologics Limited for 1.4 million in cash.
In 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority interest in ARM Korea Limited for cash consideration of 3.0 million bringing its holding to 100%.
The Company also acquired the entire share capital of Adelante Technologies N. V. now renamed ARM Belgium N. V. for total consideration of 0.4 million.
The Company envisages making strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can broaden its product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved significantly.
In 2001, the Company made the following investments in available-for-sale securities: 0.3 million in LinkUp Systems, Inc. and 1.0 million in Pixim, Inc.
In addition, in 2001 the Company sold its investment in Parthus for a profit of 0.1 million, and its investment in Sirius Communications N. V. for a profit of 0.5 million.
It recognized a loss on its investment in LinkUp Systems of 0.3 million at the end of 2001 when LinkUps entire business was purchased by a third party.
In 2002, the Company made one investment in an available-for-sale security, namely Superscape Group plc, for a consideration of 1.5 million.
In 2003 the Company invested a further 1.2 million in Superscape Group plc as part of a further funding round, thus maintaining its 12% holding.
Cash and short-term investment balances at 31 December 2003 were 159.8 million compared to 130.3 million at 31 December 2002.
At 31 December 2002, accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful debts were 20.5 million and 17.3 million at 31 December 2003, which represented 14% and 14% of revenues respectively.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Companys earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Companys revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are in sterling.
The Company reduces this US dollar sterling risk where possible by currency hedging.
Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual licenses and the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a  basis.
It then hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks.
The average size of each forward contract was $3.0 million in 2001, $7.2 million in 2002, and $4.6 million in 2003.
The Company does not currently use any other financial instruments or derivatives, although the Company is reviewing the use of other financial instruments such as currency options.
The fair values of the financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2001, 2002 and 2003 are disclosed in footnote 13 to the financial statements.
The settlement period of the forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2003 is between 12 January 2004 and 26 March 2004.
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
The Company believes that its future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors.
These include the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Companys semiconductor partners and sudden technological change in the microprocessor industry.
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees, management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions.
Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Companys annual report on Form 20-F for 2003.
All activities relate to continuing operations.

64 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Company design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard processors ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilize the Companys technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Company also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Companys principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
The Company was formed on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer UK Limited, and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc.
Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.
Group undertakings include ARM Limited incorporated in the UK, ARM, INC. incorporated in the US, ARM KK incorporated in Japan, ARM Korea Limited incorporated in South Korea, ARM France SAS incorporated in France, ARM Belgium N. V. formerly Adelante Technologies N. V. incorporated in Belgium and acquired and renamed during 2003, Allant Software Corporation incorporated in the US, Advanced RISC Machines Limited incorporated in the UK, Micrologic Solutions Limited incorporated in the UK, ARM Taiwan Limited incorporated in Taiwan and ARM Consulting Shanghai Co. Limited incorporated in PR China.
Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in UK sterling.
Purely for the convenience of the reader, the 31 December 2003 consolidated financial statements have been translated from sterling at the closing rate on 31 December 2003 of 1.00 $1.79.
Such translations should not be construed as representations that the sterling amounts represent, or have been or could be so converted into US dollars at that rate or at any other rate.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
115, Accounting for certain investments in debt and securities, and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value: at 31 December 2003 and 2002, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management.
Two trade investments were made in 2001, one of which was a 1.7% investment in Pixim, Inc. and the other was a 1.3% investment in LinkUp Systems, Inc.
Both of these are fabless chip companies based in California.
Equity shares in both companies were received in settlement of accounts receivable.
The Company sold its 3% stake in Sirius Communications N. V. during 2001.
During 2002, the Company made a 12% investment in Superscape Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company made an additional investment in Superscape Group plc during 2003 maintaining its percentage shareholding.
Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them.
An independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, and such assets are capitalized and amortized over a period of two to five years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them, with the exception of in-process research and development which is written off immediately.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from it.
Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on 1 January 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill.
The value of goodwill carried forward at the end of 2001 has been frozen at 2,274,000 and goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually.
An annual impairment review in 2003 determined, by way of a comparison of the Companys market capitalization to shareholders equity, that there was no indication of impairment with respect to goodwill.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 65 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Impairment charges The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would be recognized, and the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the Companys intellectual property IP, which is customized to each customers manufacturing process.
The Company receives royalties on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and consultancy services.
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, ASICs and ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
The Companys IP consists of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software.
Most licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application.
In general, the time between the signing of a license and final customer acceptance is between six and 15 months.
Upgrades or modifications to the licensed IP are not provided.
Following customer acceptance, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
Revenue from per-use licenses is recognized when the product is accepted by the customer.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts, when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, contract accounting is applied.
Revenues from license fees are recognized based on the  method over the period from signing of the license to customer acceptance and the completion of all outstanding obligations.
The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement and the  achieved.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Revenues are recognized only when collectability is probable.
Estimates of total project requirement are based on prior experience of customization, delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
In accordance with SOP 97-2, Software revenue recognition, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require significant production, modification or customization, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual elements based on each elements relative fair value.
Revenue for each element is then recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element is met.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Company and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licenses to the product.
In those cases where the Company makes sales of these products, the total value of the license is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Company records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the license fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-contract support support and maintenance PCS which consists of an identified customer contact at the Company, and telephone or e-mail support.
Revenue related to PCS is recognized based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE, determined based on the price of PCS when sold separately.
Revenue for PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Company with the licensee.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery.
Where necessary, and in the circumstances permitted by SOP 97-2, the costs associated with providing post contract support have been accrued.
Services, such as consulting and training, which are not essential to the functionality of the IP, are accounted for separately based on VSOE.
Revenue is recognized as services are performed and collectability is probable.
The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognized when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, is recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For longer-term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenue is recognized on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
This method approximates to percentage to completion based on labor inputs.
66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Costs include salaries, relevant EDA tools costs and other directly related expenditure as well as a proportion of central facilities costs.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European Union.
The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements.
Grants received are intended to cover 50% of expected project costs.
Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred.
Unconditional undertakings have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received.
Amounts receivable under these arrangements in the year ended 31 December 2003 were 226,000 2002: 199,000: 2001: 268,000 and were netted against related research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended 31 December 2001, 2002 and 2003 were 1,591,000, 1,894,000, and 1,848,000 respectively.
Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be short-term investments.
Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Currency translation The functional currency for the Companys operations is the local currency in which it operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
Translation differences are taken to the cumulative translation adjustment.
The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Companys forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
Because the Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the income statement.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Company nor the functional currency of the customer.
In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement under general and administrative costs.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 67 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2003 excludes incremental shares of approximately 18,948,000 2002: 19,608,000: 2001: 6,258,000 related to employee stock options.
These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
The ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee stock-based compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations.
Stock-based employee compensation cost in respect of certain SAYE options see below of 310,000 and in respect of the LTIP of 241,000 is reflected in net income.
No compensation cost is recorded in respect of the other stock option plans, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Apart from certain options issued to executive directors, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options.
For executive directors, discretionary share options of up to two times base salary may be issued each year that will vest after seven years.
If, however, the Company achieves defined levels of EPS growth above the rate of inflation over a period of three years, then the options are exercisable after three years.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No.

The Company operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under these schemes are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the savings period must be at least 36 months.
During 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus, contained within EITF 00-23, that savings plans which have a savings period in excess of 27 months should be treated as compensatory.
In accordance with EITF 00-23, which applies to new offers after 24 January 2002, the Company has recognized a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans offered since that date.
The compensation charge is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
In addition, the EITF reached a consensus that an employers offer to enter into a new SAYE contract at a lower price than an existing contract causes variable accounting for all existing awards subject to the offer.
Variable accounting commences for all existing awards when the offer is made, and for those awards that are retained by employees because the offer is declined, variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, or expire unexercised.
New awards are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are canceled.
The compensation charge recorded in 2003 as a result of these provisions is 109,000 2002: nil.
The number of options to which variable accounting applies is approximately 950,000 2002: 980,000.
The Company has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognize a compensation charge under the EITF, calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the period end, over the vesting period of the options.
During 2003, a charge of 241,000 was incurred and deferred compensation at 31 December 2003 was 1,418,000 68 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Employee share ownership plans Treasury stock represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust ESOP and the QUEST.
The ESOP was set up on 16 April 1998 to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees.
Under the groups Long Term Incentive Plan, 2,572,646 shares could be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP.
The market value of unearned shares at 31 December 2003 was 6,425,000.
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.
For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they vest unconditionally.
Treasury stock held also includes 6,131,000 relating to 721,080 shares held by the Companys QUEST, which was established by the Company during 1999.
The Company established the QUEST to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
No shares were purchased in 2003, 2002 or 2001.
The shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares.
They will be allocated to employees and directors to satisfy their options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes.
During 2003, 1,075,674 shares 2002: 220,846 were allocated from the QUEST following the exercise of share options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes.
Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the income statement as they accrue.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions.
In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employers taxes on these share options.
These amounts will be recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of variable interest entities.
FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No 51, Consolidated financial statements, to certain entities in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after 31 January 2003 and as of 1 January 2004 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before 1 February 2003.
FIN 46 applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period.
Management does not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150 SFAS 150, Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
The statement addresses the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity and requires that these instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position.
This statement is effective prospectively for financial instruments entered into or modified after 31 May 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after 15 June 2003.
This statement shall be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption.
The adoption of SFAS 150 has not, to date, had any significant impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.
Companies Act 1985 These financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 of Great Britain the Companies Act.
The Companys statutory accounts, which are its primary financial statements, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP in compliance with the Companies Act and are presented in pounds sterling.
Statutory accounts upon which the auditors gave unqualified reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act and which did not contain statements under sub-sections 237 2 and 3 of the Companies Act for the years ended 31 December 2001 and 2002 have been, and those for the year ended 31 December 2003 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
Dividends are required to be declared in sterling out of profits available for that purpose as determined in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.
2 Related party transactions During the year, the Company invested a further 1,152,000 in Superscape Group plc, a company in which Mike Inglis is a non-executive director.
Additionally, the Company purchased a license for 500,000 from Superscape Group plc and made cross-license payments of 453,000 to Superscape Group plc.

Such benefits are reflected as additional paid-in capital.
Total income tax expense differs from the amounts computed by applying the UK statutory income tax rate of 30% for 2003, 2002 and 2001 to income before income tax as a result of the following: Year ended 31 December 2001 2002 2003 000 000 000 UK statutory rate 30% 2002: 30%: 2001: 30% 15,091 13,627 6,588 Permanent differences other 1,150 186 1,803 Differences in statutory rates of foreign countries 99 115 92 Other, net 38 143 460 16,302 13,785 8,943 Permanent differences comprise permanent adjustments and the UK research and development tax credit.

If these earnings were to be remitted without offsetting tax credits in the UK, withholding taxes would be approximately 347,000 2002: 518,000: 2001: 385,000.
The valuation allowance relates to net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believes it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized.
None of the loss carryforwards expires before 2018.
The future use of the net operating losses carried forward in ARM Inc. may be restricted in the event of a purchase by a third party, whereby the level of losses to be utilized on an annual basis would be limited to 4% of the market value of ARM Inc. at the date of the transaction.

Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the Companys customers are large, well-established companies.
The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
For further information see footnote 12.
At 31 December 2001, 2002 and 2003, no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
As of 31 December 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK in the form of money market deposits for varying periods of up to six months.
6 Acquisitions In July 2003, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Adelante Technologies N. V. now ARM Belgium N. V., a Belgian company, for total consideration of 390,000, comprising 312,000 cash consideration and 78,000 of related acquisition expenses.
ARM Belgium N. V. is a developer of data engine processors for data intensive tasks, and will enable ARM to provide innovative IP solutions to meet the growing challenges of our partners.
The following table sets out the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: Fair value to Company 000 Cash and cash equivalents 23 Accounts receivable 647 Total current assets 670 Deferred income taxes 640 Property and equipment, net 311 Intangible assets 302 Goodwill 1 Total assets acquired 1,924 Current liabilities: Accounts payable 135 Accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 330 Pension provision 1,069 Total liabilities assumed 1,534 Net assets acquired 390 Of the 302,000 of acquired intangible assets, 167,000 was assigned to developed technology that is being amortized over five years and 135,000 to customer relationships that is being amortized over two years.
In April 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority holding in ARM Korea Limited, already a subsidiary undertaking net assets acquired of 946,000, for cash consideration of 3,023,000, bringing the Companys holding to 100%.
Goodwill resulting from this acquisition amounted to 2,077,000.
There were no separately identifiable intangible assets.
On 1 February 2001, the Company purchased part of the business and assets of Noral Micrologics Limited for cash consideration of 1,351,000.
The purchase consideration has all been treated as goodwill, as the book and fair value of the assets acquired were negligible.
Further to this cash consideration, the acquisition agreement provided for cash bonuses and payments for post-acquisition pre-defined services provided by employees.
These are being treated as payroll costs of the periods to which the services relate.
The combinations have been accounted for using the purchase method.
72 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 7 Investments In 2002, the Company invested 1,500,000 in Superscape Group plc, an available-for-sale investment.

In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years.
The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over four to five years, developed technology the main IP of the company existent at acquisition and generating revenue over five years and customer relationships relationships with customers which were generating revenue at acquisition over two years, being the periods over which the Company is expected to derive benefit from them.
The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets in each of the next five years is set forth below: 000 2004 2,700 2005 2,652 2006 266 2007 79 2008 19 ARM Annual report and accounts 2003 73 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 10 Shareholders equity Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to directors and employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Share Option Plan, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
There are two further schemes for our French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM, Inc. where the period is two years.
The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM, Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The Company set up two further savings-related option schemes in each of 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.

Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party.
Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes such third party's intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
