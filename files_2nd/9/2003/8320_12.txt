Statement of Directors responsibilities In respect of the preparation of the financial statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the statement of auditors responsibilities included in their report below, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and auditors in relation to the financial statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Independent auditors report To the members of International Power plc We have audited the financial statements on pages 62 to 91.
We have also audited the information in the Directors remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors remuneration report.
As described above, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the UK by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and by our professions ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on page 33 reflects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the Directors remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2003 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended: the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The ESPS is divided into sections, and the International Power Group of ESPS was opened to members on 1 April 2002 and employees past service rights were transferred into the Group later that year.
For 2002 SSAP 24 disclosures, the pension expense was taken to be equal to the total contributions paid, as assets and liabilities in respect of members pensionable service prior to 1 April 2002 were not transferred to the Group until late 2002.
Pension costs for 2003 have been calculated using assumptions consistent with those used to assess the initial rate of contributions paid by the Group, and based on market conditions at the start of the accounting period.
The pension cost for 2003 is 3.1 million, comprising 2.6 million regular cost and 0.5 million variation cost.
The principal assumptions used to calculate these pension costs are set out below: Pre-retirement investment return 6.5% pa Post-retirement investment return 5.0% pa Salary increases 3.8% pa Pension increases in deferment 2.5% pa Pension increases in payment 2.5% pa The actuarial value of assets as at 31 March 2003, the date of the first formal actuarial valuation, was 33 million.
The accrued liabilities valued on the projected unit method using assumptions set out below, were 43 million.
The market value of assets was, therefore, 77% of accrued liabilities.
Arrangements have been made to make good the past service deficit over the average future working lifetime of the membership calculated to be approximately 12 years.

72 International Power FRS17 In accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the schemes and the fair value of assets held.
However, as permitted by FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the financial statements continue to be reported under the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures for the UK schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 30 November 2001, 31 March 2002 and 31 March 2003, and updated by qualified independent actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2003.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for employees of its overseas businesses.
Full actuarial valuations of these schemes have been carried out within the last three years and results have been updated to 31 December 2003 by qualified independent actuaries.

A net loss per share would only be increased by the exercise of out-of-the money share options.
Since it seems inappropriate to assume that option holders would act irrationally, no adjustment has been made for out-of-the-money options and hence diluted EPS after exceptional items equals basic EPS after exceptional items.

Financial instruments comprise net debt see note 26 together with other instruments deemed to be financial instruments including long-term debtors, creditors and provisions for liabilities and charges.
a Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures other than the currency risk disclosures as relevant.
The fair value of short-term debtors and creditors approximates to the carrying value because of their short maturity.
In accordance with FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments, deferred tax has been excluded from the following disclosures.
b Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2003 was: 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Currency m m m m m m Sterling 91 7 84 171 59 112 US dollar 767 128 639 971 194 777 Australian dollar 554 117 437 487 110 377 Czech koruna 46 9 37 51 34 17 Others 15 15 17 1 16 Total 1,473 261 1,212 1,697 398 1,299 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of financial liabilities.
There are no material financial liabilities on which interest is not paid.
The effect of the Group interest swaps was to classify 437 million of floating rate Australian dollar borrowings as fixed rate, 438 million of floating rate US dollar borrowings as fixed rate, 84 million of floating rate sterling borrowings as fixed rate and 37 million of floating rate Czech koruna borrowings as fixed rate, in the above table.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance for various time periods up to 12 months by reference to LIBOR for that time period.
The figures in the following tables take into account interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial liabilities and financial assets.

All investments are in publicly quoted stocks or treasury instruments.
Letters of credit totalling 132 million are supported on a cash collateral basis at 31 December 2003. d Currency exposures As explained on page 17 of the Operating and financial review, the Groups objective in managing the currency exposures arising during the normal course of business in other words, its structural currency exposures is to fully hedge all known contractual currency exposures, where possible.
As at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002, these exposures were not considered to be material.
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
It is not Group policy to hedge currency translation through forward contracts or currency swaps.
e Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors and accruals, was as follows: 31 December 31 December 2003 2002 m m In one year or less, or on demand 531 1,078 In more than one year but not more than two years 97 39 In more than two years but not more than five years 249 128 In more than five years 596 452 Total 1,473 1,697 As discussed in note 18, the Group is in discussions with bank groups in relation to claimed technical defaults on the non-recourse debt for the US merchant asset portfolio.
Until these issues are resolved and documented, the debt at ANP is reported as current non-recourse debt in our accounts.

ii The fair value of investments maturing after three months has been estimated using quoted market prices.
iii The fair value of long-term borrowings and interest rate swaps has been calculated using market prices when available or the net present value of future cash flows arising.
iv The fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options has been calculated using the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.
v The fair value of energy derivatives is measured using market based methodologies that provide a consistent measure across diverse energy products.
Within the above fair values, only the financial assets and liabilities have been marked-to-market as defined by the requirements of the accounting standard.
h Hedges As explained on page 17 of the Operating and financial review, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: i Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, options and forward rate agreements.
ii Structural and transactional currency exposures using currency borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts, currency options and swaps.
iii Currency exposures on future expected sales using currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, currency options and swaps.
iv Energy price fluctuations using physical hedges through the operation of energy supply and trading activities together with financial products.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised or expires.

The expiry of these contracts ranges from 2004 to 2021.
29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES a Legal proceedings against the Company The Company is aware of the following matters, which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group: i Claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the Central Electricity Generating Board CEGB, and contractors in respect of industrial illness and injury.
Innogy has agreed to indemnify International Power on an after-tax basis to the extent of 50% of any liability that the Company may incur whether directly or indirectly as a consequence of those proceedings to the extent such liability is not insured by Electra Insurance Limited.
ii In 1994 separate complaints were made by the National Association of Licensed Opencast Operators NALOO and the South Wales Small Miners Association SWSMA to the European Commission against the Company, PowerGen plc, British Coal Corporation and HM Government.
The complaint alleges violations of EU Competition law arising out of the coal purchasing arrangements entered into by the CEGB prior to 1 April 1990 and requests the Commission to find that the CEGBs practices violated EU law.
NALOO and SWSMA allege that such a finding would be grounds for a claim for damages in the English courts by members of NALOO.
An appeal against the Commission findings was brought by a faction of SWSMA, which was initially ruled out of time, but an appeal was reinstated.
Progress with this claim will be influenced by the outcome of the NALOO appeal.
The European Court has ruled that the Commission is under an obligation to investigate the complaint by NALOO.
The Company, PowerGen plc, British Coal Corporation and the Commission have appealed against the ruling to the European Court of Justice which delivered a judgement on 2 October 2003 for the main part dismissing the appeal.
The ruling confirmed that the Commission has the power to investigate and the matter is now with the Commission for consideration.
It is not practicable to estimate legal costs or possible damages at this stage.
The Commission ruled on the complaint in 1998 and did not make any findings against the Company.
Innogy has agreed to indemnify International Power on an after-tax basis to the extent of 50% of any liability that the Company may incur whether directly or indirectly as a consequence of those proceedings.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, the Groups insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that the matters referred to above will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Groups financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
b Taxation The Company is aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of disputes with the tax authorities in the territories where the Group has operations.
The principal exposures where significant amounts of tax could arise are in respect of potential exposures relating to the UK tax losses generated from the acquisition of Australian subsidiaries and related financing arrangements.
Discussions are continuing with the UK Inland Revenue to reach agreement on these issues.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to the professional advice received, that adequate provision has been made for the settlement of any taxation liabilities that might arise.
c Bonds and guarantees Various growth and expansion projects are supported by bonds, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Company totalling 424 million.
11 million of this is in respect of the loan facilities of its Elcogas investment which was provided for in the year ended 31 December 2001.
In February 2004, this guarantee and the Companys loan obligations have been cancelled following the disposal of the investment.
Energy trading activities relating to merchant plant are supported by letters of credit and guarantees totalling 110 million.
30 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Operations and maintenance contracts In the course of normal operations, the Group has contracted on an arms-length basis to provide power station operation and maintenance services to joint ventures and associated undertakings.
During the year the Group derived income of 37 million year ended 31 December 2002: 16 million from these arrangements.
Included in creditors is nil 2002: creditor 2 million in relation to these contracts.
31 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS In February 2004, the Group sold its investment in Elcogas, Spain.
This investment had been fully provided against and the release of a guarantee will result in an exceptional gain in the first quarter of 2004.
