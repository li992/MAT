c Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The majority of these schemes are self-administered and are separately funded.
The schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances, with the exception of those in Germany, which are financed mainly by internal provisions.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent,  actuaries.
The main schemes in the UK are of the defined benefit type and in Germany and the USA both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are operated.
The results of the most recent valuations or reviews of the main defined benefit schemes were as follows: 2003 2002 51511555551115 51115555551115 UK Germany USA UK Germany USA Date of last valuation review 31 Mar 2003 31 Dec 2003 30 Sep 2003 31 Mar 2001 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2002 Method used projected unit projected unit projected unit projected unit projected unit projected unit Market value of investments 454.8m 8.2m 13.1m 612.4m 15.0m 12.5m Assumed return on assets exceeds salary inflation by 3.1% 3.5% 1.13% 1.0%-1.75% 3.0% 4.5% Level of external funding 91.5% 8% 57% 108% 15% 54% Charge during year 15.6m 6.9m 1.7m 7.7m 7.2m 0.9m Total provision 26.4m 96.9m 1.9m 15.6m 94.8m 1.3m 555555555555551 111111111111 111111111111 111111111111 111111111111 111111111111 111111111111 UK: the two main defined benefit pension funds undertook full formal actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2003.
Both funds disclosed deficits as at the valuation date.
As a result, the employing companies are paying contributions at an increased rate in order to restore the funds to a full funding level.
The figures for the UK pension funds at the 31 March 2001 valuation have been restated to include the two RMC Pension Funds together with the two Rugby Pension Schemes subsequently transferred to the RMC Pension Fund.
The RMC Pension Fund was closed to new employees with effect from 1 January 2004.
Germany: the funding of the defined benefit schemes is met mainly by a book reserve.
The provision shown above relates to the book reserve held in the accounts of companies in the Readymix AG Group.
A proportion is provided through external insurance arrangements.
The value of investments and level of external funding shown above reflects these insurance arrangements.
The market value of the investments has reduced because the value of the insurance policy that relates to employees covered by a defined contribution benefit, which was included in the previous years has now been excluded.
The pension charges relating to other foreign schemes comply with the policy of providing for pensions on systematic and rational bases, so that the charges represent a consistent proportion of the related payroll costs.
d Post-retirement benefits The Group provides post-retirement healthcare, mainly in the UK and the USA to certain groups of its retired employees.
The Group conforms with the provisions of the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 6 Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits other than Pensions which require accrual of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benefits.
At 31 December 2003 the provision for both the UK and the USA totals 16.2 million 2002: 15.6 million, of which 8.6 million 2002: 8.1 million relates to the UK and 7.6 million 2002: 7.5 million relates to the USA.
Independent qualified actuaries have calculated these provisions.
The actuaries have assumed rates of inflation for medical expenses of 5.5% a year UK and 8% USA and discount rates of 6.6% a year UK and 6.63% USA.
RMC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 61 Notes to the accounts continued 9.
Employees and Directors continued e FRS 17 Retirement benefits The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosures with respect to the UK funds and the USA funds have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 31 March 2003 and 30 September 2003 respectively and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities at 31 December 2003.
In Germany the most recent actuarial review was completed at 31 December 2003.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value on 31 December 2003.
For all arrangements in each of the three countries the projected unit method of valuation was adopted.
The principal defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are in the UK, Germany and the USA.
These schemes cover over 95% of the Groups defined benefit pension liabilities.
The related deferred tax for Germany has been calculated on the difference between the deficit under FRS 17 and the book reserves held locally.
These book reserves are calculated in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary and are believed to be sufficient to meet the pension liabilities in this country.

Certain employees have agreed to transfer their benefits in the RMC funds to those of the purchaser under the terms of the sale agreement.
This has resulted in a settlement gain of 0.3 million.
Also in Great Britain, a number of redundancies took place towards the end of the year.
This has resulted in a net curtailment cost of 1.4 million.
As these items have been treated as non-operating and operating exceptional items respectively, they have not been included in the operating charge under FRS 17 in Note 9 e. In 2002 the Group disposed of an entity in Germany.
As this item was treated as a non-operating exceptional, it has not been included in the operating charge under FRS 17 in Note 9 e. The correction to plan assets in Germany arises because the value of the insurance policy that relates to employees covered by a defined contribution benefit, which was included in the previous year, has now been excluded.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Operating and financial review on pages 23 and 24 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
RMC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 77 Notes to the accounts continued 29.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS 13.
For this purpose non-equity interests are dealt with in the disclosures in the same way as the Groups financial liabilities, but separately disclosed.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are also excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS 13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures.
a Interest rate profile The Groups financial assets of 336.0 million 2002: 212.4 million comprise cash and short-term deposits of 161.7 million 2002: 129.0 million, other investments of 6.4 million 2002: 4.8 million, investments Australia of 92.5 million 2002: nil, loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings of 15.9 million 2002: 18.0 million see Note 13 and debtors due after more than one year of 59.5 million 2002: 60.6 million see Note 15.

78 RMC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 29.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued b Currency exposures As explained in the Operating and financial review on page 24, the Group considers a variety of issues including interest rate levels and tax in determining the appropriate level of borrowings in each currency which are used as a hedge against the currency translation exposures arising from its net investment overseas.
Gains and losses arising from these translation exposures are recognised in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses on page 50.
Because of the nature of its business, the Group experiences little currency exchange transaction exposure.
Such exposures would arise as a result of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency other than the operating currency of the relevant operating unit and any gains or losses would be recognised in the profit and loss account.
Because the Group considers its transaction exposures to be immaterial, no disclosure of such exposures is provided.
c Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2003 2002 11155555555 11155555555 Non-equity Non-equity interests Borrowings Total interests Borrowings Total m m m m m m In one year or less, or on demand 410.9 410.9 245.4 245.4 In more than one year but not more than two years 59.3 59.3 173.5 173.5 In more than two years but not more than five years 199.1 199.1 404.0 404.0 In more than five years 4.1 406.6 410.7 3.9 485.7 489.6 5555555555511111111551111111151 551 551 551 551 551 551 Total 4.1 1,075.9 1,080.0 3.9 1,308.6 1,312.5 5555555555511111111551111111151 551 551 551 551 551 551 5555555555511111111551111111151 551 551 551 551 551 551 d Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn, committed, borrowing facilities at 31 December as follows: 2003 2002 m m Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years 374.6 539.1 5555555555555555555555551555515111 551 551 Total 374.6 539.1 5555555555555555555555551555515111 551 551 5555555555555555555555551555515111 551 551 e Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December: 2003 2002 5511111551 5511111551 Book Fair Book Fair value value value value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term financial liabilities and current portion of long-term borrowings 410.9 410.9 245.4 245.4 Long-term borrowings 665.0 724.0 1,063.2 1,140.7 Cash and short-term deposits 161.7 161.7 129.0 129.0 Other investments 6.4 6.4 4.8 4.8 Investments Australia 145.2 145.2 Loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings 15.9 15.9 18.0 18.0 Debtors due after more than one year 59.5 59.5 60.6 60.6 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps 16.2 24.6 0.4 Cross currency swaps 41.1 32.1 19.7 11.0 Forward currency exchange contracts 4.4 3.9 5.1 5.5 555555555551111111155111115511111551111151111 551 551 551 551 The fair values of derivative financial instruments have been determined by reference to prices available in the market in which the derivative financial instruments are traded.
Fair values of the primary financial instruments have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The book value represents the net cash received during the year following a restructuring of the Groups interest rate swap portfolio.
This amount is being recognised in the profit and loss account over the life of the original swaps.
RMC Group Annual Report and Accounts 2003 79 Notes to the accounts continued 29.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued f Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile and cross currency swaps to alter the currency profile of its borrowings.
The effect of the cross currency elements of swaps is recognised by revaluation of the currency of swap liability at the accounting date and hence currency elements of swaps are revalued on balance sheet.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is not recognised in the Financial statements until the hedged position matures, i. e. interest is accrued or paid.
