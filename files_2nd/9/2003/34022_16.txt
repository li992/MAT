The current policy of the Group is that local capital requirements are met, as far as possible, by the retention of profit.
Certain countries operate exchange control regulations which limit the amount of dividends that can be remitted to non-resident shareholders.
It is not possible to determine the amount of profit retained and other reserves that is restricted by these regulations, but the net profit retained of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures at 31st December 2003 totalled 925m 2002: 1,038m, 2001: 1,190m.
If such overseas reserves were to be remitted, other tax liabilities, which have not been provided for in the accounts, might arise.
Goodwill amounting to 205m 2002: 205m, 2001: 215m has been charged directly against reserves in prior years in respect of acquisitions.
This amount is net of any goodwill attributable to subsidiary undertakings disposed of prior to the balance sheet date.
In 1998, the Group established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST for the purposes of delivering shares on the exercise of options under the SAYE.
During 2003 the Group received from the trustees of the QUEST 88m 2002: 122m, 2001: 195m on the issue of shares in respect of the exercise of options awarded under SAYE.
Of the amount received from the trustees, employees paid 53m 2002: 76m, 2001: 90m and the balance of 35m 2002: 46m, 2001: 105m comprised utilisation of contribution to the QUEST from Group Companies together with net interest earned thereon.
During 2003 the Barclays Group PSP & ESOS Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT ceased to be used to facilitate the provision of Barclays PLC shares to participants exercising rollover options under the Woolwich plc 1998 Executive Share Option Plan WESOP.
During 2003, the Group received from the trustees of this trust nil 2002: 8m and 2001: 6m on the issue of shares in respect of the exercise of options awarded under WESOP.
Of the amount received from the trustees, employees paid nil 2002: 6m and 2001: 4m and the balance of nil 2002: 2m and 2001: 2m comprised contribution to the trust from Group Companies.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 127 Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31st December 2003 4 Pensions, post-retirement benets and other staff costs Pensions The UK Retirement Fund UKRF comprises four sections: The 1964 Pension Scheme Most employees recruited before July 1997 are members of this non-contributory dened benefit scheme.
Pensions are calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary and are normally subject to a deduction from State Pension age.
The Retirement Investment Scheme RIS A dened contribution plan for most new joiners up to 1st October 2003.
Between 5.5% and 13.5% of pensionable pay is credited to members retirement accounts in addition to contributions paid by the members themselves: precise amounts are dependent upon each members age and contribution decision.
This was closed to new entrants on 1st October 2003.
The Pension Investment Plan PIP A dened contribution plan created from 1st July 2001 to provide benets for certain employees of Barclays Capital.
10% of pay is credited to members retirement accounts.
afterwork Combines a contributory cash balance element with a voluntary dened contribution element.
New employees since 1st October 2003 are eligible to join afterwork.
In addition, the large majority of active members of the RIS now closed were transferred to afterwork in respect of future benefit accrual after 1st January 2004.
In addition, the costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benets are generally borne by the UKRF for each of the four sections.
Integration of the Woolwich Pension Fund WPF Under the terms of an agreement between the Bank, the Trustees of the WPF and the Trustees of the UKRF, the liabilities in respect of all pensioners and deferred pensioners, along with consenting active members of the WPF, were transferred into the UKRF on 14th February 2003.
Payments were made on 1st July 2003, with the WPF Trustees transferring assets worth 418m and Woolwich plc making a special contribution of 138m on 4th July 2003.
Formal actuarial valuations of the UKRF are carried out triennially by a professional qualied independent actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was conducted as at 30th September 2001 and expresses the assets and liabilities at market values.
However, in light of the changing market conditions, an interim actuarial review was conducted as at 30th September 2003.
The market value of assets at the interim review date was 10,950m and the valuation revealed a surplus of assets over the accrued liabilities of 158m or 1% after allowing for expected future salary increases.
Whilst this surplus was estimated to be sufficient to allow the Bank to continue its contribution holiday, which commenced in January 1998, for all sections until 2004, it was expected that at this point Bank contributions would recommence at the full rate.
The Bank decided to accelerate these future contributions through a payment of 500m which was paid in December 2003.
As a consequence, further contributions are not expected to be required until at least the start of 2006.
The next formal valuation will be conducted as at 30th September 2004, at which point the position will again be reviewed.
Protected Rights contributions in respect of RIS and PIP members have been paid as required by the contracting-out regulations.
The principal financial assumptions underlying the 2003 interim actuarial review were: Price ination 2.5% Earnings growth 4.0% Dividend growth 4.0% Return on future investments 1964 Scheme 6.5% Pension increases 2.5% afterwork 5.5% The projected unit method was used for the 2003 interim actuarial review.
In calculating the surplus of assets over accrued liabilities, assets were taken at their market value and a discount rate of 6.4% p. a. at 30th September 2003 was used to value the 1964 Pension Scheme accrued liabilities.
This rate of 6.4% was derived by taking a weighted average of the market yields on the day, weighting by reference to the UKRFs strategic asset allocation: for the equity component, allowance was made for future dividend growth.
It is the Banks policy to allow for the results of a new valuation in its pension charge in the year following the valuation date.
Therefore, the 2003 gures shown below reect the 2002 interim actuarial valuation, with the pensions charge in the accounts being reduced over the remaining service lives of the members to take account of the surplus.
Without the benefit of the surplus, the 1964 Pension Scheme charge, based on the 2002 interim valuation, would be 21.1% of the pensionable salaries on the projected unit method assessed using the assumption regarding return on new investments, while contributions to the RIS and PIP would equal the contributions described above plus the costs of ill-health and death in service benets.
128 4 Pensions, post-retirement benets and other staff costs continued 2003 2002 2001 m m m Pension costs vary from regular costs as follows UKRF : Regular costs 221 197 181 Variation from regular costs including interest 90 266 250 131 69 69 Of the total regular cost in 2003 of 221m, 165m relates to the 1964 Pension Scheme, 37m to the RIS and 19m to the PIP.
The regular cost in respect of afterwork, which during 2003 only included new employees from 1st October 2003, was less than 1m.
The approach taken to calculating the pension charge in the accounts for the 1964 Pension Scheme is to take assets and liabilities at market values with effect from 1st January 2003.
The assumptions used to derive the 1964 Pension Scheme pensions charge differ from those shown above in that returns on new investments are assumed to be 6.5% p. a. dividend growth is assumed to be 4.3% p. a and future price ination is assumed to be 2.3% p. a.
A discount rate at 1st January 2003 of 6.8% was used to value the accrued liabilities, derived as explained above, but based on market conditions at 31st December 2002.
This resulted in an accounting surplus of assets over the accrued liabilities and pension prepayments of 544m or 6%, allowing for expected future salary increases.
Spreading the accounting surplus using the straight-line method over the future remaining service lives of the active members would be sufficient to produce a variation from regular cost of 90m including interest.
Total pension costs of the Group are summarised as follows: 2003 2002 2001 m m m The UK Retirement Fund 131 69 69 Other UK pension schemes 17 20 24 Overseas pension schemes 32 22 28 180 27 17 The increase in the pension cost is primarily due to a decrease in the accounting surplus which has resulted in a corresponding decrease in the variation from regular cost.
The Bank also operates a dened benefit scheme for overseas employees of the Bank similar in design to the 1964 Pension Scheme, the Barclays Bank 1951 Pension Fund, which had a formal valuation as at 30th September 2002 and an interim valuation as at 30th September 2003.
The pension charge has been assessed using consistent assumptions to those used for the 1964 Pension Scheme and a credit of 3m 2002: 3m, 2001: 3m is included in Other UK pension schemes.
A net prepayment of 637m was reected in the balance sheet 2002: 137m, which results from the difference between the amounts recognised as costs in the profit and loss account and the amounts funded.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 131 Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31st December 2003 9 Tax continued The tax for the year is lower 2002 and 2001: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% 2002 and 2001: 30%.
The differences are set out below: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Tax charge at average United Kingdom corporation tax rate of 30% 2002: 30%, 2001: 30% 1,153 961 1,027 Prior year adjustments 7 9 28 Effect of change in non-allowable general provisions 2 2 11 Effect of non-allowable property write-downs and depreciation 13 12 17 Effect of Enterprise Zone Allowance 205 Net effect of differing tax rates overseas 95 70 65 Net effect of overseas losses not available for relief in the United Kingdom 12 40 17 Other non-allowable expenses 28 8 21 Gains covered by capital losses brought forward 44 3 49 Goodwill 74 69 67 Other items 17 63 37 Current tax charge 882 989 939 Deferred tax charge 194 34 4 Overall tax charge 1,076 955 943 Effective tax rate % 28.0 29.8 27.5 The charge for the year is based upon a UK corporation tax rate of 30% for the calendar year 2003 2002: 30%, 2001: 30%.
The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the beneficial effects of lower tax on overseas income, recognition of agreed capital gains tax losses and certain non-taxable gains, partially offset by the absence of tax relief on goodwill.
The beneficial effect of the Enterprise Zone Allowance in the current tax charge is offset by a corresponding increase in the deferred tax charge.

The Directors are of the opinion that the likelihood of any such tax liability arising in the foreseeable future is remote.
Tax would become payable only if the investment and consequently virtually all of the Groups activities were disposed of.
The amount of tax payable would be dependent upon the level of capital losses available within the Barclays Group to reduce any capital gains that may arise.
No tax has been calculated on capital gains 2002: nil that might arise on the disposal of properties at their balance sheet amounts.
The aggregate disposal of the property portfolio would not be expected to give rise to a significant gain or loss.
Tax would become payable only if property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
144 31 Deferred tax continued The fair values of certain derivatives and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 46.
For trading balances, where fair values are recognised in the financial statements and mark to market movements included in the profit and loss account, the gains and losses are subject to current tax and no deferred tax arises.
In the case of derivatives used for asset and liability management purposes, tax arises when the gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account at the same time as the hedged item.
Where fair values are disclosed but not recognised, tax would arise if the assets were sold at their fair value.
Tax of 900m 2002: 1,106m would become payable on the sale of the non-trading financial assets for which a valuation has been given.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised on tax losses to the extent that they are not regarded as recoverable in the foreseeable future.
The unrecognised asset of 4m 2002: 24m would be regarded as recoverable to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it was more likely than not that there would be suitable taxable profits from which the tax losses could be deducted.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, associated undertakings and joint ventures.
Such earnings form part of the balance sheet value and are therefore included in the deferred tax of subsidiaries.

It is anticipated that the majority of remaining liabilities and charges will be utilised in 2004.

36 Shares under option The Group has three current schemes that give employees rights to subscribe for shares in Group companies.
A summary of the key terms of the Incentive Share Option Plan ISOP and Sharesave SAYE are described on pages 24 and 25.
The other current scheme is the BGI Equity Ownership Plan EOP which provides for options to be granted to certain management personnel for shares in BGI UK Holdings Ltd, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
Under the terms of the Plan, options are normally exercisable upon vesting.
One-third of the options will generally vest at each anniversary of the grant date over three years.
If unexercised, the options will lapse 10 years after the grant.
At 31st December 2003, 13.5m 2002: 17.8m options were outstanding under the terms of the BGI EOP which would represent a 13.81% interest if exercised, enabling certain management personnel to subscribe for shares in BGI UK Holdings Limited between 2004 and 2013 at prices between 6.11 and 10.92.
One year following the exercise of the option, the shareholder has the right to sell the shares.
Barclays Bank PLC has first refusal to purchase the shares at the most recent agreed valuation.
As at 31st December 2003, the most recently agreed valuation was 15.16 2002: 11.09.
If all the current options were exercised, 128.7m 2002: 158.7m would be subscribed.
At the most recently agreed valuation these shares would be valued at 205.0m, resulting in a gain of 76.3m to the option holders if these shares were sold at this price.
Since the scheme was introduced, options over 4.9m 2002: 0.8m shares have been exercised, of which 4.4m have not been purchased by Barclays Bank PLC and represent a minority interest in Barclays Global Investors Holdings Limited and the Group.
At 31st December 2003, 106m 2002: 127m options were outstanding under the terms of the SAYE Share Option Scheme, 0.6m 2002: 3.8m options were outstanding under the terms of the Woolwich SAYE Scheme, 5.9m 2002: 8.2m options were outstanding under the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme, 4.4m 2002: 8.8m options were outstanding under the terms of the Woolwich ESOP and 98.9m 2002: 77.6m options were outstanding under the terms of the Incentive Share Option Plan, enabling certain Directors and members of staff to subscribe for ordinary shares between 2004 and 2013 at prices ranging from 137p to 562p.

152 44 Contingent liabilities and commitments In common with other banks, the Group conducts business involving acceptances, guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities.
The majority of these facilities are offset by corresponding obligations of third parties.
In addition, there are other off balance sheet financial instruments, including swaps, futures, forwards and option contracts or combinations thereof all commonly known as derivatives, the nominal amounts of which are not reected in the consolidated balance sheet.
Following internationally accepted banking supervisory practice for the calculation of the credit risk associated with such non-derivative off balance sheet items, for the purpose of this Note the contract or underlying principal amounts are either recognised at face value or converted to credit risk equivalents by applying specified conversion factors.
Nature of instruments For a description of the nature of derivative financial instruments, see page 65.
An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on a customer.
The Group expects most acceptances to be presented, but reimbursement by the customer is normally immediate.
Endorsements are residual liabilities of the Group in respect of bills of exchange which have been paid and subsequently rediscounted.
Guarantees and assets pledged as collateral security are generally written by a bank to support the performance of a customer to third parties.
As the Group will only be required to meet these obligations in the event of the customers default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably below their nominal amounts.
Other contingent liabilities include transaction related customs and performance bonds and are, generally, short-term commitments to third parties which are not directly dependent on the customers creditworthiness.
Commitments to lend are agreements to lend to a customer in the future, subject to certain conditions.
Such commitments are either made for a xed period, or have no specic maturity but are cancellable by the lender subject to notice requirements.
Documentary credits commit the Group to make payments to third parties on production of documents, which are usually reimbursed immediately by customers.
The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments with off balance sheet risk as at 31st December 2003.

and other financial instruments continued Maturity analyses of replacement cost and counterparty analyses of net replacement cost The fair value of a derivative contract represents the amount at which that contract could be exchanged in an arms-length transaction, calculated at market rates current at the balance sheet date.
The totals of positive and negative fair values arising on trading derivatives at the balance sheet date have been netted where the Group has a legal right of offset with the relevant counterparty.
The total positive fair value after permitted netting equates to net replacement cost.
The residual replacement cost by maturity and net replacement cost by counterparty analyses of OTC and non-margined exchange traded derivatives held for trading and non-trading purposes at 31st December 2003 and 31st December 2002 are as follows: 2003 2002 Over one Over one year but year but One not more Over One not more Over year or than five five year or than five five less years years Total less years years Total m m m m m m m m Replacement cost by residual maturity Foreign exchange derivatives 8,357 5,862 2,929 17,148 5,627 3,398 1,654 10,679 Interest rate derivatives 5,661 21,332 25,603 52,596 6,387 24,335 32,872 63,594 Equity and stock index derivatives 550 1,952 267 2,769 668 1,335 46 2,049 Commodity derivatives 1,008 851 123 1,982 372 244 85 701 Credit derivatives 11 381 408 800 6 236 448 690 15,587 30,378 29,330 75,295 13,060 29,548 35,105 77,713 Total Total 2003 2002 m m Net replacement cost by counterparty Central Banks 1,046 48 Banks and other financial institutions 8,364 9,469 Other corporate and public bodies 7,010 4,398 16,420 13,915 Potential credit risk exposure The potential credit risk exposure for each product equals net replacement cost as reduced by the fair value of collateral provided by the counterparty.
At 31st December 2003 and 31st December 2002, the potential credit risk exposures in respect of the Groups trading and non-trading OTC derivatives were not signicantly different to net replacement cost.
162 46 Fair values of financial instruments Financial instruments include both financial assets and financial liabilities and also derivatives.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
Wherever possible, the Group has estimated fair value using market prices or data available for instruments with characteristics either identical or similar to those of the instruments held by the Group.
In certain cases, however, including loans and advances to customers, no ready markets currently exist in the UK wherein exchanges between willing parties occur.
Accordingly, various techniques have been developed to estimate what the fair value of such instruments might be.
These estimation techniques are necessarily subjective in nature and involve several assumptions.
There have been no significant changes in the estimation techniques or the methodology used compared with those used at 31st December 2002.
Because a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful.
Readers of these accounts are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Groups financial position.
Fair value information is not provided for items that do not meet the denitions of a financial instrument.
These items include short-term debtors and creditors, intangible assets such as the value of the Groups branch network, the long-term relationships with depositors core deposit intangibles, premises and equipment and shareholders equity.

b Derivatives held for trading purposes are carried at fair value.
Derivatives held for non-trading purposes are accounted for in accordance with the accounting treatment of the underlying transaction or transactions being hedged.
The fair value of these instruments is estimated using market prices or pricing models consistent with the methods used for valuing similar instruments used for trading purposes.
c Within this calculation, the fair value for loans and advances to banks was estimated using discounted cash ows, applying either market rates, where practicable, or rates currently offered by other financial institutions for placings with similar characteristics.
d The Group provides lending facilities of varying rates and maturities to corporate and personal customers.
In estimating the fair value of such instruments, the fair value of personal and corporate loans subject to variable interest rates is considered to approximate the carrying value.
The fair value of such instruments subject to xed interest rates was estimated by discounting cash ows using market rates or rates normally offered by the Group.
e The valuation of listed securities and investments is at quoted market prices and that of unlisted securities and investments is based on the Directors estimate, which takes into consideration discounted cash ows, price earnings ratios and other suitable valuation techniques.
f Fair values of deposit liabilities payable on demand interest free, interest bearing and savings deposits approximate to their carrying value.
The fair value of all other deposits and other borrowings was estimated using discounted cash ows, applying either market rates, where practicable, or rates currently offered by the Group for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
g Fair values of short-term debt securities in issue are approximately equal to their carrying amount.
Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where these are unavailable, are estimated using other valuation techniques.
h The estimated fair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital were based upon quoted market rates for the issue concerned or equivalent issues with similar terms and conditions.
164 47 Legal proceedings Proceedings have been brought in the US against a number of defendants including Barclays following the collapse of Enron.
In each case the claims are against groups of defendants and it is not possible to estimate Barclays possible loss, if any, in relation to them.
Barclays considers that the claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously.
A court ordered mediation commenced in September 2003 but no material progress has been made towards a resolution of the litigation.
Barclays is engaged in various other litigation proceedings both in the UK and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the US, involving claims by and against it, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Barclays does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Barclays is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position or profitability of the Group.

Such principles vary in significant respects from those generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
Preparing the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported income, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results could be different from those estimates.
The significant differences applicable to the Groups accounts are summarised below.
UK GAAP US GAAP Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiary and associated Prior to 1st January 2002, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over undertakings and joint ventures is capitalised and amortised through its useful economic life under the provisions of APB16.

In the US GAAP can require the recognition of certain assets and liabilities that event of a subsequent disposal, any goodwill previously charged directly would either not be recognised or have a different measurement value against reserves will be written back and reected in the profit or under UK GAAP.
This will lead to a different value of goodwill for US loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised under UK GAAP only if they are Intangible assets are recognised as an asset apart from goodwill if they separately identiable and can be disposed of without disposing arise from contractual or other legal rights regardless of whether these of a business of the entity.

Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
Pensions In respect of dened benefit schemes, pension fund assets are assessed In respect of dened benefit schemes, the same basic actuarial method actuarially at the present value of the expected future investment is used under SFAS 87 as under UK GAAP, but certain assumptions differ, income, which is consistent with SSAP 24.
Most liabilities are discounted assets are assessed at fair value and liabilities are assessed at current at a long-term interest rate and variations from regular cost are settlement rates.
Certain variations from regular cost are allocated in allocated over the expected average remaining service lives of current equal amounts over the average remaining service lives of current employees.

Post-retirement benets Where appropriate, post-retirement health care liabilities are assessed Under SFAS 106, there are certain differences in the actuarial method actuarially on a similar basis to pension liabilities under SSAP 24 and are used and variations in the computation of regular cost as compared discounted at a long-term rate.
Variations from regular cost are with UK GAAP.

Where an actuarial basis is not appropriate, provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated.

Under FIN 46, a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity is present where an enterprise has a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, that will absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both.
The enterprise with a controlling financial interest is the primary beneciary and is required to consolidate the VIE for entities established subsequent to 1st February 2003.
This requirement will apply to all VIEs established prior to 31st January 2003 from 2004.
In accordance with SFAS 140 and FIN 46, QSPEs are not consolidated.

143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
SFAS 143 requires a provision to be raised for the legal obligation in relation to the other-than-temporary removal of a tangible xed asset, at fair value, when incurred.
The Standard was effective for the Group from 1st January 2003.
Adoption did not have a material effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations as determined under US GAAP.
SFAS 146: Accounting for costs associated with exits or disposals In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exits or Disposals.
SFAS 146 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that the fair value of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised when the liability is incurred and nullifies EITF 94-3 which requires the recognition of a liability at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan.
SFAS 146 is effective from 1st January 2003 and was adopted by the Group during the year ended 31st December 2003.
EITF Issue 02-03: Issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management activities The principal requirement affecting the Group is that, for energy derivative contracts with effect from July 2002 and non-energy contracts with effect from 21st November 2002, where the fair value is not determined using either observable market prices or models which use market-observable variables as inputs, the unrealised gain or loss at inception on new contracts should not be recognised.
Adoption did not have a material effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations as determined under US GAAP in 2002.
The impact in 2003 is reected in Note 61 o on page 195.
FIN 45: Guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
45 Guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others.
FIN 45 requires a liability to be recognised for all obligations assumed under guarantees issued and requires disclosure by guarantors in respect of guarantees issued including guarantees embedded in other contracts.
The disclosure requirements are effective for periods ending after 15th December 2002 and are reected on pages 200 to 201 in this report.
The measurement requirements are effective for guarantees issued from 1st January 2003 and were adopted by the Group during the year ended 31st December 2003.
The impact in 2003 on net income of 8 m is shown on page 185.
FIN 46: Consolidation of variable interest entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 Consolidation of Variables Interest Entities, as an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
This was revised in December 2003 and reissued as FIN 46-R. FIN 46 addresses consolidation of variable interest entities VIEs by parties holding variable interests in these entities.
An entity is considered a VIE if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or if the equity investors lack one of three characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
First, the equity investors lack the ability to make decisions about the entitys activities through voting rights or similar rights.
Second, they do not bear the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur.
Lastly, they do not claim the right to receive expected returns of the entity if they occur, which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses.
FIN 46 requires that VIEs be consolidated by the interest holder exposed to the majority of the entitys expected losses or residual returns, that is, the primary beneciary.
In accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46, the Group adopted FIN 46 immediately for all VIEs created or acquired after 31st January 2003 and as at 31st December 2003 consolidates certain asset securitisation entities described in Note 61 p on page 196.
The Group will adopt FIN 46-R for all VIEs in 2004.
Disclosures in relation to the nature, size and potential maximum loss in relation to other VIEs created or acquired before 1st February 2003 where it is reasonably possible the Group will consolidate these entities on adoption of FIN 46-R, or where the Group is not the primary beneciary but has a significant variable interest are reected in Note 61 p of this report.

132 revised 2003, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benets.
132 revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other post-retirement benets by requiring additional disclosures such as descriptions of the types of plan assets, investment strategies, measurement dates, plan obligations, cash ows and components of net periodic benefit costs recognised during interim periods.
The statement does not change the measurement or recognition of the plans.
The additional disclosures for plans established in the UK are generally required for the year ended 31st December 2003 and are included in Note 61 c below.
The remaining disclosures including those in respect of foreign plans are required for years ending after 15th June 2004 and therefore will be adopted by the Group during the year ended 31st December 2004.
SFAS 150: Accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
The statement changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity and requires that these instruments be classied as liabilities in the statement of financial position.
The statement is effective prospectively for financial instruments entered into or modied after 31st May 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after 15th June 2003.
The Group has adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No.
150 to all financial instruments entered into or modied after 31st May 2003 during the year ended 31st December 2003.
The Group will adopt the Standard for other financial instruments during the six months ending 30th June 2004.
Management does not expect adoption to have a material effect on the rms financial condition or results of operations as determined under US GAAP.
SOP 03-3: Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer The SOP addresses accounting for differences between the contractual cash ows and cash ows expected to be collected from an investors initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable to credit quality.
This SOP is effective for loans acquired in accounting periods beginning after 15th December 2004.
Barclays is currently assessing the impact of this SOP on its US GAAP reconciliations.
International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS The European Parliament and Council of the European Union issued a regulation in 2002 that will require all EU listed companies to prepare their consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS rather than the existing national GAAP.
The regulation takes effect from 2005 and consequently the accounting framework under which the Group reports will change.
The Group will produce its consolidated accounts in accordance with IFRS for the year ended 31st December 2005.
Barclays is currently assessing the impact of this change on its US GAAP reconciliations.
For further details on the conversion to IFRS, see pages 118 to 119.

The excess of pension plan assets over the projected benefit obligation, as at the transition date, is recognised as a reduction of pension expense on a prospective basis over approximately 15 years.
The provisions of US GAAP have been applied to the main UK pension scheme, the UK Retirement Fund UKRF and the Woolwich Pension Fund WPF based on a valuation date of 30th September 2003.
Consequently the 500m contribution made to the UKRF in December 2003 is excluded from the US GAAP analysis.
The following analysis relates to the UKRF 1964 Pension Scheme, Retirement Investment Scheme and Pension Investment Plan and the WPF which together make up approximately 95% of all the Groups schemes in terms of assets and actuarial liabilities.
Under the terms of an agreement between the Bank, the Trustees of the WPF and the Trustees of the UKRF, the liabilities in respect of all pensioners and deferred pensioners, along with consenting active members of the WPF, were transferred into the UKRF on 14th February 2003.
186 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued c Pensions and post-retirement benets continued The components of the pension and post-retirements expense where an actuarial basis is appropriate which arise under US GAAP are as follows: 2003 2002 2001  retirement retirement Pensions benets Pensions benets Pensions benets m m m m m m Components of net periodic benefit cost Service cost 292 1 2751 3741 Interest cost 630 5 624 5 652 3 Expected return on plan assets 664 807 854 Amortisation of transition adjustment 12 1 23 1 23 1 Curtailment and termination benets 76 2 5 Recognised net actuarial deficit 33 2 1 1 Net periodic benefit cost 279 9 145 10 144 6 For measurement purposes, the calculation assumes a 12% and 5% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benets and dental benets respectively for pensioners in schemes in the US.
The medical benefit rate is further assumed to reduce steadily each year to 5% in 2008 and remain at that level thereafter.
For pensioners in schemes in the UK a 5.6% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benets is assumed.

This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns, and some asset classes will be more volatile than others.
One of the factors in the choice of a long-term strategy is to ensure that the investments are adequately diversied.
The managers are permitted some exibility to vary the asset allocation from the long-term strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.

Employer cash contributions for the year to 31st December 2004 for the UKRF and WPF schemes are expected to be 4m and 3m respectively.
In accordance with US GAAP requirements, the actuaries for the pension plans used the following assumptions on a weighted average basis: discount rate of 5.4% 2002: 5.3%, 2001: 6.0%, rate of compensation increase of 4.1% 2002: 3.75%, 2001: 4.0%, and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.8% 2002: 6.8%, 2001: 7.5%.
Details of the post-retirement health care expense under UK GAAP are given in Note 4 to the accounts.
In accordance with the US GAAP requirements, the accounting for the post-retirement benets charge assumed a discount rate of 6.25% 2002: 6.75%, 2001: 7.25% for US benets and 5.4% 2002: 5.3%, 2001: 6.0% for UK benets on a weighted average basis.

The ESOS is a long-term incentive scheme and was available by invitation to certain senior executives of the Group with grants usually made annually.
Options were issued at the market price at the date of the grant without any discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the Scheme, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date.
No further awards are made under ESOS.
Eligible employees in the UK may participate in the SAYE.
Under this Scheme, employees may enter into contracts to save up to 250 per month and, at the expiry of a xed term of three, five or seven years, have the option to use these savings to acquire shares in the Company at a discount, calculated in accordance with the rules of the Scheme.
The discount is currently 20% of the market price at the date the options were granted.
The ISOP has been introduced to replace the ESOS.
It is open by invitation to the employees and Directors of Barclays PLC.
Options are granted at the market price at the date of grant calculated in accordance with the rules of the Plan, and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from that date.
The final number of shares over which the option may be exercised will be determined by reference to set performance criteria.
The number of shares under option represents the maximum possible number that may be exercised.
The BGI Equity Ownership Plan is extended to senior employees of BGI.
The exercise price of the options is determined by formula at the date of grant and is not less than the market value of the share at the time of grant.
The options are granted over shares in BGI UK Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
Options are normally not exercisable until vesting, with a third of the options held becoming exercisable at each anniversary of grant.
Options lapse ten years after grant.
At 31st December 2003 13.5m 2002: 17.8m options were outstanding under the terms of the BGI Equity Ownership Plan enabling certain members of staff to subscribe for shares in BGI UK Holdings Limited between 2004 and 2013 at prices between 6.11 and 10.92. f Shareholders interest in the long-term assurance fund The adjustment to US GAAP net income in 2003 of 6 m 2002: 109m, 2001: 87m reects the recovery in equity markets which was largely offset by the impact of the UK activity being closed to new business.

h Fair value of securities Unlisted investment equity securities are outside the scope of SFAS 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
Where the securities are held by an investment company within the Group, the securities are carried at fair value.
The unlisted equity securities have a cost of 944m at 31st December 2003 2002: 456m, with a fair value of 1,109m 2002: 456m.
All long investment securities are classied as being available for sale unless the Group has a clear intention and ability to hold them to maturity.
Other debt securities are classied as trading securities see Note 17.
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 193 Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31st December 2003 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued h Fair value of securities continued The following table shows the gross unrealised losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealised loss position at 31st December 2003.

This review considers factors such as the duration and amount at which fair value is below cost, the credit standing and prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Group to hold the investment security for such sufficient time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
Under US GAAP, 87 investment debt securities had unrealised losses as at 31st December 2003.
Based on the review performed at 31st December 2003, management believes that the unrealised losses as at that date are temporary in nature.
The unrealised losses are due to market moves in interest rates.
The credit quality of the bond issuers remains strong with 100% rated as investment grade or higher, and these investments are also intended to be held for the longer term such that their fair value is expected to recover.
i Revaluation of property In 1990, 449m of property revaluation reserve was capitalised by the issue of bonus shares.
j Loan impairment and disclosure SFAS 114 applies only to impaired loans, the measurement of which is based upon the present value of expected future cash ows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans observable market value, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
Smaller balance homogeneous consumer loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are outside the scope of SFAS 114, as are debt securities and leases.
At 31st December 2003, the element of impaired loans outside the scope of SFAS 114 amounted to 1,777m 2002: 1,922m.
In accordance with SFAS 114, the Groups total impaired loans are those reported as non-performing on page 51, less impaired loans outside the scope of SFAS 114, and amount to 2,378m at 31st December 2003 2002: 2,604m.
Credit risk provisions of 1,340m, estimated in accordance with SFAS 114, were held against these loans 2002: 1,335m.
The average level of such impaired lendings in 2003 was 2,533m 2002: 2,147m.
Where cash received represents the realisation of security, or there is doubt regarding the recovery of a loan, such receipts are treated as repayments of the loan principal.
Otherwise, cash received in respect of impaired loans is recognised as interest income.
Estimated interest income which was recognised in 2003 on impaired loans within the scope of SFAS 114 was 28m 2002: 5m.
SFAS 114 modies the accounting for in-substance foreclosure, in that collateralised debts where the Group takes physical possession of the collateral, regardless of formal insolvency procedures, would be reclassied as if the collateral had been acquired for cash.
At 31st December 2003, under US GAAP, the amount of collateral recorded at the lower of the book value of the debt or the fair value of the collateral that would be reclassied as other real estate owned was 11m 2002: 6m and as debt and equity instruments was 48m 2002: 6m.

During the year 645m of loans were sold 2002: nil generating a net loss of 10m 2002: nil.
k Business combination In 2002, Barclays and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce completed the combination of their retail, corporate and offshore banking operations and created FirstCaribbean International Bank.
Under both UK and US GAAP, Barclays accounts for the resulting interest as an associate.
The transaction generated a gain of 206m under both UK and US GAAP, the gain being recorded through the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses for UK GAAP under UITF 31 but in the income statement account under US GAAP APB 29 and EITF 01-02.
The net assets of the business transferred by Barclays to the new entity are not materially different under US GAAP.
In 2003, an adjustment of 4 m was made to the gain of 206m, also recognised under UK GAAP in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
l Provisions for restructuring of business During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Group has continued its existing programmes to reduce the workforce.
Costs under these programmes, in all three years, have primarily been incurred in Personal Financial Services, Barclays Private Clients and Business Banking.
In addition, significant costs were also incurred in Other operations during 2001 and Barclays Capital 2001.
The restructuring programmes are largely focused on activities within the UK involving a reshaping of the Groups operations through the centralisation of core processes and the application of new technologies.
During 2003, a restructuring charge of 209m 2002: 187m, 2001: 171m was booked under UK GAAP, reecting severance and other termination costs of 146m 2002: 124m, 2001: 114m, costs in connection with planned disposition of certain facilities 28m 2002: 27m, 2001: 38m and other related costs of 35m 2002: 36m, 2001: 19m.
Of the 2003 charge, nil has been disallowed for US GAAP purposes.
Of the 2002 charge under EITF 94-3, 5m was disallowed in 2002 and charged in 2003.
Of the 2001 charge 11m was disallowed in 2001, 4m was charged in 2002 and 7m was charged in 2003.
Of the 2000 charge, 10m was disallowed in 2000, 13m was disallowed in 2001, 19m was charged in 2002 and 4m was charged in 2003.
194 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued l Provisions for restructuring of business continued The US GAAP balance sheet liability at 31st December 2003 was 71m 2002: 68m of which 37m 2002: 31m was in respect of staff reduction costs covering an anticipated 1,000 employees 2002: 800, 12m 2002: 29m in respect of the planned disposition of certain facilities and 22m 2002: 8m covering other related costs.
Costs in the year to 31st December 2003 amounted to 183m 2002: 132m in respect of a staff reduction of 4,400 employees 2002: 2,600, 45m 2002: 37m relating to disposition of facilities and 27m 2002: 31m for other related costs.

Capitalised costs which are no longer considered recoverable are written off.
n Foreign exchange on available for sale securities Within individual legal entities Barclays holds securities in a number of different currencies which are classied as available for sale.
In general, no foreign exchange exposure arises from this because, although the value of the assets changes in sterling terms according to the exchange rate, there is an identical offsetting change in the sterling value of the related funding.
Under UK GAAP both the assets and the liabilities are generally translated at closing exchange rates and the differences between historical book value and current value are reected in the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the change in value of the investments is taken directly to reserves while the offsetting change in sterling terms of the borrowing is taken to the income statement.
A similar difference arises where foreign currency assets are covered using forward contracts but where the Group does not manage these hedges to conform with the detailed US designation requirements.
The impact of this requirement is to transfer net foreign exchange gains or losses on currency securities from net income to other comprehensive income.
No difference between the Groups UK and US GAAP shareholders equity arises from this transfer.
o Derivatives SFAS 133 requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value.
If certain conditions are met then the derivative may be designated as a fair value hedge, cash ow hedge or hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
Barclays has chosen not to update the documentation of hedges to fully comply with the requirements of SFAS 133 and therefore, in general, economic hedge relationships do not qualify for treatment as hedges under US GAAP.
Accordingly, adjustments in current or past periods to US GAAP net income in respect of derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP, are not necessarily indicative of the magnitude or direction of such adjustments to US GAAP net income in subsequent periods.
The adjustment to net income comprises the following elements: b 2003 2002 2001 m m m a Mark to market adjustment 761 548 476 Embedded derivatives 194 109 90 Deferred gains and losses 46 12 28 Amortisation of fair value hedge 140 156 128 Reclassication of gains and losses from Other comprehensive income to net income 39 40 28 Hedges of available for sale securities 20 1,102 553 278 Note a EITF 02-03 was claried in November 2002 to require the measurement of the derivative fair values based on quoted market prices, or in the absence of quoted market prices, valuation techniques with observable inputs from active markets.
For all Over The Counter derivatives which contain significant valuation inputs not currently evidenced by observable market inputs, inception gains and losses have been fully reserved.
They will be released as and when the inputs become observable.

Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 195 Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31st December 2003 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued p Consolidation Under US GAAP, the differences in the consolidation criteria to UK GAAP results in an increase in total assets of 5,829m 2002: 2,738m.
Under US GAAP, the Group consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest.
This is determined by initially evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity, a variable interest entity VIE, or a qualifying special purpose entity QSPE.
Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable each entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with the obligation to absorb losses, the rights to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entitys activities.
Voting interest entities are consolidated in accordance with ARB 51 which states that the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in an entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.
Variable interest entities As dened in FIN 46 and FIN 46-R, an entity is considered a VIE subject to consolidation if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or if the equity investors lack one of three characteristics of a controlling financial interest described above.
Lastly, they do not claim the right to receive expected returns of the entity if they occur, which are the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses.
VIEs are consolidated by the interest holder that remains exposed to the majority of the entitys expected losses or residual returns, that is, the primary beneciary.
The business activities within the Barclays Group where VIEs are used include multi-seller conduit programmes, asset securitisations, client intermediation and the credit structuring.
Multi-seller conduit programmes Barclays creates, administers and provides liquidity and credit enhancements to several commercial paper conduit programmes, primarily in the United States.
These conduits provide clients access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing them to sell consumer or trade receivables to the conduit, which then issues commercial paper to investors to fund the purchase.
The conduits have sufficient collateral, credit enhancements and liquidity support to maintain an investment grade rating for the commercial paper.
Asset securitisations The Group assists companies with the formation of asset securitisations.
These entities have minimal equity and rely upon funding in the form of notes to purchase the assets for securitisation.
The Group provides both senior and or junior lending and derivative contracts to the entities, Where junior notes are provided and in certain circumstances where derivative contracts are provided, the Group may be the primary beneciary of the entity.
Client intermediation As a financial intermediary, the Group is involved in structuring transactions to meet investor and client needs.
These transactions may involve entities that fall within the scope of FIN 46 structured by either Barclays or the client and that are used to modify cash ows of third-party assets to create investments with specic risk or return proles, or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks.
These transactions may include derivative instruments, and often contain contractual clauses to enable Barclays to terminate the transaction under certain circumstances, for example, if the legal or accounting basis on which the transaction was completed changes.
In addition, Barclays invests as a limited partner in lessor partnerships and as a parent in wholly owned subsidiaries specically to acquire assets for leasing.
In a portion of these leasing transactions, there may be risk mitigants in place which result in a third-party consolidating the entities as the primary beneciary.
Credit structuring The Group structures investments to provide specic risk proles to investors.
This may involve the sale of credit exposures, often by way of credit derivatives, to an entity which subsequently funds the credit exposures by issuing securities.
These securities may initially be held by Barclays prior to sale outside of the Group.
In accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46, the Group adopted FIN 46 immediately for all VIEs created or acquired after 31st January 2003.
The Group is the primary beneciary in the following variable entities created or acquired after that date: Total assets Activity m Asset securitisations 4,982 Total 4,982 The creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Group in respect of the variable interest entities consolidated by the Group.
Under UK GAAP, the Group consolidates all of the above entities with the exception of certain asset securitisation entities.
196 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued p Consolidation continued The Group also has significant variable interests in certain asset securitisations and client intermediation entities, created or acquired after 31st January 2003 where the Group is not the primary beneciary.

Where it is reasonably possible the Group will be the primary beneciary and therefore be required to consolidate the following types of entities on adoption of FIN46-R or that the Group will have a significant variable interest, the maximum loss and total assets have been provided below.

It does not provide an indication of ongoing exposure which is managed within the Groups risk management framework.
Where a maximum exposure to loss is quoted, this represents the Groups total exposure and includes both drawn and undrawn lending facilities.
The Groups exposure is determined by changes in the value of the variable interests it holds within these entities, which primarily comprise liquidity, credit enhancements, derivative transactions and nancing arrangements.
b Currently consolidated under US GAAP as at 31st December 2003 using guidance provided by EITF90-15 and Topic D-14 where the Group holds a majority of the entitys substantive risks and rewards.
c Represents commitments to provide liquidity up to this amount.
These would be required to be provided in the event of the conduits access to funding markets being restricted.
Qualifying Special Purpose Entities QSPEs In accordance with SFAS 140 and FIN 46, the Group does not consolidate QSPEs.
QSPEs are passive entities used by the Group to hold financial assets transferred to them by the Group and are commonly used in mortgage and other securitisation transactions as described in Note 61 q below.
Prior to the adoption of FIN 46, the Group consolidated all non-qualifying SPEs if the Group controlled the SPE and held a majority of the SPEs substantive risks and rewards.
q Securitisations Credit card securitisations The Group transfers portfolios of credit card receivable assets to Gracechurch Receivables Trustee Limited.
Barclaycard Funding PLC, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank, has an equitable interest in the cash ows arising from the securitised assets and has issued Loan Note Certicates to the Gracechurch Card Funding vehicles which are Qualifying Special Purpose Entities QSPEs.
QSPEs sell the Medium Term Notes to investors entitling them to receive specified cash ows during the life of the security.
The proceeds of the issuance of Medium Term Notes are then distributed by the QSPEs to the Group as consideration for the Loan Note Certicates transferred.
Following a securitisation, the Group receives fees for servicing the receivables and providing cash management services and payment of deferred consideration for the sale of the beneficial interest in the excess income over and above the interest paid to the noteholder.
The Group maintains an interest in the pool of receivables that are available for securitisation, referred to as the sellers interest.
Investors have no recourse against the Group if cash ows generated from the securitised assets are not sufficient to service the obligations of the QSPEs.
The Group has no right or obligation to repurchase the benefit of any securitised balance, except if certain representations and warranties given by the Group at the time of transfer are breached.
The Group has entered into interest rate currency swaps with the QSPEs.
These swaps convert a proportion of the Sterling variable interest ows arising from the Loan Note Certicates to US Dollar variable and xed rate interest ows to match the interest payable on the Medium Term Notes issued.
Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 197 Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31st December 2003 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued q Securitisations continued The transfer of receivables is accounted for as a sale under US GAAP where control of the receivables has been relinquished.
A gain or loss is recognised on securitisation of the receivables which is calculated based on the previous carrying amount of the loans involved in the transfer allocated between the receivables sold and the sellers interest based on their relative fair values at the date of sale.
The Group estimates the fair value of the retained interests by determining the present value of future expected cash ows using valuation models that incorporate managements best estimates of key assumptions, which include: a the expected prepayment rate of the receivables each year: b the anticipated credit losses from the receivables: and c a discount rate to calculate future income ows.
The retained interests that are subject to prepayment risk such that the Group may not recover substantially all of its investment are recorded at fair value with subsequent adjustments reected in net income.
The servicing liability represents the shortfall of future servicing income from the Groups obligation to service the transferred assets compared to the costs of servicing those assets.
The servicing liability is amortised over the expected life of the receivables.
Securitisation activity during the year During 2003, the Group securitised credit card receivables with a book value of 2,508m recognising a resultant pre-tax gain on sale of 132m.
The Group has recognised an interest only strip asset and a servicing liability in connection with the transfer.
The derecognition of the securitised assets results in a reduction in net loans and advances to customers of 2,447m.
Interest only strip The movement in fair value of retained interests during the period is as follows: Credit card receivables m Value at inception 107 Transfer to net income 10 Value at 31st December 2003 97 Key economic assumptions used in measuring the interest only strip at the time of the securitisation during 2003 were as follows: Year ended 31st December 2003 Credit card receivables Fair value of interest only strip 107m Constant prepayment rate per annum 100% a Credit losses per annum 5.3% Discount rate 5.0% Note a Annual percentage credit loss is based only on positions in which expected credit loss is a key assumption in the determination of fair values.
198 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued q Securitisations continued Servicing liabilities The following table shows the servicing liabilities recognised and amortised during the period: Credit card receivables m Balance at inception 31 Amortisation for the year 3 Balance at 31st December 2003 28 The cash ows between the Group and the securitisation vehicles were as follows during the year ended 31st December 2003: Credit card receivables m Proceeds from new securitisations 2,508 Proceeds from collection reinvested in receivables 4,277 Cash inow from servicing fees 13 Cash inow on interests retained 149 Interest only strip at year end At 31 December 2003, key economic assumptions and a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the fair value of those interests of two unfavourable variations from the expected levels for each key assumption are as follows: Year ended 31st December 2003 Credit card receivables Fair value of interest only strip 97m Constant prepayment rate per annum 100% Impact of 33% adverse change 13 m Impact of 50% adverse change 38 m a Credit losses per annum 5.3% Impact of 10% adverse change 6 m Impact of 20% adverse change 13 m Discount rate 5.0% Impact of 10% adverse change 8 m Impact of 20% adverse change 16 m Note a Annual percentage credit loss is based only on positions in which expected credit loss is a key assumption in the determination of fair values.
The sensitivity analysis illustrates the potential magnitude of significant adverse changes in key assumptions used in valuing the interest only strip.
However, changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear.
Furthermore, the sensitivities for each key variable are calculated independently of changes in the other key variables.

Credit card receivables TotalDelinquent Net a b loans loans write-offs m m m Total receivables managed 11,078 228 438 c Less: receivables securitised 2,508 36 52 Assets on US GAAP balance sheet 8,570 192 386 Notes a Delinquent loans are loans 90 days or more past due b Net of recoveries during the year c Securitised and derecognised from the balance sheet under US GAAP Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 199 Notes to the Accounts For the Year Ended 31st December 2003 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued r Fair value amortisation credit Fair value adjustments that are different from those recognised under UK GAAP are amortised over the expected life of the relevant asset liability.
This resulted in an additional credit of 8m 2002: 8m, 2001: 8m under US GAAP.
s Collateral Under a repo sale and repurchase agreement, an asset is sold to a counterparty with a commitment to repurchase it at a future date at an agreed price.
The Group engages in repos and reverse repos, which are the same transaction in the opposite direction, i. e. the Group buying an asset with a xed commitment to resell.
The following amounts were included in the balance sheet for repos and reverse repos and are reported on a net basis where permitted: 2003 2002 2001 m m m Reverse repos assets Loans and advances to banks 50,392 41,001 32,042 Loans and advances to customers 49,962 42,505 29,731 100,354 83,506 61,773 Repos liabilities Deposits by banks 39,810 37,857 25,048 Customer accounts 23,661 24,580 16,204 63,471 62,437 41,252 The average and maximum amount of reverse repos for 2003 were 109,315m and 137,025m 2002: 76,215m and 103,895m, 2001: 95,849m and 119,942m respectively.
Reverse repos and stock borrowing transactions are accounted for as collateralised loans.
It is the Groups policy to seek collateral at the outset equal to 100% to 105% of the loan amount.
The level of collateral held is monitored daily and further collateral calls made to bring the level of cash held and the market value of collateral in line with the loan balance.
Under certain transactions including reverse repo and stock borrowing transactions the Group is allowed to sell or repledge the collateral held.
At 31st December 2003, the fair value of collateral held was 126,085m 2002: 108,935m of which 91,280m 2002: 93,148m related to items that have been sold or repledged.
Repos and stock lending transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings.
At 31st December 2003, the Group had given 58,316m 2002: 52,427m of its assets as collateral in respect of these transactions.
Of the total collateral given 44,002m 2002: 35,573m was on terms which gave the recipient the right to sell or repledge, comprising debt securities of 43,665m 2002: 33,729m and equity securities of 337m 2002: 1,844m.
The residual 14,314m 2002: 16,854m was on terms by which the counterparty cannot sell or repledge comprised 14,024m 2002: 16,854m of debt securities and 290m 2002: nil of equity securities.
For the pledge of collateral to secure on-balance sheet liabilities see Note 41. t Provisions for bad and doubtful debts During 2003, there was a net write-back of nil 2002: 2m write-back, 2001: 9m charge in respect of credit losses on derivatives.
None of the year end specic provisions related to credit losses on derivatives 2002: nil.
During 2003, there was a net write-back of 14m 2002: nil, 2001: nil of the general provision in the respect of off-balance sheet exposures including derivatives.
At 31st December 2003, nil of the general provision 2002: 14m was held in respect of off-balance sheet exposures including derivatives.
The specic provision for contingent liabilities and commitments is 12m 2002: 14m.
u Guarantees An element of Barclays normal banking business is to issue guarantees on behalf of its customers.
In almost all cases, Barclays will hold collateral against the exposure, have a right of recourse to the customer or both.
In addition, Barclays issues guarantees on its own behalf.
The major categories of these guarantees are: Financial guarantees These are given to banks and financial institutions on behalf of customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.
These are commonly called facility guarantees.
Included within this category are stock borrowing indemnities.
These relate to funds managed by Barclays on behalf of clients, which participate in stock lending programmes.
Barclays indemnifies the clients against any losses incurred by the clients resulting from borrower default.
Collateral, principally cash, is maintained against all stock borrowing transactions ranging from 102% to 105% of the securities loaned with adjustments to collateral made daily.
It is possible that the exposure could exceed the collateral provided should the value of the security rise concurrently with the default of the borrowers.
200 61 Differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP accounting principles continued u Guarantees continued Standby letters of credit These are irrevocable commitments to pay a third party, on behalf of our customers, the value of which on demand is subject to certain criteria being complied with.
Any amounts paid are debited to the customers accounts.
These contracts are used when required in substitution of guarantees due to a greater acceptability in the beneciary country.
Other guarantees This category includes the following types of contracts: Performance guarantees a guarantee given by the bank on behalf of a customer, undertaking to pay a certain sum if our customer has failed to carry out the terms or certain terms of the contract.
Advance payment guarantees enables the beneciary to demand repayment of an advance in funds in certain circumstances.
Tender guarantees provided during a tender process to lend support to a customers commitment to a tender process.
Customs and Excise guarantees provided to HM Customs and Excise to cover a customers liability, most commonly for import duties.
Retention guarantees similar to advance payments but are used to secure early release of retained contract payments.
The following table provides the maturity analysis of guarantees issued by the Group.
The amounts disclosed represent the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the Group could be required to make under the guarantee, before any recovery through recourse or collaterisation provisions.

The maximum liability that Barclays could have is the total credit limits marked to customers of 32,734m 2002: 29,208m.
These limits are included within commitments with a maturity of less than one year, as the limit can be revoked at any time.
Warranties and indemnities given as part of acquisition and disposal activity Warranties and indemnities are routinely provided to counterparties as part of the terms and conditions required in a business acquisition, disposal or investing in joint ventures.
Most commonly, these relate to indemnification against tax liabilities arising from pre-transaction activities.
Usually the total liability in respect of warranties and indemnities for a transaction is capped and the maximum exposure under these is 4,000m 2002: 4,100m.
No collateral or recourse to third parties is generally available.
Certain derivative contracts In addition to the contracts described above, there are certain derivative contracts to which the Group is a counterparty that meet the characteristics of a guarantee under FIN 45.
These derivatives are recorded in the Groups balance sheet at fair value under US GAAP.
Included in other provisions for liabilities and charges is nil 2002: 4m in respect of guarantees.
The Group considers the amounts provided in the balance sheet represent a reasonable estimate of amounts actually anticipated to be paid under such arrangements.
v Total assets The adjustments to total assets arising from the GAAP differences dealt with in the tables on page 185, and Notes p and q amounted to 3,677m 2002: 6,202m.
Additional adjustments arise due to further differences in GAAP, as set out below.
In accordance with ARB No.

The legal form of these products is similar to insurance contracts, which are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 97.
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities associated with these products are recorded on the balance sheet.
The inclusion of acceptances resulted in an increase in total assets under US GAAP of 654m 2002: 2,588m.
w profit and loss account presentation There are certain differences in the presentation of the profit and loss account between UK GAAP and US GAAP.
profits or losses on disposal of Group undertakings 2003: 4m profit, 2002: 3m loss, 2001: 4m loss would be classied as operating income or expense under US GAAP rather than being shown separately.
Under US GAAP, net interest received 2003: 68m, 2002: 75m, 2001: 387m paid relating to trading activities would be shown within net interest revenue, rather than included in dealing profits.
Reconciling differences arising from associated undertakings 2003: 7m profit, 2002: 6m profit, 2001: nil would be included within a single component of net income.
x Changes in UK GAAP During 2003, Barclays restated the 2002 shareholders funds under UK GAAP in respect of changes of accounting policy for the purchase and sales of own shares, as required by UITF 37, as described on page 118.
The restatement had no impact on net income.
There has been no effect on the reported US GAAP gures.

The FSA regards the risk asset ratio calculation, originally developed by the Basel Committee, as a key supervisory tool and sets individual minimum ratio requirements for banks in the UK at or above the minimum of 8%.
The concept of risk weighting and the basis for calculating eligible capital resources are described under capital ratios on page 100.
The following tables summarises capital resources and capital ratios, as dened for supervisory purposes: Barclays PLC Group and Barclays Bank PLC Group Amount Ratio As at 31st December 2003 m % Total net capital resources 24,223 12.8 Tier 1 capital resources 14,994 7.9 Amount Ratio As at 31st December 2002 m % Total net capital resources 22,191 12.8 Tier 1 capital resources 14,204 8.2 64 significant Group concentration of credit risk A concentration of credit risk is dened as existing when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.
Barclays has three significant concentrations of exposures to credit risk: to the UK economy, to home loans, and to banks and other financial institutions.
Credit exposure is concentrated in the UK where the majority of the Groups activities are conducted.
Gross credit exposure to borrowers on the banking book in the UK based on the location of the ofce recording the transaction was 143,809m at 31st December 2003 2002: 135,900m.
In the UK the Groups collateral policy differs by line of business and product, but is broadly in line with UK market practice see also below.
It enters into netting agreements with counterparties in wholesale markets whenever practical and to the extent that such agreements are enforceable in law.
Lending in respect of home loans to customers in the UK and the rest of Europe totalled 72,159m at 31st December 2003 2002: 64,679m.
This represents 42% 2002: 40% of the total banking book lending to customers.
As collateral, Barclays requires a first mortgage over the residential property for the acquisition of which the loan is made.
As an active participant in the international banking markets, the Group has significant credit exposure to banks and other financial institutions.
In total, credit risk exposure to financial institutions at 31st December 2003 was estimated to have amounted to 87bn 2002: 87bn of which 62bn 2002: 60bn consisted of loans and advances to banks and 9bn 2002: 10bn of mark to market balances in respect of derivatives.
The remaining credit risk exposure is largely related to letters of credit and guarantees.
The Group may require collateral before entering into exposure to a bank, depending on the nature of the product or type of exposure and the bank involved.
The Groups policy is to enter into netting agreements with other banks whenever possible and to the extent that such agreements are enforceable in law.
The concentrations of credit exposure described above are not proportionally related to credit loss.
Some segments of the Groups portfolio have and are expected to have proportionally higher credit charges in relation to the exposure than others.
Moreover, the volatility of credit loss is different in different parts of the portfolio.
Thus it is possible that comparatively large credit charges could arise in parts of the portfolio not mentioned above.
