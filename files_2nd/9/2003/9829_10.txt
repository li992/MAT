A summary of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are recorded under the acquisition method and their results are included from the date of acquisition.
Intra-Group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Turnover Turnover, which excludes value added tax and trade discount, represents the value of goods supplied through retail shops and wholesaling.
Retail turnover, which is net of returns, is recognised in the financial statements on a cash basis.
Wholesaling turnover is recognised on despatch of goods to the customer.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the separately identiable net assets acquired, together with associated costs is capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic life.
Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at their purchase price, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition.
Revenue costs relating to opening new stores are expensed as incurred.
Provision for depreciation is made so as to write off the cost of tangible xed assets to their residual value on a straight line basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Depreciation is charged over the following periods: Freehold buildings 50 years Alteration to leasehold premises Over the life of the lease Fixtures, ttings and equipment 3 10 years I. T. software 3 5 years Motor, commercial vehicles and trailers 3 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Foreign currencies The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at year end exchange rates.
profits and losses of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences on these retranslations are taken to the profit and loss reserve.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year, or where appropriate the rate of exchange xed under the terms of the relevant transaction.
All these foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.
36 Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is based on purchase cost on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the price at which stocks can be sold in the normal course of business after deducting costs of realisation.
Provisions are made as appropriate for obsolescence, markdown and shrinkage.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Contributions and other incentives to enter into new operating leases are deferred and released to the profit and loss account in equal annual installments over the period until the next rent review.
Finance leases Leasing agreements, which transfer to the Group substantially all the benets and risks of ownership of an asset, are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in xed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged against profit in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Deferred tax Deferred taxation is recognised in the accounts on all timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be realised in the future, where recognised deferred tax provisions are not discounted.
Investments Investments in own shares, held by trusts and purchased on the open market, are included within investments at cost on a weighted average basis.
Where employee options are granted over these shares, the deficit between the option exercise price and the cost of the shares is written off over the performance period of the option.
Unapproved options granted since April 1999 attract employers national insurance contributions on the gain realised by the option holder.
A provision for employers national insurance on options granted since April 1999, based on the period end closing share prices, is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period between the date of the share option grant and its first available exercise date.
For grants since November 2001, the employers liability is borne by the option holder.
Financial instruments Where the Group is a party to derivative financial instruments, primarily to manage exposures to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, differences between market values and contract values on these derivatives are not recognised until maturity of the contracts.
The resulting gains or losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related currency transaction.
Liquid resources as stated in the cash ow is cash deposited with banking institutions for a xed return over a period of not more than six months.
