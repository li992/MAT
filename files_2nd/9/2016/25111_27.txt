The Company has undergone transition from reporting under UK GAAP to Financial Reporting Standard 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework FRS 101.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101, as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
On transition the Company has applied IFRS 1 paragraphs 6-33 as adopted by the EU, as required under FRS 100 paragraph 11 b.
As a result of the transition there has been no change to the result for the year or to total equity as at 30 September 2015.
As permitted by section 408 3 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account has been presented for the Company.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in the preparation of the financial statements, as detailed below: Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements comparative information requirements in respect of: i paragraph 79 a iv of IAS 1: ii paragraph 118 e of IAS 38 Intangible assets reconciliations between the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period: The following paragraphs of IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements: i 10 d statement of cash flows: ii 10 f a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period when an entity applied an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements, or when it reclassifies items in its financial statement: iii 16 statement of compliance with all IFRS: iv 38A requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements: v 38B-D additional comparative information: vi 40A-D requirements for a third statement of financial position: vii 111 cash flow information: and viii 134-136 capital management disclosures: IAS 7 Statement of cash flows: Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective: Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related party disclosures key management compensation: The requirements in IAS 24 Related party disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13 Fair value measurement disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities: and The requirements of IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards to present a statement of financial position at the date of transition.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, are set out below.
INVESTMENTS Investments held as fixed assets comprise the Companys investment in subsidiaries and are shown at historic purchase cost less any provision for impairment.
Investments are tested for impairment annually to ensure that the carrying value of the investment is supported by their recoverable amount.
DIVIDENDS Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders, whereas interim dividends are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised as an asset when they are approved.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument.
Financial assets are fide-recognised when the rights to receive benefits have expired or been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the obligation is extinguished.
123 Imperial Brands PLC | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 www.
com 123 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF IMPERIAL BRANDS PLC CONTINUED I ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Non-derivative financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement.
For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as loans and payables.
Payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For borrowings, the carrying value includes accrued interest payable.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly liquid investments.
TREASURY SHARES When the Company purchases its own equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity until the shares are reissued or disposed of.
When such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, increases shareholders funds.
When such shares are cancelled they are transferred to the capital redemption reserve.

At 30 September 2016, the contingent liability totalled 18,138 million 2015: 14,123 million.
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2016 and which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file separate financial statements with the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the same article, Imperial Brands PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liabilities for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2016.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar, have therefore availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies Amendment Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the above guarantees and do not consider them to be material.
They have therefore not been recognised on the balance sheet.
IX RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES Details of Directors emoluments and interests are provided within the Directors Remuneration Report.
The Directors Remuneration Report, on pages 51-73 includes details on salary, benefits, pension and share plans.
These disclosures form part of the financial statements.
X FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF FRS 101 This is the first year in respect of which the Company has prepared its financial statements under FRS 101.
The previous financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2015 were prepared under old UK GAAP.
The date of transition to FRS 101 for the Company is 1 October 2014.
Set out below are descriptions of the various implementation options applied by the Company in preparing the financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2016, as well as reconciliations from old UK GAAP to FRS 101 for both total comprehensive income for the year ended 30 September 2015 and total equity as at 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2015.
MANDATORY EXCEPTIONS TO RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION Mandatory exceptions to retrospective application in IFRS 1 applied in converting from old UK GAAP to FRS 101 are in respect of exception for estimates estimates made as at 1 October 2014 under FRS 101 are consistent with those made previously under old UK GAAP.
RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2015, AND TOTAL EQUITY AT 1 OCTOBER 2014 AND 30 SEPTEMBER 2015 The transition from old UK GAAP to FRS 101 has resulted in no change to the reported total comprehensive income for the year ended 30 September 2015, nor to total equity as at 1 October 2014 or 30 September 2015. www.
