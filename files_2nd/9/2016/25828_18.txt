Our audit approach Overview Overall materiality: 4.7 million which represents 0.5% of net assets.
Materiality The Company is a standalone investment trust company and engages JPMorgan Funds Limited the Manager to manage its assets.
We conducted our audit of the financial statements from information provided by JPMorgan Corporate & Investment Bank the Administrator to whom the Manager has, with the consent of the Directors, Audit scope delegated the provision of certain administrative functions.
We tailored the scope of our audit taking into account the types of investments within the Company, the involvement of the third parties referred to above, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Company operates.

focus Valuation and Existence of Investments.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK and Ireland ISAs UK & Ireland.
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus Income We assessed the accounting policy for income recognition for We focused on the completeness and existence of dividend income compliance with accounting standards and the AIC SORP and recognition and its presentation in the Statement of Comprehensive performed testing to check that income had been accounted for in Income as set out in the requirements of the Association of accordance with this stated accounting policy.
Investment Companies Statement of Recommended Practice the We found that the accounting policies implemented were in AIC SORP.
This is because incomplete or in accurate income could accordance with accounting standards and the AIC SORP, and that have material impact on the Companys net assets value and income has been accounted for in accordance with the stated dividend cover.
We also focused on the completion and existence of realised and We understood and assessed the design and implementation of key unrealised gains or losses on the investment portfolio.
In addition, we tested dividend income by agreeing the dividend rates from a sample of investments to independent third party sources.
No misstatements were identified which required reporting to those charged with governance.
To test for completeness, we tested that the appropriate dividends had been received in the year by reference to independent data of dividends declared for a sample of investment holdings in the portfolio.
Our testing did not identify any unrecorded dividends.
We tested the allocation and presentation of dividend income between the revenue and capital return columns of the Statement of Comprehensive Income in line with the requirements set out in the AIC SORP.
We then tested the validity of revenue and capital special dividends to independent third party sources.
We did not find any special dividends that were not treated in accordance with the AIC SORP.
We have also tested the gains or losses on investments held at fair value comprise realised and unrealised gains or losses.
For realised gains or losses, we tested a sample of disposal proceeds to bank statements.
For unrealised gains or losses, we tested the valuation of the portfolio at the year-end, together with testing the reconciliation of opening and closing investments.
No misstatements were identified by our testing which required reporting to those charged with governance.
Valuation and existence of investments We tested the valuation of the listed investment portfolio by The investment portfolio at the year-end principally comprised of agreeing the prices used in the valuation to independent third party listed equity investments of 901 million.
We focused on the valuation and existence of investments because No misstatements were identified by our testing which required investments represent the principal element of the net asset value reporting to those charged with governance.

37 EMIT pp36-44 03 10 2016 14:47 Page 38 Independent Auditors Report continued How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Company operates.
The Companys accounting is delegated to the Administrator who maintain their own accounting records and controls and report to the Manager and the Directors.
As part of our risk assessment, we assessed the control environment in place at both the Manager and the Administrator to the extent relevant to our audit.
This assessment of the operating and accounting structure in place at both organisations involved obtaining and reading the relevant control reports issued by the independent auditor of the Manager and the Administrator in accordance with generally accepted assurance standards for such work.
We then identified those key controls at the Administrator on which we could place reliance to provide audit evidence.
We also assessed the gap period of three months between the period covered by the controls report and the year-end of the Company.
Following this assessment, we applied professional judgement to determine the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements, including whether we needed to perform additional testing in respect of those key controls to support our substantive work.
For the purposes of our audit, we determined that additional testing of controls in place at the Administrator was not required because additional substantive testing was performed.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall materiality 4.7 million 2015: 4.3 million.
How we determined it 0.5% of net assets.
Rationale for We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice for investment trust audits, in the benchmark applied absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate and because we believe that this provides an appropriate and consistent year-on-year basis for our audit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 234,000 2015: 215,000 as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors statement, set out on page 29, in relation to going concern.
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs UK & Ireland we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the Directors statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the Directors statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The going concern basis presumes that the Company has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.
As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting Consistency of other information Companies Act 2006 opinion In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Our responsibilities and those of the Directors As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities set out on page 35, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs UK & Ireland.
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.
We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
