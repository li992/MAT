82 REMUNERATION REPORT Annual implementation report on directors remuneration This report sets out the elements of remuneration paid to directors in respect of the financial year 2015 16.
The notes to the single figure table provide further detail on the elements that make up the total single figure of remuneration in respect of each ofthe executive directors.
This report is subject to an advisory vote at the 2016 AGM.
These numbers are disclosed on an accruals basis, consistent with the calculation of financial results.
The actual cash amounts paid were in line with the annual amounts stated in the policy and implementation reports.
2 For executive directors, the salary in the year is not the same as a weighted average of the headline salaries, since salary actually paid is reduced for pension-related salary sacrifices.
The benefit of these salary sacrifices are captured in the increase in pension entitlements forwhich a remuneration value isshown in the pensions line.
For non-executive directors, the value shown reflects the split across the year from the previous fee rate to the revised rates of 72,500 for non-executive directors, 92,500 for the Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit committee and 390,000 for the Chairman.
The value of George Westons benefits comprised 1,787.81 taken in cash and 14,397.18 taxed as benefits-in-kind.
4 The value of John Basons benefits comprised 6,175.58 taken in cash and 14,397.18 taxed as benefits-in-kind.
5 The value of Charles Sinclairs benefits is taxed as a benefit-in-kind.
6 The annual bonus is paid in December in respect of the preceding financial year.
None of the incentive is subject to deferral.
7 As required by UK regulations, vesting under the LTIP for 201215 has been recalculated to update last years estimates using the actual share price of 3451.794p that applied on vesting.
Information relating to performance targets, weightings and outcomes can be found on page 84 ofthe2015annual report.
No shares will vest under the LTIP for 201316.
8 The single total figure for 2015 has been updated to reflect the LTIP adjustment noted in 7 above.

Their conclusion was that retrospective detail on financial targets set will not be disclosed at this stage.
In future we will disclose the target ranges that apply to STIP when the deferred awards are released two years from the end of the performance period.
We expect that the directors will make the right decisions for the long-term performance of the business, even if this reduces their incentive pay-out under the STIP.
When we disclose the performance range that applied to the STIP, we wish to be able to add any commentary that will help investors tounderstand the performance.
In most cases, this is not appropriate immediately following the end of the year and remains commercially sensitive.
For these reasons, we believe that this delayed disclosure is appropriate.
A discussion of performance against financial targets for STIP 2015 16 can be found on page 70.
Following a review of personal performance against specific objectives for the 2015 16 financial year, the committee determined thatGeorge Weston will receive 13.61% of salary in relation to performance that was on-target against set objectives, with cost reduction and efficiency improvements in a number of businesses but especially in Sugar, a further profit improvement in Ingredients and an excellent performance in Primark.
John Bason will receive 20% of base salary for the individual element oftheannual bonus, reflecting a very strong overall performance, delivering positive outcomes on a number of important transactions.
Personal objectives set for each of the executive directors were closely aligned to the overall strategyofthe groupbut additional details will not be disclosed because of commercial sensitivity.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 201316 The performance measures for each three-year LTIP cycle are set by the committee.
Awards are made annually, at the discretion ofthe committee, and eligible executives receive shares at the end of the performance period, subject to achievement of the performance measures.
For the 201316 cycle the adjusted eps performance range was 113.6p for threshold vesting, 123.6p fortarget vesting and 134.2p for maximum vesting.
In November 2016 executive directors will therefore receive no shares.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 84 REMUNERATION REPORT Scheme interests awarded in 2015 16 audited information Under the remuneration policy that was approved in 2014, conditional share awards were granted under the LTIP each year at the end of November, following announcement of the Companys results.
In addition, further awards were made, following approval by the committee, during the year to new starters or newly promoted individuals who were eligible to participate.
The share price used to determine the number of shares in an allocation was the average of the closing share prices on the five trading days immediately preceding the award date.
All awards are settled using shares bought in the market.
The table below details the conditional share interests awarded to the executive directors during the year in respect of the 2015-18 LTIP.
The awards made were in line with the existing remuneration policy and are subject to performance conditions overthe vesting period.

Taking this into account together with volatility in currency markets and uncertainty of Sugarprofitability as the 2017 reform of the EU sugar regime approaches, the committee determined that the eps performance range for the 2015-18 award should be 112.5p for threshold vesting, 119p for target vesting and 125.7p for maximum vesting.
Thecommittee believed that this range was extremely stretching.
In setting this target, the committee also took into account: the volatility present in many of the non-sugar markets in which the group operates: the scale of investment made in the pursuit of long-term growth: the results of the long-term incentives to date: market expectations: internal forecasts for the next few years: and advice from their appointed remuneration advisors.
As outlined in the remuneration policy, there will be a further two-year holding period in place for the net of tax shares after vesting.
Executive directors shareholding requirements and share interests audited information Under our new remuneration policy, the executive directors are required to build up a beneficially owned shareholding of 250% ofsalary.
This requirement has been met.
The interests below remained the same at 8 November 2016.

TSR performance and Chief Executives pay The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the Company over the seven years from September 2009 to September 2016, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.
Thisindex has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
In addition, the table below the graph provides a summary of the total remuneration of the Chief Executive over the same period.
For the purpose of calculating the value of the remuneration of the Chief Executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent with the single figure methodology as defined in the applicable UK directors reporting regulations.
During the previous 12 months, the market value ranged from 2350p to 3599p.
Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Value of a hypothetical 100 investment 86 REMUNERATION REPORT Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive Between 2015 and 2016, the increase in the Chief Executives salary was 2.2% and the average increase in salaries for our UKemployees was between 1.253.4%.
The total reward for the Chief Executive remained broadly the same as last year, reflecting 0% vesting on the LTIP compared with18.54%vesting in the previous year and an above target payment on the STIP.
The overall increase in expenditure on reward for all employees was 7%.
This number is based on aggregate data presented inthe table below, which include increases in headcount, as it is neither practical nor worthwhile, in a decentralised group ofoursize, to separate the increase in expenditure on incentives and taxable benefits.
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received nocompensation.
John Bason is a non-executive director and chairman of the audit committee of Compass Group PLC, for which he received afeeof 106,000 in the 2015 16 financial year.
He also served as a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas and as chairman ofthecharity FareShare, but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.

These ranges were then tested to ensure that they were sufficiently stretching.
Weare ina period of exceptional economic uncertainty in the post EU referendum environment and the above ranges reflect this.
Theproposed eps range for the Company as a whole takes into account the operating profit of Sugar in 2015 16.
The eps range with Sugar removed is wider this year than we would expect it to be in future as a result of the volatility in foreign exchange ratesandthe risks and opportunities facing our portfolio of non-Sugar businesses.
The ranges and targets with Sugar in and Sugarout are very similar this year: we would not usually expect this to be the case.
