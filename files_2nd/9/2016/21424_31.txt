For all of the risk areas set out above, we have assessed whether the groups disclosures about the sensitivities of the relevant financial statement items to changes in the respective key assumptions appropriately reflect the associated risks and comply with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at $20m 31 December 2015: $20m, determined with reference to a benchmark of 2015 group gross premiums written of which it represents 1%: 31 December 2015: 1%.
In addition, we applied materiality of $10m 31 December 2015: $10m for balances other than the insurance and reinsurance technical balances and investments, for which we believe misstatements of lesser amounts than materiality for the financial statements as a whole could be reasonably expected to influence the companys members assessment of the financial performance of the group.
Audit work to support this opinion is undertaken primarily by an audit team based at Beazleys head office in London.
Of the groups reporting components, we subjected Beazley Holdings Inc, Beazley Services USA and Beazley Insurance Company Inc. to specified risk-focused audit procedures.
These entities were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed and reported to the group and component auditor.
The group audit team instructed component teams as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.
The group audit team also determined the components materiality.
For components outside the scope of our group audit we performed analytical procedures at the aggregated group level.
The group audit team approved component materiality, which was set at $18m 31 December 2015: $20m.
We reported to the audit and risk committee all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with an individual value in excess of $1m $0.5m for non-technical 31 December 2015: $1m $0.5m for non-technical in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
In regards to the Beazley Insurance Company Inc. component team the interaction with the Group team included calls along with review of the audit work performed.
