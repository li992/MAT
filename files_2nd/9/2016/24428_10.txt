Our Assessment of and Response to the Risks of Material Misstatement and Overview of the Scope of Our Audit A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRCs website at www.
uk auditscopeukprivate Our audit approach was developed by obtaining an understanding of the Groups activities, the key functions undertaken on behalf of the Board by the Investment Manager and Administrator and the overall control environment.
Based on this understanding we assessed those aspects of the Groups financial statements which were most likely to give rise to a material misstatement.
The Group audit engagement team was responsible for the audit of all entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
The valuation of investments in the underlying wind farm portfolio was the risk that had the greatest impact on our audit strategy and scope, including the allocation of resources in the audit.
The Audit Committees consideration of this key matter is set out on page 34.

For each of the key assumptions in the valuation models, we considered the appropriateness of the assumption and whether alternative reasonable assumptions could have been applied.
We considered each assumption in isolation as well as in conjunction with other assumptions and the valuation as a whole.
Where appropriate, we sensitised the valuations where other reasonable alternative assumptions could have been applied.
We also considered the completeness and clarity of disclosures regarding the range of reasonable alternative assumptions in the financial statements.
Based on our procedures performed we concluded that the valuation of the investment portfolio was considered to be within an acceptable range.
37 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 Independent Auditors Report continued Our Application of Materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.
For planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could inuence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Importantly, misstatements below this level will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identied misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
The application of these key considerations gives rise to two levels of materiality for the Group, the quantum and purpose of which are tabulated below.
Materiality measure Purpose Basic and key considerations Quantum Financial Assessing whether the financial Based on 1.5% of an adjusted net asset 10,100,000 statement statements as a whole present value considering: materiality a true and fair view The nature of the investment portfolio and the level of judgement inherent in the valuation The expected level of gearing in the portfolio Specic Assessing those classes of 10% of profit before tax for the year 4,200,000 materiality transactions, balances or excluding unrealised valuation classes of disclosures for which movements transactions misstatements of lesser and balances amounts than materiality for which impact the financial statements as a on the realised whole could reasonably be return expected to inuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
It is appropriate to set financial statement materiality for the parent company and the other component at a lower level than Group materiality.
In light of the nature of the transactions and balances within each company, we have set materiality at 95% of Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Audit Committee all audit differences in excess of 200,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
