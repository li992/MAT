ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ALLIED MINDS PLC ONLY Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED We have audited the financial statements of Allied Minds plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 set out on pages 101 to 162.
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent Companys affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of the groups loss for the year then ended: the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU : the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: Disclosure of Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value $416.2 million, 2015: $535.8 million Risk vs FY15 Refer to page 92 Audit Committee Report and pages 135 to 137 financial disclosures The risk - The Group owns 33 subsidiaries in which it has ownership stakes of between 30.25% and 100%.
The results and financial position of the subsidiaries are consolidated in the group accounts.
Although the Groups holdings in subsidiaries are not included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value, the financial statements do include additional disclosure in relation to the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value of the subsidiaries, as the Directors have determined that it is appropriate to voluntarily present, as supplementary information.
The policy adopted by the Group is detailed in note 11.
The Groups subsidiaries are, for the most part, still at the development stage and the majority do not yet generate revenues.
This has therefore been determined to be a significant risk for our audit for the following reasons: as a result of the group policy not to formally revalue each subsidiary at each accounting period end there is significant judgement required to assess if there has been an indication of a decrease in the value of a subsidiary, therefore requiring a valuation: where there is a valuation driven by a DCF, the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting the trading of such companies and the significant level of judgement required to determine the assumptions used in the DCFs such as discount rate, revenue and EBIT forecasts and probability of success and the valuations are sensitive to changes in these assumptions: for valuations based on recent third party funding rounds, the relatively low number of investors partaking in funding rounds meaning that there is a risk that recent investment on which fair value is based are not sufficiently at arms length to ensure an independent market valuation representative of fair value and: the significance of the Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value disclosures in the group accounts to the users of the financial statements.
Our response - In this area our procedures included, 96 Financial Statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ALLIED MINDS PLC ONLY CONTINUED Where it had been determined that no formal valuation, will be prepared in the current year we assessed the appropriateness of this conclusion by critically assessing the performance of the related subsidiaries compared to prior year forecasts to identify indications of a decrease in the value of the company.
We challenged the explanations received for the variances in the context of the progression of the entity towards achieving milestones set and in relation to wider industry trends in the period.
Where valuations are based on the implied value from the most recent third party funding we assessed the accuracy of the data used including agreeing to share subscription agreements and shareholding structures as detailed in the capitalisation tables.
We evaluated the independence of the funding rounds on which the valuation was based by looking at the number of external investors included within the funding round, the significance of their investments and whether they are sufficiently independent from the Group to form a basis for the valuation.
Where valuations had been prepared by an external expert on behalf of the company we used our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used in the valuations.
We critically assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the forecasts, including assumptions over projected revenue including forecast product commercialisation or license date and royalty rates where applicable and operating costs and EBIT margin terminal values and the probability of success factors where applicable.
In doing this we used our knowledge of each subsidiary and its industry with reference to both internal management information and externally derived data and benchmarks, including market size data, royalty rates and competitor analyses based on information from public material.
We critically assessed the appropriateness of the discount rates applied, with specific focus on the company specific premium and the appropriateness of the probability of success, assessing also for consistency with the assumptions used in the prior year.
We also assessed whether the Group's disclosures were consistent with the valuations performed and whether the group's disclosures adequately highlighted the uncertainty inherent in the valuations.
Financial instruments preferred shares classification and valuation $140.9 million, 2015: $94.1 million Risk vs FY15 Refer to page 92 Audit Committee Report, pages 109 to 110 accounting policy and pages 141 to 145 and pages 147 to 148 financial disclosures The risk The Group finances its operations and subsidiaries partly through financial instruments such as preferred shares.
There is a significant level of judgement in determining whether the instruments should be classified as debt or equity and, when classified as debt, whether there are any embedded derivatives that require separation and would prevent the designation of the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss.
The fair value is derived using the option pricing model which involves a significant level of judgement around the key assumptions, such as subsidiary values either the implied value from a third party funding round, a valuation based on a DCF or asset based valuation see relevant sections in Disclosure of Group Subsidiary Ownership Adjusted Value, volatility, expected time to the conversion event, forecast exit dates and scenarios and applicable probability weighting.
Our response in this area our procedures included, : We critically assessed the conclusions reached by the Group in relation to the debt versus equity classification of the issued financial instruments by considering the key terms and features of the contracts through applying and interpreting relevant accounting standards: Where the Group designated the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss, we evaluated 97 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ALLIED MINDS PLC ONLY CONTINUED whether certain embedded derivatives required separate accounting by critically assessing the key terms and features of those derivatives.
The value of the subsidiary which is a key input into the option pricing model to give the value per share is either based on a third party funding round or on a DCF and therefore the procedures performed are detailed in our responses to the disclosure of group subsidiary ownership adjusted value.
We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in critically assessing other key inputs utilised within the option pricing model.
These key inputs were assessed for reasonableness by reference to externally derived data or internal data.
In the case of the volatility assumption, comparable company data is utilised and is critically assessed for appropriateness.
Internal data such as strategic plans, forecasts and budgets and actual results are utilised for inputs such as exit dates and scenarios and probability of exit scenarios where procedures performed include comparing to prior periods for consistency, understanding key changes and critically assessing current progress against milestones set and assessing where there is an impact on the forecast exit date and assessing whether the assumptions used are consistent with the strategic plans.
We assessed the assumptions used for consistency with the prior year and with assumptions used in the other portfolio companies and critically assessed variances as appropriate, understanding and challenging the variances based on our knowledge of the group: We also assessed whether the Groups disclosures were consistent with the conclusions reached in relation to both the classification of the financial instruments and in relation to the key assumptions related to the valuations.
In our audit report for the year ended 31 December 2015 we included Development Cost Capitalisation as one of the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit.
We continue to perform procedure over this risk, however, having gained a better understanding of the business and the products under development it has been determined that, given that the products being developed are a number of years from technical feasibility and also the fact that when technical feasibility and commercial viability are established there is then limited further spend on R&D we have not assessed this as one of the risk that had the greatest effect on our audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified in our report this year.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at $1 million 2015: $1 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of group total expenses, of $116 million 2015: $100 million, of which it represents 1% 2015: 1%, which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for the members of the company in assessing the financial performance of the Group, since the Groups activities are currently principally in relation to expenditure on developing forms of intellectual property which can be exploited commercially to generate income and growth in the future.
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $50 thousand 2015: $50 thousand, in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group's three 2015: two reporting components, we subjected three 2015: two to audits for group reporting purposes.
This covered 100% of total group revenue, group loss before tax, and total group assets.
The group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.
The group team approved the component materiality, which ranged from $200,000 to $900,000 2015: $150,000 to $500,000, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the components.
The work on two of the three components 2015: one of the two components was performed by component auditors and the rest by the group team.
