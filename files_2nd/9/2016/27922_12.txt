C1 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the members of The Paragon Group of Companies PLC only Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of The Paragon Group Companies PLC for the year ended 30 September 2016 set out in section D. In our opinion: The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 30 September 2016 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended The group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 2.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows: PAGE 174 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Independent Auditors Report 2016 Annual Report and Accounts INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT Revenue recognition for loans and advances 377.8 million Refer to section B4 Audit Committee Report, note 3 accounting policy and notes 5 and 13 critical accounting estimates and financial disclosures The risk The recognition of revenue interest receivable on loans and advances to customers under the effective interest rate EIR method requires the Directors to apply judgement, with the most critical being the estimation of a loans expected behavioural life for originated assets and estimated remaining collections ERCs for acquired loan portfolios.
The duration and profile of the collections are used in models to determine the rate at which to recognise interest and fee income, incentives and origination costs expected for each particular asset type.
The level of judgement required is illustrated by the sensitivity to changes in expected lives assumptions.
The Groups calculations are performed in Excel based models outside the core systems.
Given the nature and complexity of the models there is an increased risk of error or opportunity for fraud.
Originated assets The Group has segmented its portfolio of originated loans and advances in two ways - firstly by asset type and secondly by vintage.
Separate behavioural lives are estimated for each segment.
There is a risk that the choice of segmentation is inappropriate resulting in the estimation of an incorrect behavioural life.
The expected life assumptions utilise repayment profiles which represent how customers are expected to repay.
As the forecast profiles extend significantly into the future this creates a high level of estimation uncertainty and subjects the judgement to future market changes.
The Group makes its expected life assumptions based on its forecasting process which incorporates both historical experience and judgmental overlays made by management.
However, both of these have limitations.
The impact of recent developments in regulation and tax on buy-to-let products has increased the level of judgement required in the forecasting of behaviour for these products which represent 90% of the Group portfolio.
The Group also has less historical experience for its newer lending due to the relatively unseasoned nature of these portfolios.
Purchased loan portfolios For the Groups purchased debt portfolios the risk is that estimated future cash collections are not reflected by actual cash receipts.
Given the nature of the companys debt portfolios, estimation of future cash collections requires significant judgement to make assumptions about the value, probability and timing of expected future cash flows for each type of asset class within a portfolio.
Due to the level of subjectivity inherent in the assumptions used in the cash flow forecast, this is a key judgment area for our audit.
Our response - Our procedures included: Testing application controls, with the involvement of specialists, over the completeness and accuracy of data extraction into the models Agreeing to the Group reporting systems a sample of data inputs used to segment and estimate redemption profiles and calculate interest income Inspecting product literature to ensure that interest rate features, fees and costs were appropriately incorporated into the Groups models as required by the relevant accounting standards Performing sensitivity analysis to identify the most critical assumptions Challenging the appropriateness of key assumptions used in the models, including the expected lives and future cash flows, by comparing these to the Groups historical trends and actual portfolio behaviour, future outlook and our own expectations for comparable lending products For purchased debt portfolios, critically assessing the cash flow forecast with reference to our understanding of the Group and the current and past performance of the Groups portfolios, including recent cash collections: and Considering the adequacy of the Groups disclosures about the changes in estimate that occurred in the year and the sensitivity to changes in the key assumptions against the relevant requirements of accounting standards The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 175 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Independent Auditors Report INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT Interest payable on asset backed loan notes 103.4 million Refer to section B4 Audit Committee Report, note 3 accounting policy and notes 5 and 14 critical accounting estimates and financial disclosures The risk The recognition of interest payable on asset backed loan note liabilities under the effective interest rate EIR method requires the Directors to apply significant judgement in forecasting future cash flows, the most significant being the expected date of redemption.
Due to the significant carrying value of the loan notes, small changes in the expected redemption date or in the methodology used to recognise interest payable would have a significant effect on the Groups interest payable and the carrying amount of the liability.
Our response - Our procedures included: Inspection of the contractual terms of the loan notes to assess the completeness and accuracy of input data Assessing the methodology used to recognise interest over the expected life of the loan notes against our interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standards.
This included the consideration of alternative modelling by us, to assess whether the carrying value of the loan notes is appropriate Performing sensitivity analysis to assess the significance of assumptions Assessing the expected date of redemption by comparing it with historical experience of similar arrangements, the Groups three year plans and anticipated movements in market conditions which may affect the availability and attractiveness of alternative sources of funding: and Considering the adequacy of the Groups disclosures about the changes in estimate that occurred in the year and the sensitivity to changes in the key assumptions against the relevant requirements of accounting standards PAGE 176 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Independent Auditors Report 2016 Annual Report and Accounts INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT Impairment of loans and receivables 112.6 million Refer to section B4 Audit Committee Report, note 3 accounting policy and notes 5 and 36 critical accounting estimates and financial disclosures The risk The overall impairment provision recognised against loans and receivables does not appropriately provide for losses incurred at the reporting date.
The impairment provision relating to the Groups loan portfolios requires the Directors to make significant judgements and assumptions over the recoverability of loans and receivables.
Changes to these assumptions may significantly impact the required level of impairment provision.
For impairment purposes, the Group segments its portfolios along product lines to reflect the risk characteristics of each product type including buy-to-let mortgages, secured lending, car finance and finance leases.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual and collective basis and we consider the key assumptions and risks for each in turn.
Individual impairment A critical assumption is the appropriate identification of the impairment trigger.
The individual provision model uses arrears as the primary impairment trigger as well as whether the property is in receivership for buy-to-let property.
There is a risk that other impairment triggers are not identified on a timely basis.
The other key assumptions used in the calculation of the individual provision include the quantum and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans.
In the estimation of future cash flows, the Group considers past payment behaviour, the expected collections approach, including net rental income from the receiver of rent arrangement through its subsidiary Redbrick, and the likely collateral valuation.
Collective impairment For the purposes of the collective provision assessment, the Group calculates an emergence provision based on the previous loss experience for loans that have become individually impaired overlaid with management judgement.
There is a risk that the overall provision is not reflective of the incurred losses at the end of the period due to the period of time assumed that it takes for incurred losses to emerge, changes in customer credit quality or other market factors which are not sufficiently incorporated into the model such as the tax position of borrowers, changes in rental income on buy-to-let properties, and house prices.
Our response - Our procedures included: Testing the key controls over the acceptance, monitoring and reporting of credit risk Testing application controls, with the involvement of specialists, over the completeness and accuracy of data extraction into the models Validating the accuracy of the collective and individual impairment models by re-performing the calculations Assessing the methodologies used against our interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standards and our wider industry experience.
This included the consideration of alternative statistically based provisioning methodologies, to assess whether the current modelled provision is sufficient Challenging the appropriateness of the Groups key assumptions, including collateral valuations and forecast cash flows under a receivership of rent arrangement.
This is performed by reference to the Groups own historical experience, available benchmark data for similar asset classes at peer group organisations and a forward looking assessment of economic conditions Considering alternative impairment triggers and assessing whether these were sufficiently captured by the Groups models Performing sensitivity analysis over managements assumptions to identify those critical to the provision calculations: and Considering the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in relation to impairment including about the degree of sensitivity to key assumptions against the relevant requirements of accounting standards The Paragon Group of Companies PLC PAGE 177 2016 Annual Report and Accounts Independent Auditors Report INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT Retirement benefit obligation valuation 58.4 million Refer to section B4 Audit Committee Report, note 3 accounting policy and notes 5 and 56 critical accounting estimates and financial disclosures The risk Small changes in the assumptions and estimates used to value the Groups pension obligation before deducting scheme assets would have a significant effect on the Groups net pension deficit.
The level of judgement required in this estimation is highlighted by the level of sensitivity to changes in assumptions as shown by the increase in the deficit during the year.
Our response - Our procedures included: Challenging the key assumptions applied, being the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality life expectancy, with the support of our own actuarial specialists Comparison of these key assumptions against externally derived data Considering the adequacy of the Groups disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the deficit to these assumptions Recoverability of goodwill 98.4 million Refer to section B4 Audit Committee Report, note 3 accounting policy and notes 5 and 29 critical accounting estimates and financial disclosures The risk During the year the Group has made two acquisitions, Paragon Bank Asset Finance and Premier Asset Finance, upon which significant goodwill balances were recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The estimated recoverable amount calculated under a value in use approach is subjective due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash flows.
The Paragon Bank Asset Finance CGU represents the most significant singular element of the goodwill balance.
This business has undergone a period of transition under the Groups new ownership.
In calculating the recoverable amount, the directors made assumptions over certain key inputs including profitability growth, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.
There is a risk of recoverability of the associated goodwill due to changes in market factors since the acquisition and the risk of the CGU not achieving a successful transition.
Our response - Our procedures included: Assessing whether the CGUs have been appropriately identified in relation to the requirements of the accounting standards, with consideration of how directors monitor and manage the business Comparing the Groups assumptions to externally derived data as well as our own assessments in relation to key inputs such as projected economic growth and discount rates, as well as performing break-even analysis on the assumptions Challenging forecast cash flows and growth rates in the context of the historical experience of the CGU and management's plans for the business: and Assessing whether the Groups disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill PAGE 178 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Independent Auditors Report 2016 Annual Report and Accounts INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT 3.
