THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 35 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC ONLY Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016 set out on pages 38 to 54.
In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of the Companys affairs as at 31 March 2016 and of its profit for the year then ended: have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland: and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit is unchanged from 2015 and is as follows: Carrying amount of Quoted Investments 1,563 million 2015: 1,480 million Refer to page 20 Audit Committee Report, page 40 accounting policy and notes 9 and 16 financial disclosures.
The risk: The Companys portfolio of listed investments makes up 99% 2015: 97% of the Companys total assets by value and is considered to be the key driver of the Companys capital and revenue performance.
We do not consider these investments to be at high risk of significant misstatement, or to be subject to a significant level of judgement, because they comprise liquid, quoted investments.
However, due to their materiality in the context of the financial statements as a whole, they are considered to be the area which had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy and allocation of resources in planning and completing our audit.
Our response: Our procedures over the completeness, valuation and existence of the Companys portfolio of listed investments included, but were not limited to: documenting and assessing the processes in place to record investment transactions and to value the portfolio: agreeing the valuation of 100% of the investments to externally quoted prices: and agreeing 100% of the investment holdings to independently received third party confirmations.
Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit The materiality for the financial statements as a whole was set at 15.7 million 2015: 30.5 million determined with reference to a benchmark of the Total Assets figure of which it represents 1% 2015: 2% reflecting industry consensus levels.
In addition, we applied a materiality of 1.77 million 2015: 6.44 million to income from investments, excluding unrealised gains and losses, investment management fees and finance cost of borrowings for which we believe misstatements of lesser amounts than materiality for the financial statements as a whole could reasonably be expected to influence the Companys members assessment of the financial performance of the Company.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected and uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 0.79 million 2015: 1.52 million : any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 0.079 million 2015:0.32 million for the financial statement captions described above income from investments, excluding unrealised gains and losses, investment management fees and finance cost of borrowings : and, in addition, any other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Our audit of the Company was undertaken to the materiality level specified above and was performed at the Companys service providers Invesco Fund Managers Limited and Bank of New York Mellon Limited based in London.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified In our opinion: the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006: and the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors Report for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements.
We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: the Directors statement of longer-term viability on page 12, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors assessment and expectations of the Companys continuing in operation over the five years: or the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting.
We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception Under International Standards of Auditing UK and Ireland we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns: or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made: or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: the Directors statements, set out on pages 27 and 12 respectively in relation to going concern and longer-term viability: and the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 19 relating to the Companys compliance with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
