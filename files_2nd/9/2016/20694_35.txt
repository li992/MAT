142 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Independent auditors report to the members of Aldermore Group PLC only Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 1.
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Aldermore Group PLC for the year ended 31 December 2016 set out on pages 148 to 204.
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended: the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU : the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Overview The starting point for our audit was our experience as auditors of the Group since formation, including our assessment of the control environment and capital and liquidity positions, and we combined that with a consideration of external and internal developments and the risks they present to the Groups business model and how these risks are mitigated.
These were considered in June 2016, were refreshed following the results of the EU referendum and the half year review, and have been continually reassessed through our interim and final audits.
That consideration includes conversations not only with management and the Board, and ongoing knowledge gained through reading pertinent management information, but also reflected the views of the Prudential Regulatory Authority, market analysts, specialists within the firm, and peer comparisons.
We considered that the impact of regulatory change, the greater competition within some of the Groups markets impacting redemptions, the data migrations due to core system upgrades and the challenge of meeting market expectations would increase the audit risk in the area of income recognition.
We considered that the continued strong loan growth, the challenge of meeting market expectations, the regulatory and tax challenges to the Buy-to-Let market and the impact of the result of the EU referendum could all increase the audit risk in the area of loan impairment.
We note, however, that the risk continues to be mitigated through a lower interest rate environment and a relatively benign albeit uncertain credit outlook.
We considered that the audit risk in relation to goodwill has been substantially reduced, given that the Group have fully impaired the goodwill relating to the Invoice Finance Cash Generating Unit at the half year, due to a deterioration in the value of financial services companies following the result of the EU referendum.
Other factors we have considered in assessing the audit risks include the substantial project spend required in relation to systems projects, the emergence of digital and technological disrupters, increased regulation including the need to prepare for major financial reporting changes such as IFRS 9 and the Groups capital raising in October 2016.
The final result of our risk consideration is shown in the table, and we have shown those which have increased or decreased in risk.
We are of the view that there are seven areas of significant risk, but two income recognition and credit risk represent the greatest significance.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows: Income Recognition: Effective Interest Rate asset of 34.8 million and offsetting liability of 31.5 million 2015: 23.9 million and 21.5 million respectively Refer to page 65 Audit Committee Report, page 156 accounting policy, page 168 Use of estimates and judgements and Note 5 financial disclosures The Risk Measuring interest income on loans and advances to customers under the effective interest rate method Note 2 a requires the Directors to apply judgements, with the most critical being the expected life assumption.
The Group has a number of portfolios including organic and acquired loans across a variety of sectors and products which results in a large number of expected life assumptions.
The sensitivity to a change in expected life can vary greatly over the portfolios depending on the underlying borrower and the other parameters also included in the effective interest rate calculation such as reversionary interest rates at the end of the fixed term, transaction costs and discounts or premium in place at inception.
The expected life assumptions utilise repayment profiles which represent how customers are expected to repay.
The Group has limited historical experience to support these profiles due to the relatively unseasoned nature of its lending.
Consequently, the Group makes its expected life assumptions based on its forecasting process which takes into account historical data but also, for the forecast period, the Groups expertise and experience in the sector.
As such, any change in the expected life assumptions depend on the Directors assessment of whether there is any emerging experience or market information that indicates a different repayment profile and by how much.
As the forecast profiles extend significantly into the future this creates a high level of estimation uncertainty.
Low Impact High 144 Aldermore Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Financial statements Independent auditors report to the members of Aldermore Group PLC only continued This has the greatest impact on the acquired loan portfolios current balance: 113.4 million because these were acquired at an upfront discount unamortised balance: 7.0 million and repayments are linked to the bank base rate with minimal incentive for the borrowers to remortgage until there is a change in interest rate expectations.
This means any change in the repayment profile causes the discount received on purchase of the acquired portfolios to be adjusted and spread over the revised expected life.
In addition, repayment profiles will be affected by future changes in the market for example, market pricing and the ability of borrowers to remortgage The models used to measure revenue recognition rely on manual processes and controls which increase the risk associated with model stability and the completeness and accuracy of input data.
Our response our audit procedures included: We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the completeness and accuracy of model inputs and the reconciliation of model outputs to the financial statements: We performed a reconciliation of data inputs used to measure interest income, including the loans split by product type, to reports from the Group reporting system: We tested application controls, with the involvement of our IT specialists, over the completeness and accuracy of the source loan input reports: We assessed the accuracy of the models by re-performing a sample of calculations and comparing the methodology used to our interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standard: We tested the stability and integrity of the models with the involvement of our IT specialists: We challenged the appropriateness of key assumptions, including the expected lives and repayment profiles, by comparing these to the available historical customer trends within the Group, internal forecasts, and to our own expectations based on our knowledge of the Group and experience of the industry in which it operates, including the ability of customers to remortgage based on the current offerings in the market: For comparable lending and where available, we benchmarked the Groups expected life assumptions to peer data and or market information: and We also considered the adequacy of the Groups disclosures about the changes in estimate that occurred during the period and the sensitivity disclosures across the key loan books.
Credit Risk: Impairment of loans and advances to customers 15.5 million 2015: 10.4 million Refer to page 64 Audit Committee Report, page 160 accounting policy, page 166 Use of estimates and judgements and Note 22 financial disclosures The Risk The impairment provision relating to the Groups loan portfolios requires the Directors to make significant judgements and assumptions over the recoverability of loan balances.
The Group performs an assessment of its loans for impairment as described in Note 2 g. The loan provision is most sensitive to assumptions made when assessing the collective provision, in particular in respect of the probability of default and the emergence period.
This is because the Group has limited historical experience to support the assumptions made due to the relatively unseasoned nature of its loan portfolios underwritten during a relatively benign economic period.
To assess the probability of default, the Group uses a credit bureau to provide it with probabilities of default based on all available credit data for comparable borrowers.
These probabilities are then adjusted in almost all cases downwards to reflect the Groups actual borrowers and the nature of its lending.
The adjustments scalars are based on the Groups internal data, which would not have been taken into account by the credit bureau.
Management also apply overlays to the resultant modelled results to take into account both model risk and emerging risks that may not be otherwise appropriately factored in by the credit bureau.
145 Strategic report Corporate governance Risk management Financial statements Appendices The emergence period is assessed based on loans for which the Group is able to reliably measure the time between the trigger event occurring and the loans being identified as impaired.
As the Group has limited historical data available, particularly in Asset Finance, the estimated emergence period is adjusted upwards in the form of an overlay and is based on market insight.
The Groups individual provisions can also require judgement, particularly in SME Commercial Mortgages and Asset Finance, where the valuation of collateral can be difficult to establish due to its specialised nature: as well as the exit strategy adopted, which can significantly impact the timing and value of the cash flows.
There continues to be regulatory focus on lending institutions factoring of forbearance arrangements adequately into their provisioning models.
The impact of the EU referendum result has also been assessed in regards to the potential impairment of collateral prices, uncertainties surrounding the House Price Index and potential increase in emergence periods as property markets have the potential of a slow down due to increased volatility in the funding markets.
Our response - our audit procedures included: We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the capture, monitoring and reporting of loans and advances to customers: We assessed the accuracy of the impairment model for collectively assessed loans, with assistance from our IT specialists, by re-performing a sample of calculations produced by the impairment model and compared the methodology used to our interpretation of the requirements of the relevant accounting standards: For loans assessed collectively for impairment we: assessed the competency, reputation and objectivity of the credit bureau that provides the probabilities of default: critically assessed the assumptions made in respect of the probabilities of default inclusive of the scalars and the emergence periods against our understanding of the Group as well as our knowledge of the wider market: assessed the reasonableness of the methodology and accuracy of loss given default models: assessed the consistency of the probabilities of default inclusive of the scalars and the emergence periods with the limited historic internal data available: assessed and challenged management overlays within the model for completeness and accuracy: and assessed the accuracy of previous estimates of the collective provision.
For a sample of exposures that were subject to an individual impairment assessment, and focusing on those with the most significant potential impact on the financial statements, we specifically challenged the Groups assumptions on the expected future cash flows, including the value of realisable collateral, based on our own understanding of the industry and reviewing latest correspondence on the loan and third party valuations or property indexes: Challenged managements assessment of identified cases of concern with material exposure: We assessed the performing loan book by using data analytics techniques to identify loans with characteristics that could indicate unidentified impairment: We benchmarked the Groups key metrics, such as arrears trends and provision coverage, to externally available data, with particular focus on similar lending: and We also considered compliance with the relevant accounting standards including the adequacy of the Group disclosures in relation to impairment.
