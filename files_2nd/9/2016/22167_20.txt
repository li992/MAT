Independent Auditors Report to the Members of Card Factory plc Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit.
1 OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS UNMODIFIED We have audited the financial statements of Card Factory plc for the year ended 31 January 2016 set out on pages 78 to 118.
In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the Parent Companys affairs as at 31 January 2016 and of the Groups profit for the year then ended: the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU : the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit are listed below in decreasing order of significance.
Inventory 50.4m FY15: 41.5m, Risk vs FY15 Refer to page 46 Audit and Risk Committee Report, page 89 accounting policy and page 96 financial disclosures.
The risk: Due to the nature of the business there is a high volume of items held in inventory.
Elements of the costing calculations for both store and warehouse stock are manual in nature as are certain controls around store inventory.
These controls include stock counts and review of stock levels by store.
Due to the significant volume of stock items and the broad product range there is a risk that a material misstatement could arise due to the volume of store stock or cost of inventory being incorrectly recorded.
Our response: In this area, our procedures included: attendance at a sample of store inventory counts to assess the design, implementation and homogeneity of the store stock count procedures.
A sample of stock quantities submitted by stores as part of the store inventory counts were agreed to the Directors stock listing.
We also attended the warehouse inventory count for a sample of inventory lines to test the operating effectiveness of the warehouse stock count control and whether the quantities were stated correctly: reconciliation of total stock by comparing the results of store and warehouse counts adjusted for provisioning and other stock related adjustments to the accounting values booked for store and warehouse stock adjusted for shrinkage.
We recalculated and sought supporting documentation for each of these inputs and critically assessed the Directors assumptions around shrinkage percentages to ensure that the basis of calculation was appropriate: comparing the actual store stock levels, on a store by store basis, to our expectations, based on our understanding of the business, taking into consideration store size and the nature of the inventory.
Where we found the level of stock was not in line with our expectations we evaluated the characteristics specific to the store to assess whether this supported the stock level held: review of sales immediately pre and post year end to assess whether there had been significant fluctuations which would indicate an issue over stores stock existence: testing over a sample of inventory lines to assess whether all elements of the costs attributed to them had been accurately input into the costing calculations: testing the cost inputs by obtaining supporting documentation and re-performing standard cost calculations: and assessing whether the disclosures in relation to inventory were appropriate.
74 Card Factory plc Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Strategic report Governance Financials Foreign exchange hedging, Risk vs FY15 Refer to page 46 Audit and Risk Committee Report, pages 86 to 88 accounting policy and page 103 financial disclosures.
The risk: The Group commercially hedges a high proportion of foreign currency stock purchases.
A combination of instruments are used, primarily foreign exchange forwards and forward contracts with embedded options.
Where appropriate, hedge accounting is adopted by the Group.
Due to the degree of judgement and estimation in determining forecast cash flows there is a risk that the assumptions made in the prospective effectiveness testing are inappropriate, which would lead to the presentation of the fair value movement on the financial instruments in equity being incorrect.
Our response: In this area, our procedures included: assessing whether the controls in place around foreign exchange hedging are sufficient, appropriate and operate effectively by assessing whether effectiveness testing has been carried out prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis: agreeing all existing foreign exchange forward contracts at the year end to the hedge documentation prepared at the inception of the contract and assessing whether the criteria for hedge accounting has been met: obtaining and considering the Directors assessment of prospective and retrospective hedge effectiveness for the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at the year end and reperforming the calculation at the year end to assess their accuracy: assessing the historical accuracy of forecast foreign currency purchases to assess the reliability of the Groups forecasting: evaluating whether the ineffective portion of the hedges have been charged to the income statement in line with accounting policies: agreeing the mark to market value of the forward contract to third-party confirmation for all contracts outstanding at the year end and recalculating a sample of mark to market valuations, assisted by our own valuation specialist: and assessing the adequacy of the financial instrument disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit report for the year ended 31 January 2015 we included IPO accounting and disclosures as one of the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit.
We considered this risk not to be significant in the current year as this related to the 2014 listing of the Group on the London Stock Exchange and was therefore a one-off occurrence.
3 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole has been set at 4.0m determined by reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, normalised to exclude non-recurring items of 1.7m as disclosed in note 3 on page 90, of 82.0m of which it represents 5%.
We report to the Audit and Risk Committee any corrected and uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 50,000 in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Groups three reporting components we subjected one to an audit for Group reporting purposes.
The other two were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for Group reporting purposes and neither presented with specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.
On those two components we conducted reviews of financial information including enquiry which provided further coverage of the Groups results.
These procedures covered 100% of total Group revenue: 100% of Group profit before taxation and 100% of total Group assets.
