Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2009 07 Last year the commodity markets in which we operate yielded weak margins for coal-fired generators.
Despite poor market conditions we have delivered earnings marginally Commodity markets above expectations.
Power prices are driven by a number of factors, but the dominant force in 2009 was low gas prices as a result of the weak global economy.
reducing global demand has led to a gas surplus, and with storage for only a finite volume, the UK with its open market has become a significant consumer of last resort.
Plentiful supply into the UK has consequently driven gas prices down and with them power prices.
The coal market was comparatively unaffected by the recession as higher demand in China and India counteracted the reduced demand in europe and the United States.
In addition, good availability of UK generating capacity, as well as around a 3% reduction in electricity demand compared to a year ago, has put further pressure on power prices and as a result we have seen narrowing dark green spreads.
Trading performance Despite challenging market conditions in the near-term, our exposure to these narrowing spreads is mitigated by our strong forward contracted position.
In the first half of 2009, forward commodity prices for 2010 and beyond traded on the basis of a strong recovery in dark green spreads in 2010 through to 2012.
Amidst concerns that the market fundamentals were not supporting the forward spreads, we accelerated our 2010, 2011 and 2012 forward sales locking in improved spreads at levels above our average spreads for 2009.
This provided us with a very robust hedge for 2010 and an improved hedge in 2011 and 2012.
We also executed an additional power sales agreement with Centrica for the five years to September 2015.
Under this new agreement we will provide Centrica with 300MW of baseload power.
The pricing under the agreement provides us with fixed dark green spreads consistent with our trading strategy.
The acquisition of haven in March supported our strategy to extend our trading capabilities and options for routes to market.
This customer focused supply business has proved to be an excellent fit with our existing trading activities providing a market for the electricity that we generate through securing term contracts with customers.
haven, with its main customer base of small and medium sized enterprises, supplied 0.7TWh in 2009.
We expect over the next few years to increase significantly havens supplies to this segment of the electricity supply market.
We have also started to explore direct sales through haven to the industrial and commercial market and commenced sales to a few of the larger business customers in the final quarter of 2009.
This segment of the market collectively consumes around 150TWh each year and sales to this sector could lead to rapid growth in our use of haven as a direct route to market.
During 2010, we will take forward our initiative to expand significantly our sales to this market segment.

in mainland europe, gas prices are linked under contract to oil prices, Transmission and given that the uK imports a significant amount of gas and national grid operates the pylons and wires that gas is used to generate around 45% of the uK electricity, for transmitting electricity at high voltages any changes in wholesale gas prices will impact wholesale electricity prices.
Electricity distribution businesses low gas prices were a feature of the market during 2009, companies who operate the low voltage which in turn led to low wholesale power prices.
The wholesale regional electricity distribution networks market operates on price and with gas-fired generation becoming cheaper, coal-fired generation became the marginal plant.

During 2009, we have continued to experience challenging market conditions for coal-fired generators, with further falls in power prices driving a further contraction in spreads.

Damien Speight head Trader These trends have continued in 2009.
The global gas market has been the dominant factor in driving uK power prices down further.
reducing demand has led to a global gas surplus, and, with storage for only a finite volume, the uK with its open market has become the consumer of last resort.
plentiful supply has consequently driven gas prices down and power prices on the back of those.
in addition, high availability of uK generating capacity as well as a reduction of more than 3% in electricity demand compared to a year ago, caused by the economic downturn, have put further pressure on power prices.

however, spot coal prices fell significantly over the final quarter, down to us$81 per tonne by 31 December 2008, as supply constraints eased in both the coal and freight markets.
The fall in coal prices was partially offset by the depreciation of sterling against the us dollar through the second half of 2008. prices have remained fairly stable during 2009.
There is downward pressure in the near-term, with spot prices returning to us$81 per tonne at 31 December 2009, resulting from recession induced weaker demand causing over supply and higher stock levels, particularly in europe.

introduction The groups principal performance indicators are highlighted on pages 20 and 21. ebiTDA was 355 million for the year ended 31 December 2009 compared to 454 million in 2008, reflecting a decrease in the margins captured for power delivered in 2009. commodity market conditions were generally challenging for Drax last year, with falling power prices resulting in narrowing dark green spreads.
we accelerated our hedging for 2010, locking in higher average margins than for 2009 on our output sold to date.
we have also executed an additional 300mw baseload power sales agreement with centrica for the five years to september 2015, which provides us with fixed dark green spreads consistent with our trading strategy and signals the willingness of counterparties to contract beyond 2012.
The acquisition of haven extends our trading capabilities and options for routes to market.
we have also exceeded the cost reduction and cash management targets we set ourselves early in 2009, and have taken significant steps to strengthen our capital structure through the successful completion of a share placing and the refinancing of our outstanding term loan.
This review includes further explanation and commentary in relation to our principal performance indicators and the results for the year.
