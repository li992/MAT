As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate profit and loss account has been presented for the Company.
The Company has not presented a cash flow statement or provided details of related party transactions as permitted under FRS 1 revised Cash flow statements and FRS 8 Related party disclosures respectively.
As permitted by FRS 29, the Company has elected not to present FRS 29 Financial instruments: disclosures in the notes to its individual financial statements as full equivalent disclosures are presented in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Investments Held as Fixed Assets Investments held as fixed assets comprise the Companys investment in subsidiaries and are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Dividends Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders, while interim dividends are recognised in the period in which the dividends are paid.
Financial Instruments Non-derivative financial assets are classified as debtors including cash.
Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For interest-bearing assets, the carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.

This amounts to 527 million based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2009.
At the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
The dividend per share figures included in the table above reflect the bonus element of the rights issue as described in note 20 of the consolidated financial statements.

At 30 September 2009, the contingent liability totalled 11,464 million 2008: 11,161 million.
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file separate financial statements with the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liabilities for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2009.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited, John Player Distributors Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar have therefore availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies Amendment Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.
The Directors have assessed the fair value of the above guarantees and do not consider them to be material.
They have therefore not been recognised on the balance sheet.

Directors emoluments Details of Directors emoluments and interests are provided within the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 70.
