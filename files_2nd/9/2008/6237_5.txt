2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2008, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006, where relevant.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The Company became the holding company for the Group pursuant to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation completed 18 April 2008, as detailed in Note 1.
As this was a reorganisation of businesses under common control, the pooling of interests method of accounting has been applied in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 which presents the results of the Groups businesses as if the Company had always been the holding company.
For periods prior to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation, consolidated financial statements were not prepared for the Group.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the results and changes in equity of the Company and its subsidiaries as if the Group had been in existence throughout the periods presented and as if the Pre-IPO Reorganisation had occurred as at 1 January 2007.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 are set out below.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain classes of property, plant and equipment that have been stated at deemed cost under IFRS 1, derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial instruments and dened benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.
78 FINANCIALS The Groups transition date to IFRS was 1 January 2007.
The rules for first-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards.
IFRS 1 allows certain exemptions in the application of particular Standards to prior periods in order to assist companies with the transition process.
The Group has applied the following exemptions: i Certain classes of property, plant and equipment had been revalued at 1 January 2005.
Deemed cost at the date of transition is determined by reference to the revaluation as of 1 January 2005 that was performed at the time of the initial public offering of the Group, adjusted for depreciation for the period until the date of transition and ii The cumulative translation differences for foreign operations have been deemed to be zero at the date of transition: any gains or losses or subsequent disposals of foreign operations will not therefore include translation differences arising prior to the transition date.
Reconciliations to the previous GAAP for equity as at the date of transition and the profit and loss account for previous periods are not presented as the Group has not previously reported consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial information is presented in US dollars $ and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand $000 except when otherwise indicated.
b Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods but which the Group has not adopted early.
Those that are applicable to the Group are as follows: IFRS 8 Operating Segments is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
This standard introduces the management approach to segment reporting.
IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial information, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
The adoption of this standard will not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Group but is expected to give rise to additional disclosures.
IAS 23 Amendment, Borrowing Costs revised in March 2007, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 23 Revised have removed the option of immediately recognising as an expense borrowing costs that relate to assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
An entity is, therefore, required to capitalise borrowing costs as part of the cost of such assets.
The revised standard applies to borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
Management does not expect this amendment to impact the Group, as the Groups current policy is to capitalise borrowing costs on qualifying assets.
IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations and IAS 27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, issued in January 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRS 3R introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date and will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs, and future reported results.
IAS 27R requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Therefore, such transactions will no longer give rise to goodwill, nor will it give rise to gain or loss.
Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by partially-owned subsidiaries as well as the loss of control of a subsidiary.
Other consequential amendments were made to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, IAS 12 Income Taxes, IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, IAS 28 Investment in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
The changes to IFRS 3R and IAS 27R will affect future acquisitions or loss of control and transactions with minority interests.
The standards may be early applied.
However, the Company does not intend to take advantage of this possibility.
IAS 1 Revised Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in September 2007 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The Standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity.
The statement of changes in equity will include only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented as a single line.
In addition, the Standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single statement, or in two linked statements.
The Company is still evaluating whether it will have one or two statements.
The Group anticipates adopting each of these standards, interpretations and amendments from their respective effective dates.
Those new standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not applicable to the Group are as follows: IFRS 2 Amendment Share-based Payment, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, claries that only service conditions and performance conditions are vesting conditions, and other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
In addition, it species that all cancellations, whether by the entity or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment.
Management does not expect this amendment to impact the Group.
IAS 32 Amendment Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation, both effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, require entities to classify as equity certain financial instruments provided certain criteria are met.
The instruments to be classied as equity are puttable financial instruments and those instruments that impose an obligation on the entity to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1, 2008.
IFRIC 13 addresses accounting by entities that operate or otherwise participate in customer loyalty programmes for their customers.
IFRIC 13 applies to sales transactions in which the entities grant their customers award credits that, subject to meeting any further qualifying conditions, the customers can redeem in the future for free or discounted goods or services.
The interpretation requires that an entity recognises credits that it awards to customers as a separately identiable component of revenue, which would be deferred at the date of the initial sale.
IFRIC 13 will become mandatory for the Groups consolidated financial statements beginning April 1, 2009 with earlier application permitted.
IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement Eligible Hedged Items, issued in August 2008 and become effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The amendment addresses the designation of a one-sided risk in a hedged item, and the designation of ination as a hedged risk or portion in particular situations.
It claries that an entity is permitted to designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash ow variability of a financial instrument as a hedged item.
The Group has concluded that the amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
2008 ANNUAL REPORT 79 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IFRIC 15 Agreement for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 15 was issued in July 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The interpretation is to be applied retrospectively.
It claries when and how revenue and related expenses from the sale of a real state unit should be recognised if an agreement between a developer and buyer is reached before the construction of the real estate is completed.
Furthermore, the interpretation provides guidance on how to determine whether an agreement is within the scope of IAS 11 or IAS 18.
IFRIC 15 will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statement because the Group does not conduct such activity.
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation, issued in July 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2008.
The interpretation is to be applied prospectively.
IFRIC 16 provides guidance on the accounting for a hedge of a net investment.
As such it provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify for hedge accounting in the hedge of a net investment, where within the group the hedging instruments can be held in the hedge of a net investment and how an entity should determine the amount of foreign currency gain or loss, relating to both the net investment and the hedging instrument, to be recycled on the disposal of the net investment.
IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners, issued in November 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 17 claries that a dividend payable should be recognised when the dividend is appropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity.
It also claries that an entity should measure the dividend payable at the fair value of the net assets to be distributed and that an entity should recognise the difference between the dividend paid and the carrying amount of the net assets distributed in profit or loss.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, The amendments to IFRS 1 allows an entity to determine the costof investment in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities or associates in its opening IFRS financial statements in accordance with IAS 27 or using a deemed cost.
The amendment to IAS requires all dividends from subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate to be recognised in the income statement.
Both revisions will be effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The revision to IAS 27 will have to be applied prospectively.
The new requirements affect only the parents separate financial statement and do not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
c significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions Many of the amounts included in the consolidated financial information involve the use of judgement and or estimation.
These judgements and estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial information.
Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and or the notes to the consolidated financial information.
Judgements Areas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial information are: Determination of functional currencies note 2 e The determination of functional currency requires management judgment, particularly where there may be several currencies in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates.
Estimates and assumptions significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial information include: Determination of useful lives of assets for depreciation and amortisation purposes note 2 f and note 13.
Estimates are required to be made by management as to the useful lives of assets.
For depreciation calculated under the unit-of production method, estimated recoverable reserves are used in determining the depreciation and or amortisation of mine specic assets.
This results in a depreciation amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine production.
Each items life, which is assessed annually, has regard to both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the asset is located.
These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves.
Changes are accounted for prospectively.
Determination of ore reserves note 2 g : Ore reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Groups mining properties.
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualied persons relating to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the ore body, and requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data.
The estimation of recoverable reserves is based upon factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, future capital requirements, and production costs along with geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body.
Changes in the reserve or resource estimates may impact upon the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant & equipment, goodwill, provision for rehabilitation, recognition of deferred tax assets, and depreciation and amortisation charges.
Impairment of assets note 2 h : The Group assesses each cash generating unit annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
These assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
Fair value for mineral assets is generally determined as the present value of estimated future cash ows arising from the continued use of the asset, which includes estimates such as the cost of future expansion plans and eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account.
Cash ows are discounted by an appropriate discount rate to determine the net present value.
Management has assessed its cash generating units as being an individual mine site, which is the lowest level for which cash ows are largely independent of other assets.
80 FINANCIALS Impairment of available-for-sale assets note 2 j and 14: The Company classies certain financial assets as available-for-sale and recognises movements in their fair value in equity.
When the fair value declines, management makes assumptions about the decline in value to determine whether it is an impairment that should be recognised in profit or loss.
At 31 December 2008 impairment losses of $4.9m have been recognised relating to the available-for-sale assets 2007: US$nil : Estimation of the amount and timing of mine closure costs notes 2 m and 22 The consolidated entity assesses its mine rehabilitation provision annually.
significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine rehabilitation as there are numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable.
These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, and changes in discount rates.
Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.
The provision at balance date represents managements best estimate of the present value of the future rehabilitation costs required.
Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the rehabilitation asset and liability.
If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of rehabilitation provisions exceeds the carrying value, that portion of the increase is charged directly to expense.
For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Pension and post-employment benefit valuation assumptions notes 2 o and 23: For dened benefit schemes, management is required to make assumptions regarding the future returns on plan assets, future remuneration structures, employee turnover, ination rates and exchange rates.
Changes to these assumptions may change the accounting treatment and the amounts charged to the income statement.
Income tax notes 2 v and 11: Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet.
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.
Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash ows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.
To the extent that future cash ows and taxable income differ signicantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.
Silverstream The valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires significant estimation by management.
The derivative has a term of over 20 years and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the reserves and resources and future production prole of the Sabinas mine, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash ows.
The fair value of this contract is $318.0 million as at 31 December 2008 and changes in these assumptions may change this value.
For further detail of this arrangement, see note 15.
The impact of changes in silver price assumptions and the discount rate is included in note 32.
Valuation of derivative financial instruments notes 2 x and 31: Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies applicable to the specic type of derivative instrument: and Contingent liabilities regarding claims from tax authorities note 27 b By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur.
The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events.
d Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as of 31 December 2008, and operations and cash ows for the year then ended.
Entities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the amount of shares owned by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The consolidated financial information of the entities that constitute the Group has been prepared for the years ended 31 December 2008 and 2007 using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit and loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented in the income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from amounts attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group.
These interests primarily represent the interests in Minera Penmont, S. fide R. L. fide C. V. Minera El Bermejal, S. fide R. L. fide C. V. and Minera Juanicipio, S. A. fide C. V. not held by the Group.
In the event of a purchase of minority shareholders interest when the Group holds the majority of shares of a subsidiary, any excess over the Groups share of net assets is recorded in retained earnings in equity.
e Foreign currency translation The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the parent companys functional currency.
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For all operating entities, this is US dollars.
During the year the functional currency of the parent company changed to US dollars as a result of changes in the transactions undertaken by the parent company following the IPO.
2008 ANNUAL REPORT 81 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.
For entities with functional currencies other than US dollars, as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in equity.
On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value.
Cost comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
For certain assets, the cost or deemed cost of property, plant and equipment hereafter referred to as cost at 1 January 2007, the date of the Groups transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to the revalued amounts as at 1 January 2005, as prepared for the purposes of the initial public offering of the Group, then depreciated for the period until the date of the transition.
Economical and physical conditions of these assets had not changed substantially over this period.
The cost less its residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit of production UOP basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mining production process or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset when not related to the mining production process.
Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences when assets are available for use.
The expected useful lives are as follows: Years Buildings 5-12 Plant and equipment 4-11 Mining concessions and mine development costs 3-9 Other assets 2-7 An item of property, plant and equipment is fide-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benets are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising at fide-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is fide-recognised.
Non-current assets or disposal groups are classied as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use.
Assets are not depreciated when classied as held for sale.
Disposal of assets Gains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.
Mineral properties and mine development costs Payments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred.
Purchased mineral reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.
Mining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of time in which benets are expected to be obtained from that specic concession.
Expenditure on mine development is capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment.
Mine development activities commence once commercial reserves are identied and the relevant project is sanctioned.
Upon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit of production method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.
Construction in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
82 FINANCIALS Subsequent expenditures All subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised.
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditures are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Stripping costs In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste in order to access the ore body.
During development and pre-production phases, these costs are capitalised as part of the initial mine investment and they are depreciated based on the mines production once commercial operations begin.
Removal of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a mine.
This activity is referred to as production stripping and commences at the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the mine.
The costs of production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs.
Further development of a mine may occur following initial extraction of saleable material and during the production phase.
Stripping costs associated with such development activities are capitalised and depreciated based on the related production.
g Determination of ore reserves The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by internal competent persons in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee JORC code.
Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year.
An independent competent person has veried the reasonableness of these reports as at 31 December 2008.
Reserves are used in the unit of production calculation for depreciation, the determination of the timing of mine closure and for determining value in use for any impairment analysis.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves.
Assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change signicantly when new information becomes available.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, ultimately, result in the reserves being restated.
h Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash ows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Fair value is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arms length basis.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate cash inows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The Groups cash generating units are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other assets or groups of assets.
Reversal of impairment An assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years.
Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.
i Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classied as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to maturity investments: or as available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Group determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
2008 ANNUAL REPORT 83 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classied as held for trading and other assets designated as such on inception are included in this category.
Financial assets are classied as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term.
Derivatives are also classied as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
After initial measurement such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.
Gains and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Current trade receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such or are not classied in any of the preceding categories and are not held-to-maturity investments.
Available-for-sale financial assets represent investments that have a quoted market price in an active market, therefore a fair value can be reliably measured.
After initial measurement, available for sale assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity.
Fair value In determining estimated fair value, investments in shares or portfolios of listed securities are valued at quoted bid prices.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available and for listed non-actively traded securities, fair value is determined using a valuation technique.
Valuation techniques include using a recent arms length transaction, if available, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis and option pricing models.
If the range of reasonable fair value is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reliably assessed, the investment is not re-measured at fair value.
j Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows excluding future expected credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account.
The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment.
Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred from equity to the income statement.
In assessing whether there is an impairment, the Group considers whether a decline in fair value is either significant or prolonged, by considering the size of the decline in this value and the historic volatility in changes in fair value.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classied as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the income statement if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement.
84 FINANCIALS k Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method.
The cost of work in progress and nished goods ore inventories is based on cost of production and excludes borrowing costs.
For this purpose, the costs of production include: personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore: the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore: and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
l Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value.
Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.
For the purposes of the cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents as dened above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Mine closure cost A provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
Other Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an outow of resources for which the amount can be reliably estimated.
n Financial liabilities The Group recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, including any transaction costs incurred.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
o Employee benets The Group operates the following plans: Dened benefit pension plan This funded plan is based on each employees earnings and years of service.
This plan was open to all employees in Mexico and it is denominated in Mexican Pesos.
This plan was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007.
For members as at 30 June 2007, benets were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index NCPI.
The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial rm as at each year end balance sheet date.
The discount rate is the yield on mxAAA Standard & Poors and AAA-mex Fitch Ibca 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 85 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benets are expected to be paid.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
If the benets have already vested following the introduction of, or changes to, a pension plan, the past service cost is recognised immediately.
The dened benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the dened benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benets available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.
Dened contribution pension plan A dened contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays xed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due.
The contributions are based on the employees salary.
This plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.
Seniority premium for voluntary separation This unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service.
Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service.
For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.
The cost of providing benets for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an independent actuarial rm as at each year end balance sheet date.
Other Benets for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.
Termination payments for involuntary retirement dismissals are charged to the income statement, when incurred.
p Employee profit sharing In accordance with local legislation, companies in Mexico must provide for employee profit sharing equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income of each year.
This amount is charged to the income statement and is considered deductible for income tax purposes.
q Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date including whether the fullment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specic asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies: a.
There is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement: b.
A renewal option is exercised or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term: c. There is a change in the determination of whether fullment is dependent on a specified asset: or d. There is a substantial change to the asset.
Group as a lessee Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benets incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are reected in the income statement.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benets of ownership of the asset are classied as operating leases.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income.
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
86 FINANCIALS Where a reassessment is made, lease accounting commences or ceases from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios a, c or d and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario b above.
For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be 1 January 2007, in accordance with the transitional requirements of IFRIC 4. r Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated financial information and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial information, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable.
s Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.
Sale of goods Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.
Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
The Group recognises revenue on a provisional basis at the time concentrates, precipitates and dor bars are delivered to the customers smelter or renery, using the Groups best estimate of contained metal.
Revenue is subject to adjustment once the analysis of the product samples is completed, contract conditions have been fullled and final settlement terms are agreed.
Any subsequent adjustments to the initial estimate of metal content are recorded in revenue once they have been determined.
In addition, sales of concentrates and precipitates throughout each calendar month, as well as dor bars that are delivered after the 20th day of each month, are provisionally priced subject to a final adjustment based on the average price for the month following the delivery to the customer, based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract.
Dor bars that are delivered in the first 20 days of each month are nally priced in the month of delivery.
For sales of goods that are subject to provisional pricing, revenue is initially recognised when the conditions set out above have been met using the provisional price.
The price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and hence separated from the sales contract.
At each reporting date the provisionally priced metal is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotation period ends.
The selling price of the metals can be reliably measured as these are actively traded on international exchanges.
The revaluing of provisionally priced contracts is recorded as an adjustment to revenue.
Royalties Income derived from royalties is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received.
Currently the Group receives royalties based on a percentage of the sales of concentrates from the El Cedro, Peregrina and Sirena small scale mines rented to a third party.
Rental income Rental income arising from operating leases on a small scale mine rented to a third party is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Interest income Interest income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method: i. e. the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment is established.
t Exploration expenses Exploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identied resource.
Exploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: i Cost of salescosts relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life, and ii Exploration expenses: a.
Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves, and b.
Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identied by project.
These exploration expenses, which include exploratory drilling, sample testing and pre-feasibility studies, are charged to the income statement until the mineral reserves of that specic project are economically recoverable.
2008 ANNUAL REPORT 87 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS u Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested and gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments.
Interest income and costs are recognised as accrued, taking into account the effective yield on the asset or liability.
v Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except: i where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except: i where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
w Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
x Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in prices of base metals and foreign exchange which impact its financial and business transactions.
Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
88 FINANCIALS Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value applicable to the specic type of derivative instrument.
The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The Silverstream contract is valued using a net present value valuation approach.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for the undertaken hedge.
The documentation includes identication of the hedging instrument, the hedge item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will asses the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash ows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash ows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Cash ow hedges For derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as a component of equity and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
For gains and losses related to the hedging of revenues, these are included as part of revenues and for those related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reected.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash ow hedges is recognised in the income statement of the related period.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in equity from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that signicantly modies the cash ows.
Embedded derivatives which are not clearly and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are separated and accounted for as stand alone derivatives.
y Dividend distribution Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders and the minority shareholders in Companys subsidiaries are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Companys shareholders and Companys subsidiaries respectively.
z Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
za Borrowing costs Finance costs are generally expensed as incurred except where they relate to the nancing of construction or development of qualifying assets requiring a substantial period of time to prepare for their intended future use.
In the case of such qualifying assets, finance costs are capitalised up to the date when the asset is ready for its intended use.
The amount of finance costs capitalised before the effects of income tax for the period is determined by applying the interest rate applicable to appropriate borrowings outstanding during the period to the average amount of accumulated expenditure for the assets during the period.

Business Flat Tax impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica or IETU Effective 1 January 2008 a new alternative minimum corporate income tax called the Flat Rate Business Tax was introduced in Mexico to replace the existing business asset tax.
From this date companies are required to pay the greater of their mainstream corporate income tax liability for the year or their liability to IETU.
IETU is calculated at the rate of 16.5% for the calendar year 2008, 17% for 2009 and 17.5% for subsequent years and applies to the sale of goods, rendering of independent services and temporary use or enjoyment of goods.
In calculating the charge to IETU, deductions are allowed for certain expenses incurred in generating income.
In respect of the Group, management has undertaken calculations to determine the impact of the new IETU provisions on the Group.
As a result of such analysis, management has concluded that there should be no material impact on the Consolidated Group, since in all instances, the mainstream corporate income tax liability for each group company is forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge.
Accordingly, no IETU liability should arise in the foreseeable future.
12 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
As described in note 20, the share capital for the Company in the periods prior to the Pre-IPO Reorganisation on 18 April 2008 is presented as if this reorganisation was completed as at 1 January 2007.
The company has no dilutive potential ordinary shares.
As of 31 December 2008 and 2007, earnings per share have been calculated as follows: Year ended 31 December 2008 2007 profit from continuing operation attributable to equity holders of the Company US$000 127,949 143,497 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue ooo 687,688 634,270 Basic and diluted earnings per share 0.186 0.226 For 2007 the EPS calculation has assumed that the ordinary shares in issue pursuant to the Merger agreement dated 18 April 2008 have been in issue throughout the periods.
The valuation of these assets was determined with reference to market value or, for assets of a specialised nature, at their depreciated replacement cost.
In accordance with IFRS1 the deemed cost of these items of property, plant and equipment as of 1 January 2007, the date of transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to the valuation as of 1 January 2005, adjusted for depreciation for the period until the date of transation.
Construction in progress relates mainly to mining projects taking place in Saucito, Juanicipio and Penmont mines.
In December 2008 the Group acquired the Noche Buena gold project in Sonora, Mexico.
The consideration for this project was US$25.0 million payable in cash at acquisition date and US$5.0 million payable upon commencement of commercial production.
A royalty is then payable on production.
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2008 was $nil 2007: $nil.

2008 ANNUAL REPORT 101 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 PROVISION FOR MINE CLOSURE COST The provision represents the discounted values of the estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits.
The present value of the provision at 31 December 2008 has been calculated using an annual real discount rate of 4.33 per cent 2007: 4.83 per cent.
Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling, and reclamation alternatives and timing and the levels of discount and ination rates.
It is important to note that Mexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions.
It is the Groups intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reect this level of expense.
The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the life of the mines.
The provision is expected to become payable at the end of the useful life of each mine, which ranges from 12 to 19 years from 31 December 2008 and 2007.

25 COMMITMENTS a Capital expenditure: A summary of capital expenditure commitments is as follows: Year ended 31 December 2008 2007 in thousands of US dollars Minera Saucito, S. A. fide C. V. 36,602 24,420 Minera Penmont, S. fide R. L. fide C:V. 22,583 15,930 Minera Mexicana La Cinega, S. A. fide C. V. 5,261 12,835 Minera Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. 9,893 10,726 Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S. A. fide C. V. 262 - 74,601 63,911 26 OPERATING LEASES a Leases as lessor The group leases certain small mines to third parties.
These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of approximately one and a half years.
Future minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: As of 31 December 2008 2007 in thousands of US dollars Within one year 1,432 720 After one year but not more than five years 1,447 480 2,879 1,200 104 FINANCIALS b Leases as lessee The group has financial commitments in respect of non-cancellable operating leases for land, ofces and equipment.
These leases have non-cancellable lease terms of one year and have an average life of between two and four years, with renewal terms at the option of the lessee at lease payments based on market prices at the time of renewal.
There are not restrictions placed upon the Group by entering into these leases.
The future minimum rental commitments under these leases are as follows: As of 31 December 2008 2007 in thousands of US dollars Within one year 1,134 434 After one year but not more than five years 1,495 463 2,629 897 As of 31 December 2008 2007 in thousands of US dollars Minimum lease payments expensed in the year 965 578 27 CONTINGENCIES As of 31 December 2008, the Group has the following contingencies: a The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.
b Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the ling of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest.
Under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods.
In addition, because a number of tax periods remain open to review by the tax authorities, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest.
It is not practical to determine the amount of any such potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome.
However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.
c On 8 May 2008, the Company and Peoles entered into the Separation Agreement the Separation Agreement.
This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Peoles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Peoles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 Admission.

Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate Peoles has agreed to indemnify the Fresnillo Group in relation to i any tax charge, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may incur as a result of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation including as a result of a transaction following Admission of a member of the Fresnillo Group, provided that Peoles has confirmed that the proposed transaction will not give rise to a tax charge, or as a result of a transaction of a member of the Peoles Group on or after Admission, the Global Offer or Admission and ii certain tax aspects of certain other pre-Admission transactions.
Peoles liability under these indemnities and in respect of general tax liabilities arising pre-Admission which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Fresnillo Group shall not exceed US$500 million.
If a member of the Fresnillo Group forming part of Peoles tax consolidation pays an intra-group dividend in excess of its CUFIN account after Admission and is relieved of tax as a result of the consolidation, it is required to pay Peoles an amount in respect of that tax.

The Group historically entered into derivative transactions with the purpose of managing commodity price risk associated with the sale of gold and silver.
These derivative hedging instruments were terminated during the second half of 2007 resulting in a cash payment of US$81.3 million at the date of termination.
The cumulative hedging losses relating to the terminated hedging instruments are deferred in equity and reclassied to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs.
During 2008 pre-tax losses of US$45.6 million 2007: US$63.4 million were recycled to the income statement with respect to the derivatives terminated in 2007.
These amounts were included in revenue.

32 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale assets and trade payables.
As at 31 December 2007 these also included interest bearing loans and borrowings to and from related parties.
During 2008 the Group has entered into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing base metals commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk.
Historically, the Group also entered into derivative transactions to manage precious metals commodity risk but during 2007 these instruments were terminated and the Group has assumed precious metals commodity price risk exposure.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: a Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate and equity price risk b Credit risk c Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
Prior to the IPO in May 2008 financial risk was managed as part of the Peoles Group, with the Peoles Audit Committee having responsibility for its oversight.
Subsequent to the IPO, these risk management activities are performed by the Fresnillo Group.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Groups income or the value of its financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
110 FINANCIALS Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar primarily the Mexican Peso and GBP Sterling.
Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchases of services, xed assets, spare parts and other items.
As a result, the Group has financial liabilities denominated in Pesos.
The Group also holds cash and cash equivalents in both the Mexican Peso and GBP Sterling.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the Mexican Peso compared to the US dollar on the Groups profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant.
It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable exchange rates for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the GBP sterling compared to the US dollar on the Groups profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant: INCREASE DECREASE EFFECT ON PROFIT Year ended 31  BEFORETAX EFFECTONEQUITY in thousands of US dollars in thousands of US dollars 2008 10% 4,760 10% 6,236 2007 10% 10% Commodity risk The Group has exposure to changes in metals prices specically silver, gold, lead and zinc which have a significant effect on the Groups results.
These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.
During 2008 the Group entered into certain derivative instruments to manage base metals commodity price uctuations, specically zinc and lead see note 31 for additional detail.
Historically the Group used derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price uctuations.
This practice was discontinued in 2007, when the Group assumed precious metals commodity risk exposure in response to favorable price trends.
All related derivatives were terminated during 2007 see note 31 for further detail.
As described in note 15, the Group entered into the Silverstream contract on 31 December 2007 which represents a derivative financial instrument.
As such, the Group is exposed to changes in the value of the Silverstream contract as a result of changes in commodity prices.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in gold and silver prices, reecting the effect on the Groups profit before tax and equity, assuming the same percentage change in prices underlying the valuation of derivatives, with all other variables held constant: INCREASE DECREASE IN EFFECT ON PROFIT Year ended 31 December GOLDANDSILVERPRICES BEFORETAX in thousands of US dollars 2008 15% 57,867 15% 57,867 2007 5% 19,425 5% 19,425 The above table reects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities to gold and silver price movements.
For 2008 and 2007, this sensitivity with relation to profit before tax, only relates to the Silverstream contract, which is only impacted by silver price risk.
There is no impact on equity, beyond the impact of profit before tax and retained earnings.
The impact of any reasonably possible change in the silver and gold prices on the valuation of embedded derivatives arising from provisional pricing arrangements is not significant on the pre-tax profit or equity of the Group.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in zinc and lead prices, reecting the effect on the Groups profit before tax and equity, assuming the same percentage change in prices underlying the valuation of derivatives, with all other variables held constant: 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 111 FRESNILLO PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCREASE DECREASE IN EFFECT ON PROFIT Year ended 31 December LEAD AND ZINC PRICES BEFORE TAX EFFECT ON EQUITY in thousands of US dollars in thousands of US dollars 2008 15% 360 15% 360 2007 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash ows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally relating to the Silverstream contract and cash balances held at the balance sheet date.
The Groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any oating element of the Groups interest bearing loans and borrowings.
As of 31 December 2008 there were no interest bearing loans and borrowings outstanding.
As of 31 December 2007 100% of interest bearing loans and borrowings were oating rate.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date as well as the impact of the change in interest rate on the valuation of the Silverstream contract: BASIS POINT INCREASE EFFECT ON PROFIT Year ended 31 December DECREASE IN INTEREST RATE BEFORE TAX in thousands of US dollars 2008 100 17,142 100 19,478 2007 100 25,952 100 28,570 The sensitivity in 2008 primarily relates to the valuation of the Silverstream contract and interest on cash balances held as at the year end.
In 2007 this principally related to the Silverstream contract.
The above table assumes that interest bearing loans and borrowings and loans due from related parties as at 31 December 2007 are not repaid during the following twelve months.
In practice, all oating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings as at 31 December 2007 except for the $350 million loan from Minas Peoles, S. A. fide C. V. relating to the Silverstream contract, were repaid within 3 months of the balance sheet date.
The maturity of the Groups interest bearing xed rate instruments as at 31 December 2007 varied from 5 to 29 days following the balance sheet date.
Therefore any reasonably possible change in interest rates on xed rate financial assets or liabilities would not materially impact the Groups pre-tax profit or equity.
Equity price risk The Group has exposure to changes in the price of equity instruments that it holds as available-for-sale assets.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of available-for-sale assets to a reasonably possible change in market price of these equity instruments, reecting the effect on the Groups profit before tax and equity: INCREASE DECREASE IN EQUITY PRICE OF AVAILABLEEFFECT ON PROFIT Year ended 31 December FOR-SALE ASSETS BEFORE TAX EFFECT ON EQUITY in thousands of US dollars in thousands of US dollars 2008 5% 184 2,092 5% 2,276 2007 5% 624 941 5% 624 941 b Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets.
These financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, the Silverstream contract and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Groups policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Groups financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
As disclosed in note 17, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties.
At each balance sheet date, the Groups financial assets were neither impaired nor past due, other than Other receivables as disclosed in note 28.
The Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Peoles, the Groups primary customer throughout 2008 and 2007.
A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract.
Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Peoles group which currently owns 77 per cent of the shares of the Company and are considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating.
All receivables are not past due.
112 FINANCIALS Refer to note 17 for analysis of trade receivables ageing.
For the periods prior to the IPO, Peoles treasury policies required all of the Groups subsidiaries to concentrate their surplus funds within the Peoles cash-pooling facility for investment management.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had invested its surplus funds in cash and in cash deposits with Servicios Industriales Peoles, S. A. fide C. V. Following the IPO the Groups surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions.
In order to minimize exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 Moodys and mxA-1 Standards and Poors and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days.
The maximum credit exposure at reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 28 for the maximum credit exposure to related party balances with Met-Mex and note 19 for the maximum exposure to cash and cash equivalents.
The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2008, being $318 million.
c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Prior to the IPO the Groups liquidity was managed as part of the cash management of the Peoles Group.
Subsequent to the IPO, the Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash ows from operations and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below summarises the maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.
WITHIN 1 YEAR 1-2 YEARS 2-3 YEARS 3 YEARS TOTAL As at 31 December 2008 Interest bearing loans and borrowings Trade and other payables 33,228 33,228 Derivative financial instruments assets 2,928 2,928 Derivative financial instruments liabilities 60,000 60,000 As at 31 December 2007 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 462,318 462,318 Trade and other payables 22,318 22,318 Derivative financial instruments The disclosed financial derivative instruments in the above table are the gross undiscounted cash ows.
However those amounts may be settled gross or net.
The following table shows the corresponding estimated inows based on the contractual terms: WITHIN 1 YEAR 1-2 YEARS 2-3 YEARS 3 YEARS TOTAL As at 31 December 2008 Inows 51,205 51,205 Outows 62,928 62,928 Net 11,723 11,723 Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management Prior to the IPO, the capital of the Group was managed as part of the capital of the Peoles Group.
Subsequent to the IPO, the primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios that support its business and maximise shareholder value.
Management considers capital to consist only of equity as disclosed in the balance sheet.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

Deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.
To the extent that future cash ows and taxable income differ signicantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.

The assessment of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and estimates of the outcome of future events.
c Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the change of presentation currency to US dollars.
In the previous year, the Companys presentation currency was pound sterling and the Company has changed the presentation currency in order to be consistent with the functional currency.
This change has been retrospectively applied but has not had any effect on the financial statements.
d Standards, interpretations and amendment to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Companys accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods but which the Company has not adopted early.
Those that are applicable to the Company are as follows: IFRS 8 Operating Segments is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
The adoption of this standard will not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Company.
IFRS 3R introduces a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations occurring after this date that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition occurs, and future reported results.
IAS27R requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.
The changes to IFRS 3R and IAS27R will affect future acquisitions or loss of control and transactions with minority interests.
IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, the amendments to IFRS 1 allows an entity to determine the cost of investment in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities or associates in its opening IFRS financial statements in accordance with IAS 27 or using a deemed cost.
The amendment to IAS requires all dividends from subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate to be recognized in the income statement.
The new requirements may impact the Companys presentation of dividends.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Companys financial statements in the period of initial application.
Those new standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not applicable to the Company are as follows: IFRS 2 Amendment Share-based Payment, effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, claries that only service conditions and performance conditions are vesting conditions, and other features of a share-based payment are not vesting conditions.
Management does not expect this amendment to impact the Company.
IAS 23 Amendment, Borrowing Costs revised in March 2007, will be applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 23 Revised requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
Management considers this amendment is not applicable to the Company, as the Company does not have qualifying assets.
The instruments to be classied as equity are puttable financial instruments and those instruments 2008 ANNUAL REPORT 119 FRESNILLO PLC Fresnillo plc NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS that impose an obligation on the entity to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on liquidation.
IFRIC 13 will become mandatory for the Companys financial statements beginning April 1, 2009 with earlier application permitted.
The Company has concluded that the amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance of the Company.
IFRIC 15 Agreement for the Construction of Real Estate, IFRIC 15 was issued in July 2008 and becomes effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
It claries when and how revenue and related expenses from the sale of a real state unit should be recognized if an agreement between a developer and buyer is reached before the construction of the real estate is completed.
As such it provides guidance on identifying the foreign currency risks that qualify for hedge accounting in the hedge of a net investment, where within the Group the hedging instruments can be held in the hedge of a net investment and how an entity should determine the amount of foreign currency gain or loss, relating to both the net investment and the hedging instrument, to be recycled on the disposal of the net investment.
ICRIC 17 claries that a dividend payable should be recognised when the dividend is appropriately authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the entity.
e Foreign currency translation The Companys financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.
The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates and the Directors consider that this has changed in the year as a result of the Company becoming the holding company for Fresnillo Group, and changes in the transactions undertaken following the IPO.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.
f Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
Dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Dividends received out of pre-acquisition profits of a subsidiary are recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the investment.
Dividends received out of post-acquisition profits are recorded in the income statement.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary is in excess of its recoverable amount.
If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reect the asset at the recoverable amount.
g Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classied as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: loans and receivables: held-to maturity investments: or as available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classication of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets classied as held for trading and other assets designated as such on inception are included in this category.
120 FINANCIALS Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
h Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
The Company first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classied as available for sale are not recognised in the income statement.
i Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value.

l Financial liabilities The Company recognises financial liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
m Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial information and are disclosed in notes unless their occurrence is remote.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial information, but they are disclosed in notes if they are deemed probable.
n Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benets will ow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured.

Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Companys right to receive the payment is established.
o Finance income and costs Finance income and costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, interest income on funds invested and gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments.
p Income tax Current income tax Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
122 FINANCIALS Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
q Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
r Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Company uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in prices of base metals and foreign exchange which impact its financial and business transactions.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement, as finance cost or income.
The Companys derivative activities were limited in volume and confined to risk management activities.
Usually, hedges were designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.
During 2008 the Company has entered a number of derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in prices of base metals and foreign exchange which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries.
In the Groups financial statements these are designated as cash ow hedges but for the purposes of the Companys stand alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash ow hedges.
2008 ANNUAL REPORT 123 FRESNILLO PLC Fresnillo plc NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Embedded derivatives Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives at the date that the Company first becomes party to the contract, with reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that signicantly modies the cash ows.

t Value added tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of value added tax The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

Business Flat Tax Impuesto Empresarial a Tasa Unica or IETU Effective 1 January 2008 a new alternative minimum corporate income tax called the Flat Rate Business Tax was introduced in Mexico to replace the existing business asset tax.
In respect of the Company, management has undertaken calculations to determine the impact of the new IETU provisions on the Company.
As a result of such analysis, management has concluded that there should be no material impact on the Company, since in all instances, the mainstream corporate income tax liability of the Company is forecast to be greater than the future potential IETU charge.

a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Companys income or the value of its financial instruments.
132 FINANCIALS The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign currency risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in a foreign currency primarily the Mexican Peso and GBP Sterling other than the Companys functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchases of services and loans to subsidiaries.
The Company also holds cash and cash equivalents in both the Mexican Peso and GBP Sterling.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the Mexican Peso compared to the US dollar on the Companys profit before tax, with all other variables held constant.

These financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Companys policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterpartys failure to honour its obligations.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty.
The Companys financial assets are with counterparties with what the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating.
As disclosed in note 7, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties.
At each balance sheet date, the Companys financial assets were neither impaired nor past due.
The Companys surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S. A. fide C. V. which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in a number of financial institutions.
In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of P-1 Moodys and mxA-1 Standards and Poors and above, and only for periods of less than 30 days.
The maximum credit exposure to each category of financial asset above is detailed in the relevant notes.
See note 13 for the maximum credit exposure to related parties balances and note 8 for maximum exposure to cash and cash equivalents.
c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash ows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
