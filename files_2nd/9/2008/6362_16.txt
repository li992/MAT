G4S plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2008 39 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED At 31 December 2008 c Performance Share Plan long-term incentive plan continued Following a review of the operation of the PSP by the Remuneration Committee including detailed analysis of the current EPS and TSR targets, the committee was satisfied that both measures and targets remained appropriate for 2009.
In addition, the committee also recognised that the current method of calculating both EPS and TSR introduces inappropriate effects both positive and negative of fluctuations in currency exchange rates outside the control of participants.
In an effort to more closely align the PSP with the underlying performance of the company, the committee plans to remove the impact of currency movements from the calculation of both EPS and TSR.
In respect of EPS, the committee believes that this is the correct method of calculation because the companys exposure to currency risk is almost entirely translational and not transactional.
The committee believes that if the impact of currencies is excluded from the EPS calculation, it is consistent to calculate TSR on a local currency basis so that currency movements do not impact either measure and instead focus on rewarding superior management performance.
The EPS for 2005, which is the base year for determining the EPS performance for the PSP awards vesting in 2009, is 11.7 pence if calculated on a constant exchange rate and lower, at 11.1 pence, if calculated on actual exchange rates.
For PSP awards based on EPS performance for the three years to 31 December 2008, vesting in 2009 will be unaffected as a result of the application of the committees adjustment to EPS performance for currency fluctuations over the period.
Similarly, TSR-based awards vesting in 2010 and thereafter will be calculated on a local currency basis.

40 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED At 31 December 2008 Performance graph The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company from its first day of listing, 20 July 2004, until 31 December 2008, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth 100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE 100 constituent companies over the same period.
The directors believe this to be an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison given the size and geographic coverage of the company and the fact that the company is itself a member of the FTSE 100.
The graph also compares the companys performance over the same period with the bespoke group of companies which is used now for comparative total shareholder return purposes in the companys performance share plan.
Until 2007, the FTSE 100 constituent companies were used for this purpose.
The values attributable to the bespoke comparator group companies have been weighted in accordance with the market capitalisation of the companies and spot exchange rates were used at each of the relevant dates to obtain constant currency.
