Notes to the accounts continued 26 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
Policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currency.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and the net exposure hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and Europe, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, China, India and South Africa.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Liquidity risk The main source of long-term funding for the Group is its unsecured revolving credit facility, which was renewed in February 2008 for a further five years with a small syndicate of its principal bankers and extended to 165 million.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 225,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a 160,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 29 March 2008.
Transactional exposures The table below shows the Groups net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
These are the assets and liabilities of Group companies which are not denominated in the functional currency of the company involved.
They comprise cash and overdrafts, and certain debtors and creditors.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
As at year end these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 2008 Sterling US Dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of operation 000 000 000 000 000 685 1,637 521 1,801 Sterling US Dollar 7 10 17 Euro 411 192 8 595 Other 37 1,335 113 655 2,066 Total 367 2,212 1,740 126 4,445 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 2007 Sterling US Dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of operation 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 839 678 84 1,601 US Dollar 8 9 17 Euro 175 5 187 357 Other 224 1,038 43 343 1,562 Total 391 1,872 626 614 3,503 The amounts shown in the tables above take into account the effect of any forward currency contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
