Governance This is supported by an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group, by the Group Risk and Business Assurance function.
Communication with investors The Board believes it is important to explain business developments and financial results to the Companys shareholders and to understand any shareholder concerns.
The principal communication media used to impart information to shareholders are news releases including results announcements and Company publications.
In all such communications, care is taken to ensure that no price sensitive information is released.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have lead responsibility for investor relations.
They are supported by a dedicated investor relations department that, amongst other matters, organises presentations for analysts and institutional investors.
There is a full programme of regular dialogue with major institutional shareholders, fund managers, analysts, retail brokers and credit investors, upon which the Chairman ensures that the Board receives regular updates at Board meetings.
The Board also receives periodic reports on investors views of the performance of the Company.
All the Non-Executive Directors and, in particular, the Chairman and Senior Independent Director, are available to meet with major shareholders, if such meetings are required.
The Company also communicates with shareholders through the Annual General Meeting, at which the Chairman gives an account of the progress of the business over the last year, and a review of current issues, and provides the opportunity for shareholders to ask questions.
Further financial and business information is available on the Companys website, www.
