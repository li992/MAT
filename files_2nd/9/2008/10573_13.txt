The Group assesses amounts due from construction contract customers and trade receivables balances for impairment and establishes a provision for impairment losses that represents its estimate of incurred losses.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows: Gross Provision for Provision for trade impairment Gross trade impairment receivables losses receivables losses 2008 2008 2007 2007 m m m m Not past due 143.6 0.6 144.7 Past due 1 to 30 days 24.7 0.1 34.3 Past due 31 to 120 days 12.2 6.2 Past due 121 to 365 days 14.5 0.3 12.3 1.8 Greater than one year 1.9 1.7 9.4 3.1 196.9 2.7 206.9 4.9 The movement in the provision for impairment losses on trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2008 2007 m m Balance at beginning of the year 4.9 1.5 Amounts written off during the year 1.9 0.1 Amounts recovered during the year 0.3 0.1 Increase in provision recognised in the income statement 3.6 Balance at 31 December 2.7 4.9 b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.
The ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the Board.
The Group aims to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group actively manages its liquidity profile while ensuring that the return achieved on cash and investments is maximised.
The Group had not drawn down any current debt facilities as at the reporting date 2007: nil.

Current tax liabilities and trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and therefore have no weighted average effective interest rates.
Retirement benefit obligations are measured at the net of the present value of retirement benefit obligations and the fair value of the Plan assets.
Finance lease liabilities are carried at the present value of the minimum lease payments with the future value of finance charges.
An analysis of the maturity profile for finance lease liabilities is contained in note 16.
The Group reports cash balances daily, and invests surplus cash to maximise income whilst preserving credit quality.
The Group prepares weekly short-term and monthly long-term cash forecasts, which are used to assess the Groups expected cash performance, and compare with the facilities available to the Group and the Groups covenants.
In addition to its cash balances, the Group has a 25m loan facility available until November 2009, a 25m loan facility available until June 2010, and a further 25m loan facility available until June 2009 which can be extended to June 2010 at the Groups option.
Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a downturn in contracting volumes, a decrease in the value of open market sales, deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the profitability of work, delayed receipt of cash from customers and the risk that major clients or suppliers suffer financial distress leading to non-payment of debts or costly and time consuming reallocation and rescheduling of work.
Certain measures and KPIs are continually monitored throughout the Group and used to quickly identify issues as they arise, enabling the Group to address them promptly.
Key amongst these are continual monitoring of the forward order book, including the status of orders and likely timescales for realisation so that contracting volumes are well understood, monitoring of overhead levels to ensure they remain appropriate to contracting volumes, weekly monitoring of open market house sales volumes and prices, continual monitoring of working capital exceptions overdue debts and conversion of work performed into certificates and invoices, continual review of levels of current and forecast profitability on contracts, review of client and supplier credit references, approval of credit terms with clients and suppliers to ensure they are appropriate.
