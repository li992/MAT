Independent Auditors Report To the members of The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Opinion on Financial Statements of The Scottish Investment Trust PLC In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the companys affairs as at 31 October 2013 and of the companys profit for the year then ended: the companys financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice: and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements comprise the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds, Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes 1 to 18.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law, United Kingdom Accounting Standards United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts.
Going Concern As required by the Listing Rules, we have reviewed the directors statement on page 18 that the company is a going concern.
We confirm that: we have not identified material uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the companys ability to continue as a going concern which we believe would need to be disclosed in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards: and we have concluded that the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern.

Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our Application of Materiality We determined materiality for the company to be 22.5m, which is below 3% of net assets.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of 430,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
