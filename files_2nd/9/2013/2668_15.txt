party digital entertainment plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and Company statement of financial position, the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity, the consolidated and Company statements of cashows and the related notes.
Thenancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements and significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are, by their nature, inherently uncertain see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the Directors judgements against available evidence, including the riskofmanagement override and bias, forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our Group audit in the current year are noted below.
This is not a complete list ofall risks or areas of audit focus identied by our audit.
We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit & Risk Committee.
Their report on those matters that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on pages 75 to 79: t 8F GPDVTFE PO UIF BSFB PG SFWFOVF SFDPHOJUJPO 5IF NBJO SJTLT BSF UIF DPNQMFUFOFTT FYJTUFODF BDDVSBDZ BOE QSFTFOUBUJPO JO UIF TUBUFNFOU ofcomprehensive income of net gaming revenue and other revenue.
Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of the various income streams earned by the Group are given in note 2 to the financial statements.
The Group also makes certain judgements around the estimates andtreatment of certain customer bonuses that are either deducted from revenue or treated as a cost, an estimation of the fair value of open bets that need to be provided for against revenue, the timing of revenue recognition and the treatment of contractual arrangements for revenue streams entered into.
We documented and tested the key IT and manual general and application controls over the completeness and accuracy of the Groups main gaming systems.
This included conducting test bets and testing the reconciliation between the main gaming systems and the nominal ledger.
Wealso undertook analytical and other substantive testing, including IT interrogation work over net gaming revenue, other revenue and the treatment of customer bonuses.
We reviewed the assumptions, estimates and judgements applied by management related to certain customer bonuses and open bets and DIBMMFOHFE UIFTF CBTFE PO BWBJMBCMF JOGPSNBUJPO BOE QBTU FYQFSJFODF UPHFUIFS XJUI BOZ FYUFSOBM JOEVTUSZ JOGPSNBUJPO BWBJMBCMF We reviewed key contracts related to revenue share agreements and other relevant documentation to assess whether the revenue recognised had been correctly treated as gross or net in line with the Groups stated accounting policies and whether any other terms within the contract hadany material accounting or disclosure impacts.
We also reviewed contract databases to establish whether revenue recognised in the Groups financial statements was complete for material contracts entered into by the Group.
We also assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted by the Group comply with IFRS adopted by the EU and industry standards.
Where revenue was recorded through journal entries we performed testing to establish whether a service had been provided in the financial yearto support this recognition.

Additions to intangible assets primarily comprise those intangible assets recognised on acquisitions and internally generated computer software enhancements.
The Group holds material amounts related to these assets which they support that the carrying value is not impaired through compiling discounted cashow models with assumptions, estimates and judgements that have been reviewed by management.

For planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could inuence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.

Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identied misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.

112 Independent Auditors Report An overview of the scope of our group audit The majority of the accounting for the Group is centrally managed from Gibraltar.
At the planning stage of the audit the Group auditors review the consolidated results broken down by subsidiary location.

Other locations that do not meet these criteria are asked to perform reviews or reviews with selected audit procedures on certain balances such as cash or payroll based on their relative size, risks in the business and our knowledge of those entities based on a lower level of component materiality set by the Group audit team.
