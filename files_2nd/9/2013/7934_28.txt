At 30 September 2013, the contingent liability totalled 11,238 million 2012: 9,378 million.

Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liabilities for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated financial statements as at 30 September 2013.
