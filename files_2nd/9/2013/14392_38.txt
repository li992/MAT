27 Employee share schemes continued 2008 Value Sharing Plan 2008 VSP The VSP was a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders in July 2008 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels.
The final vesting took place in November 2008.
Corporate participants were rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities were rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
For the Group scheme, one-third of the award depended on the growth in Smiths TSR over and above the median for the companies comprising the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies and the remaining two-thirds of each award was determined by the growth in internal value in excess of fixed rate.
The growth in internal value was calculated as follows: adjusted profit before tax PBT times the ratio of PBT to market capitalisation determined at the date of grant plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders.
The divisional awards depended on meeting an internal value growth target set for the division in which the participant worked.
The performance conditions were measured over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
For the Group scheme, the growth in internal value was tested against a hurdle rate of 9.5% a year.
Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, as introduced in October 2005, the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
In July 2008 the CIP was amended.
From 2009 participants have been required to invest 50% of their post tax bonus in purchased shares.
The performance conditions have been expanded to include an enhanced performance condition of ROCE exceeding WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum.
If the enhanced performance condition is met, two matching shares will be issued for every purchased share.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 1,195.79p 2012: 992.15p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.

The key assumptions used in the models for 2013 and 2012 are volatility of 25% to 27% 2012: 27% to 30% and dividend yield of 3.75% 2012: 3.75%.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for CIP of 10.84 2012: 9.44, group long term incentive plans of 9.18 2012: 7.14 and divisional long term incentive plans of 10.84 2012: 8.94.
The fair value disclosed for the CIP award treats the two matching shares as separate options.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 12.8m 2012: 14.3m, of which 12.1m 2012: 14.4m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.
At 31 July 2013 the creditor relating to cash-settled schemes is 0.5m 2012: 0.4m.
