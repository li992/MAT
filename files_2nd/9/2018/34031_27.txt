120 Independent Auditors Report to the members of Barratt Developments PLC Report on the audit of the Financial Statements Summary of our audit approach Opinion The key audit matter that we identified in the current year was inventory valuation Key audit matters and margin recognition.
In our opinion: The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was 41.7m which Materiality the Financial Statements of Barratt Developments PLC the Company and its subsidiaries wasdetermined on the basis of 5% of statutory profit before tax.

All audit work was completed by the Group audit team.
the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: We have considered inventory valuation and margin recognition to be a key audit matter owing to the significance of judgements as set out in note 2.3, which determine the profit that the the Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period.

Annual Report and Accounts 2018 Barratt Developments PLC 121 Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Inventory valuation and margin recognition Key audit matter description The carrying value for inventory as at 30 June 2018 is 4,516.7m 2017: 4,475.4m.
Inventory comprises primarily of land and work in progress: work in progress is made up of the construction cost of developing a site and is transferred to cost of sales as each legal completion takes place.
The Groups cost allocation policy determines the total profit forecast for each site.
This allows the land and build costs of a development to be allocated to each individual unit, ensuring the forecast margin per unit isequalised across the development.
This cost allocation framework drives the recognition of costs as each unit is sold which is the key judgement in the income statement and is where fraud could occur.
Accordingly, we consider the recognition of cost per unit and therefore the appropriate margin to be a key audit matter.
For each development there is judgement in: estimating the inputs included within a site budget, including future revenues and cost to complete, in order to determine the level of profit that each unit of the development will deliver: appropriately allocating costs such as shared infrastructure relating to a development so that the gross profit margin in percentage terms achieved on each individual unit is equal: recognising site contingencies and their impact on margin: and recording the variation when a deviation from the initial budget occurs and ensuring such variations are appropriately recognised.
These judgements impact the profit recognised on each unit sold and reported operating margin is a key metric for the Group.
Refer to page 82 Audit Committee Report and note 2.3 Financial Statement disclosures including the related Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty.
How the scope of our audit Our work included the following: responded to the key audit matter tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls governing work in progress, namely those relating to the authorisation of site budgets, Managements review of actual performance versus budget and the approval of journals transferring costs across sites or phases of a development: we also tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the expenditure cycle which included the tendering, authorisation and payment of subcontractors and suppliers: audited a sample of the Groups inventory balances by corroborating a sample of additions to source documentation: attended a number of valuation meetings in certain divisions across the business to observe and validate the effectiveness of this critical control and verify that the margin in the financial statements isequivalent to the site valuation, utilising our internal specialists where appropriate: made enquiries of Management to support their assumptions and seek external corroboration where available, including from our internal real estate specialists, regarding forecast sales prices and costs to complete: assessed the appropriateness and completeness of land equalisation adjustments, including assessing changes to assumptions from prior periods.
Such changes may include contingencies and overage: analysed completions in the period for a sample of sites and compared the achieved margin to the equalised margin determined within the original budget and the prior year.
We evaluated and assessed significant variances with Management and obtained relevant supporting evidence: tested and agreed on a sample basis certain costs incurred to date included within land and work in progress as well as reviewing the proportion of that expenditure recognised as a cost of sale in the year in respect of units sold: analysed journal postings and additions made to the inventory balance to highlight any items which potentially should have been recorded as an expense.
We also tested the valuation of these additions byagreeing to supporting invoices: assessed a sample of cost busts and savings identified and understood the nature of them: and analysed average cost per square foot to identify any anomalies to investigate.
Key observations Based on the procedures performed, we concluded that the Groups cost allocation framework appears reasonable for the intended purpose of recognising appropriate margins on unit completion.
The accounting for cost allocation, both at site start and on an ongoing basis is in line with this framework.
