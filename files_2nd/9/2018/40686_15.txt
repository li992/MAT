Summary of our audit approach Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: Revenue and profit recognition Management override of controls Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets Defined benefit pensions liabilities valuation Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with and any key audit matters which are the same as the prior year identified with.
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was 5.0m which was determined on the basis of 5% of underlying profit before tax.
Scoping We focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 17 2017: 20 locations, 12 2017: 12 of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining 5 2017: 8 were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement.
These 17 locations accounted for 88% 2017: 88% of group revenue and 86% 2017: 94% of underlying profit before tax.
Significant changes in our approach The reduced number of audit locations reflects amalgamations made by management of certain business units.
There are no other significant changes to our audit approach.

We considered as part of our risk assessment the nature of the group, its business model and related risks including where relevant the impact of Brexit, the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework and the system of internal control.
We evaluated the directors assessment of the groups ability to continue as a going concern, including challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used to make the assessment, and evaluated the directors plans for future actions in relation to their going concern assessment.

Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 82 Financial statements Independent Auditors Report continued TO THE MEMBERS OF ULTRA ELECTRONICS HOLDINGS PLC Revenue and profit recognition Key audit matter description The group recognised revenue of 766.7m in 2018 2017: 775.4m.
IFRS 15 was adopted on 1 January 2018 and all revenues are now accounted for under this standard.
462.7m of the 2018 revenue was recognised on an over time basis, and 304.0m on a point in time basis.
There is a risk arising from either error or fraud, that revenue and profit is recognised incorrectly based on judgements within the cost to complete estimate of significant contracts.
We consider that those contracts with a design phase have a heightened risk of cost escalation due to extended or unforeseen effort necessary to achieve contract milestones.
Further, given the bespoke nature and the length of time to develop and manufacture many of Ultras products and solutions, the contracts between Ultra and its customers can contain complex terms or contract variations and therefore there is also a risk that revenue is not recognised in accordance with such terms.
Refer to page 131 key sources of estimation uncertainty contract revenue and profit recognition : page 133 accounting policies revenue recognition : page 59 Audit Committee report significant judgements considered: and page 98 note 3 of the Financial Statements.
How the scope of our audit We assessed the adequacy of the design and implementation of controls over long-term contract responded to the key audit matter accounting.
To assess whether revenue recognised to date is based on the current best estimate of the degree of work performed under the contract, for a sample of contracts we reviewed the evidence for the progress made against the contract, such as milestone completion.
To verify the margin achieved on contracts recognised over time, we sought to confirm the costs to complete, by agreeing to evidence of committed spend, budgeted rates or actual costs incurred to date when compared to the remaining work to be performed under the contract.
We reviewed the contract risk registers to provide evidence over the judgement taken when providing for the cost of mitigating technical risks and meeting future milestones.
We understood and challenged managements judgements by referring to evidence including signed contract terms and latest project status reports, and discussed contract progress and future risks with contract engineers.
We also assessed the reliability of management estimates through consideration of the historical accuracy of prior period management estimates.
For our sample of contracts, we made enquiries as to any unusual contract terms or side agreements separate to the original contract, in addition to testing a sample of billings and costs incurred to date.
Key observations We considered the costs to complete and therefore the revenue and margin recognised on the sampled contracts to be appropriate, based on the assessment of the risks remaining in the contracts and work performed to date.
Management override of controls Key audit matter description We consider that the risk of error or fraud as a result of management override of controls is heightened in light of the revised full-year profit expectation communicated in June 2018.
We therefore consider this to be a key audit matter.
There are a number of areas within the Group financial statements which contain accounting estimates made by management or have been determined as a result of managements judgements as set out on page 131 critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, in particular those areas of judgement and estimation uncertainty related to contract revenue and profit recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible asset, and the valuation of pension liabilities.
In addition, management also exercised judgement in the presentation of the Groups income statement, and the classification of items excluded from underlying profit measures, in particular the S3 programme as set out in note 2 to the financial statements.
Accordingly, there is a risk that the Groups results are influenced through management bias in determining such estimates and judgements.
This risk can manifest itself through the posting of invalid journals, recorded to influence the financial statements, which circumvent the controls in place to stop the recording of inappropriate journals.
Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 83 How the scope of our audit We assessed the design and implementation of controls which address the risk of management responded to the key audit matter override at both a business unit and a group basis.
We reviewed the areas of judgement and estimation uncertainty related to the areas noted above to determine whether any evidence existed of management bias.
Further details of our audit response are included in the other key audit matters.
We challenged the distinction between underlying and non-underlying items of income or expense by considering the nature of each item.
We reviewed the disclosure in note 2 to the financial statements to assess whether it is consistent with our understanding.
We profiled the full years transactions listing to identify manual journals displaying characteristics of potential fraud.
For the journals identified together with the Group consolidation journals, we have understood the business rationale and obtained appropriate audit evidence to support the journal.
Key observations We did not identify any material matters or bias arising from management override of controls.
Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets Key audit matter description The group held 377.8m 2017: 394.5m of goodwill arising on its acquisitions made and 93.2m 2017: 118.4m of acquired intangibles as at 31 December 2018.
There is a risk that inappropriate judgements relating to future cashflow forecasts and discount rates are used which lead to the overstatement of the value in use, being the recoverable amount of these assets.
This could therefore result in an impairment being required.
This is particularly relevant given the volatility and uncertainty in defence spending in both new and traditional markets.
As a result of the poor financial performance in 2018, we have focused this key audit matter on the following goodwill and acquired intangible asset balances: goodwill attributable to the C2ISR cash generating unit group: and certain acquired intangible assets associated with the Herley business.
Refer to page 132 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions impairment testing : page 132 accounting policies goodwill : page 59 Audit Committee report significant judgements considered : and pages 103 to 105 note 14 and 15 of the Financial Statements.
How the scope of our audit We assessed the adequacy of the design and implementation of controls over monitoring the carrying responded to the key audit matter value of goodwill and acquired intangibles.
We challenged the discount rate and cash flow assumptions used by management in their impairment assessment.
We used valuation specialists within the audit team to benchmark the discount rate against independently available data, together with performing peer group analysis.
We obtained support for secured orders and used our understanding of these orders to underpin the groups cash flow forecasts, considered external data on forecast market growth as well as managements assessment of the impact of Brexit, and reviewed the historical performance of the businesses.
Having challenged the assumptions, we checked that the impairment model had been prepared onthebasis of managements assumptions and was arithmetically accurate.
We challenged the appropriateness of managements sensitivities based on our work performed on the key assumptions, and recalculated these sensitised scenarios.
With regards to the disclosures within the Annual Report, we assessed whether they appropriately reflect the facts and circumstances within managements assessment of impairment over goodwill and acquired intangibles and specifically on the disclosure relating to the C2ISR cash generating unit group under a sensitised scenario.
Key observations We are satisfied that headroom exists over the carrying value of the C2ISR cash generating unit group, and the acquired intangible assets associated with the Herley business, and therefore no impairment has been recognised.
We consider that the disclosure in note 14 of a goodwill impairment to the C2ISR cash generating unit group within a sensitised scenario is appropriate.
Ultra Electronics Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report 84 Financial statements Independent Auditors Report continued TO THE MEMBERS OF ULTRA ELECTRONICS HOLDINGS PLC Defined benefit pensions liabilities valuation Key audit matter description The group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Switzerland and Canada.
At 31 December 2018 the defined benefit pension scheme obligation was 370.7m 2017: 389.0m which resulted in a net IAS 19 Employment Benefits deficit of 73.0m 2017: 82.7m.
The UK scheme accounted for 98% of this net deficit.
There is a risk that the assumptions used in determining the defined benefit obligation for the UK scheme are not appropriate, resulting in an inappropriate pension valuation which would have a material impact on the financial statements.
The most sensitive assumption is the discount rate, and we also considered the assumptions relating to the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions GMP equalisation.
Refer to page 131 key sources of estimation uncertainty retirement benefit plans : page 135 accounting policies pensions : and page 59 Audit Committee report significant issues considered, and pages 120 to 123 note 30 of the Financial Statements.
How the scope of our audit We assessed the adequacy of the design and implementation of controls over the accounting for responded to the key audit matter defined benefit pension scheme.
We included a pension specialist within our audit team to assess the appropriateness of the assumptions through benchmarking to industry data and comparison with the peer group.
Along with our specialist, we also assessed the additional liability in respect of GMP equalisation.
We reviewed the suitability of the methodology used to value the defined benefit pension scheme obligation.
Key observations Our assessment concluded that Ultras pension assumptions overall lie in the middle of our acceptable range.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Materiality 5.0m 2017: 5.5m 2.0m 2017: 2.2m Basis for determining materiality 5% 2017: 5% of underlying profit before tax Parent company materiality represents less than 1% of net assets, but capped at 40% 2017: 40% Underlying profit before tax is reconciled to of the Group materiality.
statutory profit before tax in note 2 of the financial statements.
Rationale for the Underlying profit before tax is a key performance The parent company is non-trading, and we benchmark applied measure for the group and it is therefore an therefore consider that a balance sheet based appropriate basis on which to determine metric is most appropriate to determine materiality.
The parent company is also a component of the consolidated group financial statements, and so the determined materiality has been capped by the level of materiality identified for the component audits.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 250k 2017: 275k, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 85 An overview of the scope of our audit Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 17 2017: 20 locations, 12 2017: 12 of these were subject to a full audit, whilst the remaining 5 2017: 8 were subject to either an audit of specified account balances or specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the groups operations at those locations.
Underlying PBT 101m Group materiality Group materiality 5m UNDERLYING PBT Component materiality to range 3m to 2m Audit Committee reporting threshold 0.25m These 17 locations, which are largely located in the UK and USA, represent the principal business units and account for 88% 2017: 88% of the groups revenue and 86% 2017: 94% of the groups underlying profit before tax.
They also provided an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above.
Our audit work at the 17 units was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity, ranging from 2.0m to 3.0m 2017: 2.2m to 3.3m, which did not exceed 60% 2017: 60% of group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The group audit team follows a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the group audit team visits each of the significant overseas component locations at least once every three years.
Every year, regardless of whether we have visited or not, we include the component audit partner and other senior members of the component audit team in our team briefing, direct the scope of their work for the purposes of our group audit, discuss their risk assessment and review documentation of the findings from their work.
In 2018, a senior member of the group audit team visited all of the UK components as well as the following overseas components: USSI, Herley, Ocean Systems, NSPI and ATS.

report in respect of these matters.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that: Fair, balanced and understandable the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the groups position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit: or Audit committee reporting the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee: or Directors statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code the parts of the directors statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the companys compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.

Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the groups and the parent companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud are set out below.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRCs website at: www.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Annual Report & Accounts 2018 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Strategic report Governance report Financial statements 87 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, our procedures included the following: enquiring of management, internal audit and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the groups policies and procedures relating to: identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance.
In particular, we considered the response in relation to the ongoing SFO investigation: detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud: the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations: discussing among the engagement team, including all component audit teams, and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, and financial instruments, regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.
As part of this discussion, we identified potential for fraud in the following areas: manipulation of revenue and profit recognition to improve performance: management bias within the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty to improve performance: obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the group operates in, focusing on those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the group.
The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, pensions legislation and tax legislation.
Audit response to risks identified As a result of performing the above, we identified key audit matters with respect to revenue and profit recognition, and management override of controls.
The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.
In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with relevant laws and regulations discussed above: enquiring of management, the audit committee and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims: performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due tofraud: reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC: and in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments: assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias: challenging the presentation of the financial statements and the distinction between underlying and non-underlying items of income and expense, and: evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and all component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 In our opinion the part of the directors remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: the information given in the strategic report and the directors report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements: and the strategic report and the directors report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors report.
