Avast annual report 2018 99 Independent Auditors Report Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement We have nothing to report in respect of the following information in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs UK require us to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to: the disclosures in the annual report set out on page 46-47 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated: the directors confirmation set out on page 48 in the annual report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity: the directors statement set out on page 96 in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entitys ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements whether the directors statement in relation to going concern required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.
6R 3 is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit: or the directors explanation set out on page 48 in the annual report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
Overview of our audit approach Key audit matters Revenue recognition, including risk of management override, in particular: Licence revenue: Improper revenue recognition cut-off due to managements incentive to accelerate earnings, through manipulation of the licence term.
Licences, platform, and other revenue: Improper revenue recognition due to managements incentive to accelerate earnings, through manipulation of the timing of revenues or due to an error.
Computation of current and deferred income tax The Group is operating in multiple tax jurisdictions and undertook a number of significant transactions, during 2018.
There is a risk that taxation will not properly reflect all material transactions which arose during the reporting period correctly and income tax accounts, including deferred tax, in both the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of profit or loss will contain misstatement.

The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% of adjusted profit before tax PBT, 94% of Revenue and 97% of Total assets.
