Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 93 Group financial statements Independent auditors report continued to the members of Synthomer plc Our audit approach Overview Overall group materiality: 6.75 million 2017: 6.5 million, based on 5% of underlying profit before taxation.
Overall company materiality: 5.5 million 2017: 5.0 million, based on 2% of total assets.
Materiality Audit procedures provide coverage of 86% of revenue, 87% of operating profit and 90% of underlying operating profit.
Audit Audit scope covers nine countries, performing procedures over 14 entities scoping Financially significant components in the UK, Germany and Malaysia Valuation of Defined Benefit Pension Schemes.
Accounting for the acquisition of Pischelsdorf.
Provisions for Uncertain Tax Positions.
Areas of focus The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud Based on our understanding of the group industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related tobreaches of environmental, health and safety and compliance regulations, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements.
We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such asthe Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, Pensions legislation, UK tax legislation, UK environmental regulations and the EU registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulations and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant component teams.
We evaluated managements incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements including the risk of override of controls, and determined that the principal risks were related toposting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce expenditure, and management bias in accounting estimates.
The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors referred to in the scoping section of our report below, so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work.
Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and or component auditors included: Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud: Evaluation of managements controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities: Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to uncertain tax provisions and accounting for the acquisition of Pischelsdorf see related key audit matters below : Identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations or posted by senior management.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations isfrom the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of Defined Benefit Pension Schemes We obtained external actuarial reports of the UK and German As set out in Note 26 on page 133 the Group has significant schemes which set out the calculations and assumptions defined benefit pension schemes.
These primarily represent the underpinning the year end pension scheme valuation.
We read these Yule Catto Group retirement benefits scheme in the UK and an reports and were satisfied that the scope of their work was such that unfunded scheme in Germany, which account for 53.2 million we could use this work to provide evidence for the purpose of our and 69.1 million, respectively, of the net pension deficit of 132.5 audit.
We assessed the competency and objectivity of the external million recorded on the Group balance sheet at the year end.
We actuaries commissioned by the Group to perform the year end focused on the pension liabilities in particular, as the amounts calculations by considering their technical expertise and reflected in the financial statements for defined benefits schemes independence from the Group.
We identified no concerns over their are sensitive to relatively small changes in a few key assumptions competency or objectivity.
We used our own specialist actuarial such as the inflation rate, mortality tables and most notably, the knowledge to evaluate all the key assumptions used in each of the two discount rate applied.
The Group uses third party actuaries to schemes by comparing these assumptions to our expectations for calculate the amounts to reflect in the financial statements in similar schemes as at the year end.
We found managements respect of these schemes and it is accordingly important for us to assumptions to be within an acceptable range.
assess the work they perform and their competency to undertake the work in order to conclude on the results of their work.
Accounting for the acquisition of Pischelsdorf We evaluated the process used by management to identify and On 31 January 2018 the Group completed the acquisition value the assets and liabilities acquired.
We assessed the assets of the BASF Pischelsdorf Styrene Butadiene Rubber business and liabilities acquired and the fair value adjustments applied.
Pischelsdorf for consideration of 25.8 million, as described in The fair value adjustments were considered appropriate.
We considered the Directors process for identifying the intangible IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 3 requires that all assets assets acquired, considering the rationale for the acquisition and the and liabilities acquired in the business combination are recorded nature of the Pischelsdorf business.
Using our valuation specialists, we at fair values on acquisition.
Judgement is required in identifying assessed the valuation methodology used by the Directors in valuing and valuing all the assets and liabilities acquired, in particular the identified assets.
We evaluated the forecasts and data used and intangible assets which are recognised on acquisition.
Intangible assets totalling 17.6 million were identified relating to We were satisfied that the fair values of the intangible assets were customer relationships, a licensing agreement and a beneficial supportable, and that the assumptions used in valuing the assets lease.
The key judgements were in determining an appropriate were within an acceptable range.
methodology to value these assets and appropriate assumptions, including forecast revenue and profit, discount rate and rates of obsolescence to determine their fair values.
Provisions for Uncertain Tax Positions We used our tax specialists to assess the level of provisions held The Group has a wide geographic footprint and is subject to a against various tax exposures and to consider the appropriateness of range of tax laws in a number of different tax jurisdictions.
In our assessment we had regard to the nature of the determining the amount to record at the year-end for tax liabilities individual exposures, including their origin, and any developments in there is an element of judgement as to what amounts will the year to assess the rationale for their continued validity at the ultimately be payable for assessed tax exposures.
As set out in current year end.
As part of this work we inspected correspondence Note 10 at 31 December 2018, the Group has recorded current with tax authorities and the Groups tax advisors.
We challenged the tax liabilities totalling 38.3 million.
A significant element of this judgements made by assessing individual provisions against our tax liability relates to uncertain tax positions.
We focused on this expectations of potential exposures, having regard to the facts of area due to the size of the amounts involved and level of each case.
No significant issues arose from this work to suggest that judgement needed to determine the estimated provisions.
the judgements made and amounts recorded were inappropriate.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 95 Group financial statements Independent auditors report continued to the members of Synthomer plc How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
As set out on the inside front cover the Group reports its results as two segments: Europe and North America and Asia and the Rest of the World.
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of reporting units, being holding companies, intermediate holding companies and operating companies, across 21 countries.
Three countries, being the UK, Germany and Malaysia, account for the majority for the Groups results.
We accordingly focused our work on three of the reporting units in these countries, which were subject to audits of their complete financial information.
In addition, to increase our coverage of the Groups revenues and underlying profit before tax we performed audit procedures at an additional 11 reporting units located in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, America, Finland, Austria and the Czech Republic.
These components accounted for 86% of the Groups revenue, 87% of the Groups operating profit and 90% of the Groups underlying operating profit.
Where work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
The key reporting units in the UK, Germany and Malaysia were visited by senior members of the Group team during the audit.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Company financial statements Overall materiality 6.75 million 2017: 6.5 million.
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before taxation.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that underlying profit before tax, We believe that total assets is the primary being profit before tax adjusted for special measure used by the shareholders in items, is the principal metric against which assessing the performance of the company, the Groups financial performance is and is a generally accepted benchmark.
This measured in the Chairmans and CEOs has been capped at a level below that of the statements within the Annual Report.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 450,000 and 5.5 million.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 337,000 Group audit 2017: 325,000 and 337,000 Company audit 2017: 325,000 as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 CA06, ISAs UK and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below required by ISAs UK unless otherwise stated.
Synthomer plc Annual Report 2018 97 Group financial statements Independent auditors report continued to the members of Synthomer plc Strategic Report and Directors Report In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the year ended 31 December 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
CA06 In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
CA06 The directors assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: The directors confirmation on page 70 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
The directors explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group.
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors process supporting their statements: checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code : and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

The section of the Annual Report on page 69 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The directors statement relating to the companys compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors Remuneration In our opinion, the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
