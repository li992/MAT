Independent auditors report to the members of Countryside Properties PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements Opinion In our opinion: Countryside Properties PLCs Group financial statements and parent company financial statements the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Groups and of the parent companys affairs as at 30 September 2018 and of the Groups profit and cash flows for the year then ended: the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union: the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland, and applicable law : and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position as at 30 September 2018: the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended: and the notes to the financial statements, which include adescription of the significant accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK and applicable law.
Our responsibilities under ISAs UK are further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRCs Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 6 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the parent company in the period from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018.
Our audit approach Context Countryside Properties PLC is a housebuilder and urban regeneration company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group is wholly UK based, operating in London and the South East of England, and with a presence in the Midlands and North West of England through its Partnerships division: including the recently acquired Westleigh.
The Group is susceptible to external macro-economic factors such as government regulation, mortgage availability and changes in the wider building sector such as customer demand, supply chain availability and build cost inflation.
This is particularly relevant for our work in the areas of margin forecasting and the valuation of inventory.
Overview Overall Group materiality: 9.8 million 2017: 7.2 million, based on 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for non underlying items.
Overall parent company materiality: 8.0 million 2017: 6.5 million, based on 1% of total assets, restricted to an amount below the Group overall materiality.
Materiality The Group operates in two business segments, Partnerships and Housebuilding, as set out in the Annual Report refer to pages 10 to 27.
Each of the operating segments is broken down into a number of reporting units which are consolidated into the Group financial statements along with central reporting entities.
Audit scope We performed audit work over the complete financial information of 20 reporting units, including central reporting entities and the parent company which accounted for 90 per cent of the Groups revenues and 93 per cent of the Groups profit before tax, adjusted for non-underlying items.

80 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Financial statements Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Our audit approach continued The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.
In particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
We designed audit procedures at Group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and parent company financial statements, including, but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, pensions legislation and UK tax legislation.
Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation, review of correspondence with and reports to the regulators, review of correspondence with legal advisors, enquiries of management and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk ofmaterial misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Cost forecast and margin estimates Group We obtained an understanding of managements processfor preparing a site forecast and evaluated managements controls over cost forecasting and changes to forecasts.

These margins, which drive the recognition of costs as each unit is sold, reflect monthly divisional boardmeetings which gave us additional evidence over the robustness of estimated selling prices and costs for each development.

Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any sites where we considered the forecast margin to be inappropriate.
Acquisition accounting Westleigh Group We read the technical papers prepared by management in respect of the acquisition and inspected relevant contracts and information.
Management relied on an external valuation specialist to value significant intangibles acquired The Group completed the acquisition of Westleigh Group Limited, a Partnerships in business combinations.

82 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Financial statements Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Our audit approach continued How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group is comprised of two segments, Housebuilding and Partnerships.
These are then further broken down into seven operating divisions, five for Housebuilding and two for Partnerships.
Each of the divisions is broken down into a number of reporting units which also include joint ventures that are included in the Group financial statements, along with the centralised functions.
The reporting units vary in size and we identified 20 reporting units, including centralised functions and the parent company which required an audit oftheir complete financial information due to their individual size.
These 20 reporting units were all audited by the Group engagement team and, where applicable, included the audit of the joint ventures.
The reporting units where we performed an audit of the complete financial information accounted for 93 per cent of the Groups profit before tax, adjusted for non-underlying items and 90 per cent of the Groups revenue.
Our audit work at these reporting units, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level on the consolidation, goodwill, joint ventures, tax, the acquisition of the Westleigh Group, and share based payments, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group and parent company financial statements as a whole.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Group financial statements Parent company financial statements Overall Group materiality 9.8 million 2017: 7.2 million.
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for non underlying items.
1% of total assets, restricted to an amount below the Group overall materiality.
Rationale for Based on our professional judgement, we determined We believe that total assets is the primary measure used benchmark applied materiality by applying a benchmark of 5% of profit by the shareholders in assessing the position of the before tax, adjusted for non-underlying items.
We entity, and is an accepted auditing benchmark.
believe that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as it eliminates any disproportionate effect of non-underlying charges and credits and provides a consistent year-on-year basis for our work.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that was less than our overall Group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 0.8 million and 8.0 million.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 0.5 million Group audit 2017: 0.3 million and 0.5 million Parent company audit 2017: 0.3 million as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows: Reporting obligation Outcome We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.

Countryside Properties PLC Annual report 2018 83 Independent auditors report continued to the members of Countryside Properties PLC Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
TheDirectors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 CA06, ISAs UK and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below required by ISAs UK unless otherwise stated.
Strategic Report and Directors Report In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors Report for the year ended 30 September 2018 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
CA06 In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors Report.
CA06 The Directors assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: The Directors confirmation on page 39 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
The Directors explanation on page 39 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that theGroup will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group.
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors process supporting their statements: checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code : and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.
Listing Rules Other Code Provisions We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: The statement given by the Directors, on page 79, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Groups and parent companys position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and parent company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
The section of the Annual Report on pages 54 to 57 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The Directors statement relating to the parent companys compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors Remuneration In our opinion, the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
CA06 84 Annual report 2018 Countryside Properties PLC Financial statements Report on the audit of the financial statements continued Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out on page 79, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Groups and the parent companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend toliquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud orerror and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
