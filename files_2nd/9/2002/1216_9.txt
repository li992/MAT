This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the groups members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 35 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP 1 Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the UK.
A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18, Accounting policies, is set out below together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2002.
Intra-group transactions and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies The group has adopted FRS 19, Deferred taxation, in these financial statements.
The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly see note 18.
Goodwill and intangible assets Purchased goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the group is expected to benefit from it.
Goodwill amortisation periods are determined on a case-by-case basis see note 9.
Provision is made against the carrying value of goodwill where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Licences and patents purchased for the use of technology are capitalised and amortised over the period in which the group is expected to benefit from them.
These periods range from three to five years.
Trade investments Trade investments are included at cost.
There is a regular review of the carrying value of investments, with reference to relevant financial information and industry conditions: impairment charges are recorded if there is evidence of impairment in value.
Short-term investments Bank deposits, which are not repayable on demand, are treated as short-term investments in accordance with FRS 1, Cash flow statements.
Movements in such investments are included under management of liquid resources in the groups cash flow statement.
Pension scheme arrangements The group contributes to defined contribution plans, covering substantially all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated from the date that they come into use.
The principal useful economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
Turnover Turnover excluding VAT comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensed products, revenues from support, maintenance and training, and consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits.
Each licence is designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer.
Delivery generally occurs within a short time period after signing.
Licence fees are invoiced according to an agreed set of milestone payments.
Typically the first milestone is on signing of the contract, the second is on delivery of the customised technology and the third is related to acceptance of the technology by the licensee.
Revenue from the sale of licences is recognised on a  basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
The percentage to completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement, which corresponds to the costs of earned revenues.
Revenue from per-use licences is recognised when the product is accepted by the customer.
Where agreements involve multiple elements, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual elements based on each elements fair value.
Vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers where elements are sold separately.
36 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 1 Principal accounting policies continued Agreements including rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognised over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post contract support support, maintenance and training which consists of an identified customer contact at the group and telephonic or e-mail support.
Fees for post contract support which take place after customer acceptance are specified in the contract.
The fees are determined based on the groups price list as if sold separately.
The price list is established and regularly reviewed by management.
Revenue for post contract support is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the group with the licensee.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence such as off-the-shelf software are recognised upon delivery.
At that time, the group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post contract support have been accrued.
Services such as training that the group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately.
Revenue is recognised as services are performed and collectability is probable.
The excess of licence fees invoiced over revenue recognised in respect of such fees is recorded as deferred income.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the groups customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognised when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
As disclosed above, in accordance with FRS 18, Accounting policies, the group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of the  method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, customer acceptance is not uncertain.
In addition, when allocating revenue to various elements of multi-element arrangements, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation, using full provision accounting when an event has taken place by the balance sheet date which gives rise to an increased or reduced tax liability in the future in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred taxation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currency The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies are taken to reserves and reported in the statement of group total recognised gains and losses.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences have been included in operating profit.
Financial instruments The group attempts to reduce its foreign currency exposure by entering into forward contracts to sell US dollars and buy sterling.
The group accounts for these instruments by revaluing the financial instruments and the associated trade debtors and cash at the year-end rate.
The resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to the profit and loss account for the year.
Research and development All research and development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Share schemes The groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are separately administered trusts which are funded by loans the ESOP and loans and gifts the QUEST from the group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOP are shown at the lower of cost and market value.
Shares in the QUEST are shown at their estimated recoverable amount being the option price of the shares payable by employees.
The amounts contributed to the QUEST in excess of the option price are charged against reserves.
The Company operates a Save As You Earn scheme together with a similar scheme for US employees that allows the grant of share options at a discount to the market price at the date of grant.
The Company has made use of the exemption under Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 17 not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of these options.
Employers National Insurance and similar taxes arise on the exercise of certain share options.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 25 a provision is made, calculated using the market price of the Companys shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 37 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to the profit and loss account to match the projects related expenditure.
Provision for doubtful debts Provision is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.

Under legislation introduced with effect from 1 April 2002, the tax charge is affected by the availability of UK research and development tax credits.
The tax impact is a reduction in the tax charge for the year of 781,000 2001: nil.
40 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 6 Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued The current tax charge for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The differences are explained below: 2002 2001 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 45,502 50,566 Taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 30% 13,651 15,170 Effects of: Over provision in respect of prior years 63 114 Accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences 692 226 Permanent differences 267 1,143 Higher average tax rates in overseas countries 8 17 Losses utilised during the year 650 441 Current tax charge for the year 13,889 15,515 The analysis of the deferred tax asset movement for the group is as follows: Deferred Deferred tax asset tax asset 2002 2001 000 000 At 1 January 839 1,198 Credited charged to the profit and loss account 858 359 At 31 December 1,697 839 The prior years figures have been restated purely as a result of the adoption of FRS 19, Deferred taxation see note 18.

No provision is made for taxation liabilities which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries because there is no intention in the foreseeable future that such profits will be remitted.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for the amounts unprovided because of the uncertainty of utilising these losses in the future.
The Company has no potential liability for deferred taxation.
7 Profit for the financial year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 41 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company had one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year, being those share options granted to employees and directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2002 2001 Number Per share Number Per share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount 000 Thousands Pence 000 Thousands Pence Basic EPS Profit available to ordinary shareholders 32,239 1,012,295 3.2p 34,389 999,742 3.4p Effect of dilutive securities: Options 8,465 24,891 Diluted EPS Adjusted earnings 32,239 1,020,760 3.2p 34,389 1,024,633 3.4p The prior years figures have been restated solely as a result of the adoption of FRS 19, Deferred taxation, with the result that the earnings for 2001 have decreased by 268,000 and the basic EPS for 2001 has decreased by 0.1 pence.
Goodwill arising on previous years acquisitions is being written off over two years in the case of ARM France SAS, and three years in the case of Allant Software Corporation and Noral Micrologics Limited.

These are managed, respectively, through the use of hedging strategies primarily forward contracts, money market instruments and an ongoing process of assessing potential trade investments and current holdings.
To meet these objectives the group has used the policies described below which have been applied throughout the current year.
Management of foreign exchange risk The groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of the groups revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while the majority of its costs are settled in sterling.
The group seeks to use forward contracts to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the group enters into forward contracts which allow exercise between two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date.
In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the foreign exchange contract, the group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments.
It then seeks to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against forward contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the prevailing money market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time.
At 31 December 2002, the group had outstanding forward contracts to sell $54,000,000 2001: $42,800,000.
The group had $33,293,000 2001: $34,631,000 of trade debtors denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash balances of $28,645,000 2001: $22,720,000.
Thus 13% 2001: 24% of the groups US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching forward contracts at the year end, a proportion considered appropriate in the light of the anticipated US dollar requirements to settle liabilities, particularly in respect of overseas operations.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
As the amounts involved are not considered significant, the group does not take out euro forward contracts.
The group, where required, invests profits in the subsidiary in which they were earned.
The group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 45 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 15 Financial instruments continued Maximisation of return on funds held on deposit The groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
The group aims to maximise returns from funds held on deposit and uses money market deposits with major financial institutions to do so.
Recent maturities have been up to three months in length, but this varies since close consideration is given to the UK and US money market yield curves before contracts are closed.
Trade investments Investment activity is intended to create long-term strategic alliances with development companies, some of which may be unlisted at the time of the investment decision.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for these securities or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The directors review holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the group.
Funds for such ventures are strictly limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline in the value of investments would not be substantial in the context of the groups financial results.
During 2002, the group invested in Superscape plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company holds investments in four private companies, Pixim, Inc. CoWare, Inc. Palmchip Corporation and Cambridge Silicon Radio Limited, all of which develop products based on ARM technology.
External borrowings The group had no long-term debt at 31 December 2002 2001: nil or during the financial year.
Numerical disclosures Numerical disclosures are set out in the tables below.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents.
Financial liabilities Provisions for National Insurance and similar taxes of 16,000 2001: 210,000 are financial liabilities in sterling on which no interest is paid.
Maturity depends on when certain share options are exercised.
Fair values of financial instruments Cash and short-term investments The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The fair value of forward contracts is estimated at 1,061,000 at 31 December 2002 2001: 355,000.
The increase is due to changes in the sterling US dollar exchange rate in 2002.
Investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which ARM has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits.
The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the groups investments in unlisted companies carrying value at 31 December 2002: 2,729,000 as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
Nevertheless, based on impairment reviews, carried out on a regular basis, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2002.
On this basis, the fair value of the groups listed investment was equal to its carrying value at 31 December 2002 2001: no listed investments.
Provisions The carrying amount of 16,000 approximates to fair value as this is the amount which would be payable if the liability had crystallised at the balance sheet date.

Prior year adjustment The group has adopted FRS 19, Deferred taxation, during the year by means of a prior year adjustment.
The current year effect of this is to decrease the tax charge by 500,000.
The effect for 2001 is to increase the tax charge by 268,000 and to increase shareholders funds and the deferred tax debtor at 31 December 2001 by 584,000.

The group has an obligation, if certain criteria are met, to make a $3,000,000 investment representing a minority holding in a fabless semiconductor company that is set up to create and sell ARM core-based microprocessor cores to be licensed from ARM.
In 2002 a lawsuit was filed against the group claiming that the groups Jazelle technology for Java acceleration infringes a US patent.
The group is confident that its products do not infringe the patent cited in the lawsuit or any other patents, is defending the action vigorously and believes that the matter could be concluded quickly.
27 Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from disclosure available to parent companies under FRS 8, Related party disclosures, where transactions and balances between group entities have been eliminated on consolidation.
There were no related party transactions during 2002 or 2001 which require disclosure.
52 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 28 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP followed by the group and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under UK GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
The principal differences between the groups accounting policies under UK GAAP and those that would have been followed had the financial information been prepared under US GAAP are set out below.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the group is expected to benefit from it.
This was also the groups accounting policy under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, on which date, following the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen and became subject to annual impairment reviews.
The transitional impairment review carried out on adoption of SFAS 142 did not give any indication of impairment.
Acquisitions Under US GAAP, payments to purchase intangible assets that are still in development are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Such payments are included within goodwill under UK GAAP, giving rise to a difference in goodwill recognised and the associated amortisation charge.
Marketable securities Under US GAAP, investments in available-for-sale securities are marked to market where the market value is readily determinable and gains and losses, net of deferred taxation, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Under UK GAAP, the groups accounting policy is to carry such investments at cost less any provisions for diminution in value.
Investment in own shares treasury stock Under UK GAAP, the shares held by the group in the ESOP and the QUEST are included as investment in own shares within fixed asset investments.
Investment in own shares is held at the lower of cost and amounts receivable on exercise of options, where applicable, and market value.
Under US GAAP, these shares are treated as treasury stock and are included within shareholders equity, at original cost.
Save As You Earn SAYE plans Under UK GAAP, the group has taken advantage of the exemption provided by UITF 17, Employee share schemes, not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of options granted under SAYE plans.
Under US GAAP, the group follows the requirements of EITF 00-23, which does not permit such an exemption in respect of plans where the savings period is in excess of 27 months, as is the case with the groups Inland Revenue approved UK SAYE plans.
EITF 00-23 applies only to new offers made since 24 January 2002.
The compensation charge made under US GAAP is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
Employee share options Under UK GAAP, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting period of the options.
Under US GAAP such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.
Tax on US share options In the US, the group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as compensation under US tax rules for certain employee share options, which have been exercised by US employees during the year.
This amount is equivalent to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise.
Under UK GAAP the tax benefit arising from this deduction is included in the tax charge in the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the tax benefit is recorded as an increase in shareholders funds.
Embedded derivatives Under US GAAP, where the group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency that is neither the functional currency of the group nor the functional currency of the customer and where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, such derivatives are carried at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives are not revalued to fair value under UK GAAP.
Consolidated profit and loss account Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on disposal of fixed asset trade investments are shown after operating profit.
Under US GAAP, gains and losses are reported in income from operations.
Under UK GAAP, profit before tax is stated before minority interests.
Under US GAAP, income before income tax is stated after minority interests.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
These presentations differ, however, with regard to classification of items within the statements and as regards the definition of the cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash does not include short-term deposits and investments which cannot be withdrawn without notice and without incurring a penalty.
Such items are shown as short-term investments.
Under US GAAP, deposits with a maturity of less than three months at inception which are convertible into known amounts of cash are included as cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, management of liquid resources and financing activities.
US GAAP, however, requires only three categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance shown under UK GAAP are included as operating activities under US GAAP.

The matters addressed in this operating and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs high-performance, low-cost, power-efficient reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors and related technology and software, and licenses this IP to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard products ASSPs based on the ARM architecture to systems companies.
ARM also licenses and sells development systems directly to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other system designers.
ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual property-centred and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Market conditions The challenging economic environment and severe downturn in the semiconductor industry persisted throughout 2002.
In this context, ARM reported robust results in the first half of the year.
However, when the industry upturn foreseen by many commentators in the second half of 2002 did not materialize, we experienced some deferment of licensing decisions by our Partners and a consequent slowdown in licensing activity.
The slowdown continues to persist.
This slowdown in licensing activity caused us to realign our expectations for shortto medium-term revenue growth and we took the decision to adjust our cost base to be commensurate with our revised expectations.
Despite the unhelpful market background, we continue to invest in the future ARM technology roadmap by maintaining a high level of research and development expenditure and are, therefore, particularly pleased that even with a slowdown in licensing activity in the second half we remain strongly profitable and cash generative.
Indeed, in the second half alone the total net cash inflow from operating activities was 30.8 million, giving rise to a year end cash balance of over 130 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of income.
Year ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 %% % Revenues: Product revenues 83.9 87.5 88.1 Service revenues 16.1 12.5 11.9 Total revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Product costs 4.6 5.6 4.3 Service costs 7.0 6.2 4.4 Total cost of revenues 11.6 11.8 8.7 Gross profit 88.4 88.2 91.3 Operating expenses: Research and development 26.2 25.3 31.3 Sales and marketing 17.7 14.7 16.4 General and administrative 12.2 15.4 14.9 Amortization of goodwill 1.3 1.3 Restructuring costs 1.3 Total operating expenses 57.4 56.7 63.9 Income from operations 31.0 31.5 27.4 Interest, net 3.9 3.1 2.9 Share of loss of equity affiliate 0.1 Gain on partial disposal of equity affiliate 0.5 Minority interest 0.2 0.2 0.2 Income before income tax 35.1 34.4 30.1 Provision for income taxes 6.0 11.1 9.1 Net income 29.1 23.3 21.0 Total revenues Total revenues were 150.9 million in 2002, an increase of 3% from 146.3 million in 2001, which was a 45% increase from 100.7 million in 2000.
Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties.
Product revenues for 2000, 2001 and 2002 were 84.6 million, 128.0 million and 133.0 million, representing 84%, 87% and 88% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues increased from 45.4 million in 2000 to 76.8 million in 2001 and to 83.0 million in 2002 representing approximately 45%, 52% and 55% of total revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
The importance of the ARM7 family declined further in 2002, accounting for 36% of revenues in 2000, 20% in 2001 and 15% in 2002.
This continuing decline reflected the growing range of products available to license from the Company, including ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 57 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued a broadening number of ARM9 and ARM10 core family products, the first core in the ARM11 family of products and architectural licenses which give licensees more rights to modify the technology, peripheral technology, models, sub-systems and application software.
Revenues from the ARM9 family have become increasingly important, accounting for 31% of revenues in 2000, 44% in 2001 and 43% in 2002.
33 new licensees were signed in 2002 bringing the total number of semiconductor Partners to 108.
Of the 33 new licensees, 23 were per-use licensees who joined the Foundry Programme, introduced in 2000 to enable small fabless chip companies to gain access to the Companys technology at a lower price point.
Existing semiconductor Partners licensed further cores in 2002 with 37 separate products licensed by 25 different Partners during the year.
Of these, 21 were for products from microprocessor core families not previously licensed, and 16 were for further cores within families already licensed.
Sales of licenses to the existing customer base of semiconductor Partners has become a more important part of the business, accounting for approximately 89% of total license fees in 2002: this compares to approximately 80% in 2001 and 66% in 2000.
The sale of non-core licenses, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, models, and sub-systems, increased in 2002 to 12.6 million from 11.9 million in 2001 and 7.8 million in 2000 representing approximately 15% of license revenues in 2002, 15% in 2001 and 17% in 2000.
Revenues from the sale of Development Systems increased from 13.6 million in 2000 to 23.3 million in 2001, falling slightly to 23.1 million in 2002 representing approximately 14%, 16% and 15% of total revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
The majority of ARMs sales of Development Systems are in US dollars and the US dollar value of sales of development systems in 2002 was approximately 3% higher than in 2001.
The effect of the strong pound against the US dollar was to reduce the sterling value of sales.
Sales of Development Systems were also affected by increased competition in the debug tools marketplace, which saw the volume of sales of ARMs debug solutions increasing, but the value of sales decreasing as prices were cut to remain competitive.
Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensees net sales price per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales.
In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data is received and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the current year.
Royalties increased from 25.6 million in 2000, to 27.9 million in 2001, and decreased to 26.8 million in 2002, representing 25%, 19% and 18% of total revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
Volume shipments increased from 367 million units in 2000, to 420 million units in 2001, mainly due to an increase in the sale of products such as printers, digital cameras, smart cards, disk drives and networking products.
Unit shipments in 2002 were 456 million, with the increase in volumes coming from increased production of a wide range of electronic devices, including wireless handsets, secure products and automotive products.
The Company expects royalty revenues to grow year on year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
The proportion of unit shipments into the non-wireless markets has increased in 2002 and the Company expects this trend to continue into 2003.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training.
Service revenues increased from 16.2 million in 2000, to 18.3 million in 2001, and decreased to 18.0 million in 2002, representing 16%, 13% and 12% of total revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
Consulting revenues decreased from 8.2 million in 2000, to 7.4 million in 2001, and 4.4 million in 2002, as engineering resource was directed away from consulting projects to research and development activities.
Revenues from support, maintenance and training increased from 8.0 million in 2000 to 10.9 million in 2001 and 13.5 million in 2002.
Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Companys revenues fluctuate from period to period depending upon the country of origin of its customers.
The pattern of revenues in 2002 was 44% of revenues coming from the US, 25% from Japan, 13% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 18% from Europe.
In 2001, revenues from the US represented 49%, Japan 23%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 9%, and Europe 19%.
In 2000, 55% of revenues came from the US, 18% from Japan, 7% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 20% from Europe.
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of development systems and costs incurred in making third-party operating systems compatible with the ARM architecture.
Product costs were 4.6 million in 2000, 8.2 million in 2001 and 6.5 million in 2002 representing 5%, 6% and 4% of total revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
Approximately two-thirds of total product cost of sales were made up of development systems costs in 2002, with the balance comprising additional costs related to the costs of third-party operating systems.
This compares to approximately four-fifths of total product cost of sales being made up of development systems costs in 2000 and 2001, with the balance being costs associated with third-party operating systems.
Product gross margin in 2002 increased slightly to 95%, compared to 94% in 2001 and 95% in 2000.
The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in product costs in 2003, although this would be subject to significant fluctuations if management were obliged to port further operating systems to run on the ARM architecture.
Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to consulting work performed for third parties.
Cost of services increased from approximately 7.1 million in 2000 to 9.1 million in 2001, and fell to 6.7 million in 2002.
The gross margins earned on service revenues were approximately 56% in 2000, 50% in 2001, and 63% in 2002.
The gross margin increased in 2002 due to a shift in engineering resource from low-margin consulting projects to more profitable IP-generating activities.
Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from 26.4 million in 2000 to 36.9 million in 2001, and 47.3 million in 2002, representing 26%, 25% and 31% of total revenues in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.
Continued investment in research and development remains an essential part of the Companys strategy since its development of new products to license is key to its success.
Current projects include the development of additional versions of the ARM11 core and platform, first implementations of ARMs intelligent energy management technology, additions to the PrimeXsys range of system IP platforms, research into future microprocessor architectures, multi-processing solutions and enhanced application software and development systems products.
Total engineering headcount increased from 376 at the end of 2000 to 429 at the end of 2001, and was 420 at the end of 2002.
In addition, there were approximately 15 contractors in 2000, 18 in 2001 and 18 in 2002.
58 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure increased from 17.8 million in 2000, to 21.5 million in 2001, and 24.7 million in 2002, representing 18% of total revenues in 2000, 15% in 2001, and 16% in 2002.
Headcount in this area increased from 162 at December 31, 2000, to 198 at December 31, 2001, and 208 at December 31, 2002.
The total number of offices with sales people is currently 14 and this enables improved contact with the Companys geographically diverse customer base.
In 2001, a further sales office was opened in the US and in 2002 a sales office was opened in Shanghai, PR China.
General and administrative General and administrative headcount increased from 81 at December 31, 2000, to 95 at December 31, 2001, and was 93 at December 31, 2002.
General and administrative costs rose from 12.3 million in 2000 to 22.5 million in 2001 and were 22.5 million in 2002, representing 12%, 15% and 15% of total revenues, respectively.
In 2001, legal costs increased to 5.5 million, largely attributable to the Companys now-resolved litigation against picoTurbo Inc. human resources costs grew by 2 million, with greater emphasis on employee training, and establishment costs rose by 1 million with improved office accommodation.
In 2002, Nazomi Communications, Inc. filed a lawsuit against ARM before the Federal District Court for Northern California claiming that ARMs Jazelle technology for Java acceleration infringes a US patent owned by Nazomi.
ARM is confident that its products do not infringe the patent cited in the lawsuit or any other Nazomi patents.
Total legal costs were 4.1 million in 2002.
Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts was 1.4 million in 2002, compared to 0.7 million in 2001 and a release of provision of 0.2 million in 2000, reflecting more difficult trading conditions for many of our smaller customers.
Unrealized future foreign exchange losses on certain committed but not yet invoiced future revenue streams of 0.9 million 2001: nil: 2000: nil were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133.
There was a gain on foreign exchange of 0.1 million in 2000, an exchange loss of 0.2 million in 2001 and an exchange gain of 0.5 million in 2002.
See Foreign Currency Fluctuations below.
Restructuring costs During 2002, the Company incurred restructuring costs of 2.0 million comprising mainly severance payments, all of which were paid during the fourth quarter following a reduction in total headcount of 98 people representing 12% of the Companys workforce.
It is anticipated that this reduction in the workforce will reduce employee costs by approximately 5 million per annum.
Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets The Company purchased the assets of Infinite Designs Limited in March 2000, EuroMIPS Systems SAS in June 2000 and Allant Software Corporation in September 2000.
In 2001, the Company purchased the assets of Noral Micrologics Limited, a ten-person company with expertise in debugging software, for a consideration of 1.4 million.
Amortization of goodwill of 1.9 million was charged to the income statement in 2001 and 1.3 million was charged in 2000.
In-process research and development costs of 0.2 million relating to the acquisition of Allant Software Corporation were written off in 2000.
There was no charge for goodwill in 2002 following the Companys adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets.
During 2000 a license connected with the rights to use a certain debugging technology for use in the Companys development systems products was purchased for 2.8 million.
This is being amortized over a period of three years with 0.9 million 2001: 0.9 million, 2000: 0.2 million amortized during 2002.
The Company also purchased a new license for 1.1 million in 2001 to enable the Company to produce and license Java technology-related products.
This is being amortized over a period of five years with 0.2 million amortized during 2001 and 0.2 million amortized during 2002.
A further license was purchased in 2002 for 0.2 million.
This is being amortized over three years.
Following the conclusion of the Companys litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights to the Company for a payment of 7.5 million.
This is being amortized over five years and 1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002.
The Company also purchased a patent for 0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years.
The amortization charge for 2002 was 0.1 million.
The adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, has not resulted in any impairment of the Companys goodwill or intangible assets.
Interest Interest grew from 3.9 million in 2000 to 4.5 million in 2001 and was 4.3 million in 2002.
The growth in interest earned between 2000 and 2001 was lower than the growth in cash balances, and interest earned fell slightly between 2001 and 2002 reflecting the drop in market interest rates during 2001 and 2002.
The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to three months during 2002.
Income before income tax Income before income tax grew from 35.4 million in 2000 to 50.3 million in 2001 and was 45.4 million in 2002, representing 35%, 34% and 30% of total revenues respectively.
The slight drop in margins between 2000 and 2001 was partly due to lower returns on cash deposits.
The drop in margins in 2002 was a result of lower than anticipated revenues in the second half of the year.
Tax charge The Companys effective tax rates were 17% in 2000, 32% in 2001 and 30% in 2002.
The principal reason for the lower tax rate in 2000 was the establishment of a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST, a trust set up to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
The contribution by the Company to the QUEST for the purchase of shares by the QUEST is a tax-deductible expense under existing UK tax legislation.
The Company made two contributions to the QUEST in March 2000 and November 2000, when the QUEST purchased 1,483,440 shares and 559,559 shares respectively.
The Company did not make further contributions to the QUEST in 2001 or 2002 and so the tax rate returned to normal levels.
Full details with respect to the QUEST are disclosed in footnote 1 of the financial statements.
Liquidity and capital resources The Companys operating activities provided net cash of 42.7 million, 52.0 million and 39.5 million in 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
In 2000 the significant items impacting on cash generated from operations were the increase in accounts receivable of 4.7 million and the increase in deferred revenue of 5.1 million.
In 2001, accounts receivable increased a further 6.6 million while deferred revenues grew by 6.7 million and in 2002 accounts receivable decreased by 2.9 million and deferred revenues fell by 5.0 million.
In 2002 prepaid expenses increased by 5.3 million, compared to an increase of 1.4 million and 1.0 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company entered into several leases for design automation tools during 2002, which resulted in the large increase in prepaid expenses.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 59 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued At December 31, 2002, the Company recorded approximately 14.4 million in deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be recognized as revenues in varying amounts after December 31, 2002.
At December 31, 2001, and December 31, 2000, the Company recorded approximately 19.4 million and 12.7 million respectively in deferred revenues.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure in 2002 was 15.6 million, compared to 17.3 million in 2001 and 11.8 million in 2000.
The increasing expenditures between 2000 and 2001 were due to the need to invest in new design automation tools for a rapidly expanding workforce and the costs of establishing and improving the Companys design centers in the UK, France and the US.
In 2002, capital expenditure decreased as a result of the Company leasing some of the design automation tools that would have previously been purchased.
In 2000, 4.7 million was spent on improvements to offices.
Further investment was made in design tools in the UK and the US with 6.6 million being spent on computers and software.
In 2001, 4.0 million was spent on office improvements with 13.4 million spent on computer equipment and software.
In 2002, 15.6 million was spent on computer equipment, software, leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
During 2000, the Company purchased the entire share capital of EuroMIPS Systems SAS now ARM France SAS and Allant Software Corporation, and the trade and assets of Infinite Designs Limited.
The aggregate sum paid for these three acquisitions amounted to 3.4 million.
In 2001, the Company purchased part of the business of Noral Micrologics Limited for 1.4 million in cash.
The Company envisages making strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can broaden its product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved significantly.
During 1996, the Company made two investments in small start-up companies, namely Sirius Communications NV and Palmchip Corporation Palmchip.
These investments amounted to 0.2 million in aggregate.
In 1997, the Company made a further investment in Palmchip and converted its existing loan to give the Company a 45% shareholding.
During 2000 the Company disposed of part of its share in Palmchip for 0.5 million with the result that it was no longer treated as an equity affiliate.
The Companys share of the loss of Palmchip up to the disposal date was 0.1 million.
During 2000, the Company made the following investments in available-for-sale securities: 1.3 million in Parthus Technologies plc, 0.7 million in Cambridge Silicon Radio Limited, and 2.1 million in CoWare, Inc.
In 2001, the Company made the following investments in available-for-sale securities: 0.3 million in LinkUp Systems, Inc. and 1.0 million in Pixim, Inc.
In addition, in 2001 the Company sold its investment in Parthus for a profit of 0.1 million, and its investment in Sirius Communications NV for a profit of 0.5 million.
It recognized a loss on its investment in LinkUp Systems of 0.3 million at the end of 2001 when LinkUps entire business was purchased by a third party.
In 2002, the Company made one investment in an available-for-sale security, namely Superscape plc, for a consideration of 1.5 million.
Cash balances at December 31, 2002, were 130.3 million compared to 104.5 million at December 31, 2001.
At December 31, 2001, accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful debts were 24.8 million and 20.5 million at December 31, 2002, which represented 17% and 14% of revenues, respectively.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Companys earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Companys revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are in sterling.
The Company reduces this US dollar sterling risk where possible by currency hedging.
Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual licenses and the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a  basis.
It then hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks.
The average size of each forward contract was $3.5 million in 2000, $3.0 million in 2001, and $7.2 million in 2002.
The Company does not currently use any other financial instruments or derivatives, although the Company is reviewing the use of other financial instruments such as currency options.
The fair values of the financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 are disclosed in footnote 12 to the financial statements.
The settlement period of the forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 is between January 17 and March 24, 2003.
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
The Company believes that its future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors.
These include the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Companys semiconductor Partners and sudden technological change in the microprocessor industry.
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor Partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees, management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions.
Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Companys annual report on Form 20-F for 2002.

64 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Company design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard processors ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilize the Companys technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Company also licenses and sells development systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Companys principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.

Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in British sterling.
Purely for the convenience of the reader, the December 31, 2002, consolidated financial statements have been translated from sterling at the closing rate on December 31, 2002, of 1.00 $1.610.
Such translations should not be construed as representations that the sterling amounts represent, or have been or could be so converted into US dollars at that rate or at any other rate.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Equity affiliates Companies in which the Company owns between 20% and 50% of the voting stock are treated as equity affiliates.
During 2000, the Company made a partial disposal of its holding in Palmchip Corporation with the result that the remaining holding is below 20% and is, therefore, treated as an available-for-sale security.
The consolidated statements of income include the groups share of net income of equity affiliates up to the date of the partial disposal.
The remaining investment is included in the consolidated balance sheet at the value of the groups share of net assets at the date of disposal.
The group had no equity affiliates at December 31, 2001, or at December 31, 2002.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
115, Accounting for certain investments in debt and securities and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity.
Realized gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value: at December 31, 2002 and 2001, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management.
The Company invested in two unlisted companies during 2000, one of which was a 3.5% investment in the share capital of CoWare, Inc. a company which develops system-on-chip software for a wide range of applications, and the other was a less than 1% investment in the share capital of Cambridge Silicon Radio Limited, an intellectual property company which develops Bluetooth solutions.
Two further trade investments were made in 2001, one of which was a 1.7% investment in Pixim, Inc. and the other was a 1.3% investment in LinkUp Systems, Inc.
Both of these are fabless chip companies based in California.
Equity shares in both companies were received in settlement of accounts receivable.
The Company sold its 3% stake in Sirius Communications NV during 2001.
The Company made an investment in Parthus Technologies plc during 2000.
This company, although unlisted at the time of investment, subsequently floated on the London Stock Exchange, and was included in the 2000 consolidated balance sheet at market value at the balance sheet date.
This investment was disposed of in its entirety in 2001.
During 2002, the Company made an 11.99% investment in Superscape plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them.
An independent valuation is made of any in-process research and development on acquisition and the amount written off immediately.
One such project was acquired during the year to December 31, 2000, and was independently valued at 150,000.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 65 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from it.
Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on January 1, 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill.
The value of goodwill carried forward at the end of 2001 has been frozen at 2,274,000 and goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually.
The Company has completed the transitional impairment review upon adoption of SFAS 142 January 1, 2002 and determined that there is no indication of impairment with respect to goodwill.
Impairment charges The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would be recognized, and the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the Companys intellectual property IP, which is customized to each customers manufacturing process.
The Company receives royalties on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and consultancy services.
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, ASICs and ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
The Companys IP consists of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software.
Most licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application.
In general, the time between the signing of a license and final customer acceptance is between six and 15 months.
Upgrades or modifications to the licensed IP are not provided.
Following customer acceptance, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
Revenue from per-use licenses is recognized when the product is accepted by the customer.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts, when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, contract accounting is applied.
Revenues from license fees are recognized based on the  method over the period from signing of the license to customer acceptance and the completion of all outstanding obligations.
The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement and the percentage to completion achieved.
The percentage to completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Revenues are recognized only when collectability is probable.
Estimates of total project requirement are based on prior experience of customization, delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
In accordance with SOP 97-2, Software revenue recognition, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require significant production, modification or customization, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual elements based on each elements relative fair value.
Revenue for each element is then recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for that element is met.
In addition to the license fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post contract support support and maintenance PCS which consists of an identified customer contact at the Company, and telephone or e-mail support.
Revenue related to PCS is recognized based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE, determined based on the price of PCS when sold separately.
Revenue for PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Company with the licensee.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery.
Where necessary, and in the circumstances permitted by SOP 97-2, the costs associated with providing post contract support have been accrued.
Services, such as consulting and training, which are not essential to the functionality of the IP, are accounted for separately based on VSOE.
Revenue is recognized as services are performed and collectability is probable.
The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognized when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, is recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For longer-term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenue is recognized on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
This method approximates to percentage to completion based on labor inputs.
Restructuring costs Restructuring costs include the cost of redundancy payments to 98 employees and the cost of outplacement services.
66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Advertising costs All advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European Union.
The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements.
Grants received are intended to cover 50% of expected project costs.
Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred.
Unconditional undertakings have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received.
Amounts receivable under these arrangements in the year ended December 31, 2002 were 199,000 2001: 268,000: 2000: 186,000 and were netted against related research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 were 1,160,000, 1,591,000, and 1,894,000 respectively.
Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Currency translation The functional currency for the Companys operations is the local currency in which it operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
Translation differences are taken to the cumulative translation adjustment.
The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Companys forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
Because the Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the income statement.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Company nor the functional currency of the customer.
In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement under general and administrative costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2002 the loss on exchange is 950,000 2001: nil: 2000: nil.
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 67 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The diluted share base for the year ended December 31, 2002, excludes incremental shares of approximately 19,608,000 2001: 6,258,000: 2000: 274,000 related to employee stock options.
These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
The ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee stock-based compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations.
Stock-based employee compensation cost in respect of certain SAYE options see below of 56,000 is reflected in net income.
No compensation cost is recorded in respect of the other stock option plans, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Apart from options issued to certain executive directors, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options.
For executive directors, discretionary share options of up to two times base salary may be issued each year that will vest after seven years.
If, however, the Company achieves fully diluted EPS growth of 33.1% above the rate of inflation over a period of three years, then all the options are exercisable after three years.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for stock-based compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.
Year ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 000 000 000 Net income: As reported 29,377 34,002 31,637 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 8,265 11,610 11,165 Add back: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under the intrinsic value-based method 56 Pro forma net income 21,112 22,392 20,528 Basic earnings per common share pence : As reported 3.0p 3.4p 3.1p Pro forma 2.2p 2.2p 2.0p Diluted earnings per common share pence : As reported 2.9p 3.3p 3.1p Pro forma 2.1p 2.2p 2.0p The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000: risk-free interest rate of 5.1% 2001: 5.1%: 2000: 6.0% : expected life of four years: 80% 2001: 79%: 2000: 74% volatility: and no dividends.
The Company operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under these schemes are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the savings period must be at least 36 months.
During the year, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus, contained within EITF 00-23, that savings plans which have a savings period in excess of 27 months should be treated as compensatory.
In accordance with EITF 00-23, which applies to new offers after January 24, 2002, the Company has recognized a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans offered since that date.
The compensation charge is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
The compensation charge recorded in 2002 is 56,000.
The deferred compensation at December 31, 2002 was 313,000.
In addition, the EITF reached a consensus that an employers offer to enter into a new SAYE contract at a lower price than an existing contract causes variable accounting for all existing awards subject to the offer.
Variable accounting commences for all existing awards when the offer is made, and for those awards that are retained by employees because the offer is declined, variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, or expire unexercised.
New awards are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are canceled.
The compensation charge recorded in 2002 as a result of these provisions is nil.
The number of options to which variable accounting applies is approximately 980,000.
Employee share ownership plans Treasury stock represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust ESOP and the QUEST.
The ESOP was set up on April 16, 1998, to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees.
No options had been granted over these shares and no shares had been allocated at December 31, 2002.
The market value of unearned shares at December 31, 2002, was approximately 240,000.
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.
For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they vest unconditionally.
68 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Treasury stock held also includes 728,000 relating to 1,796,754 shares held by the Companys QUEST, which was established by the Company during 1999.
The Company established the QUEST to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
No shares were purchased in 2002 or 2001.
In 2000 2,042,999 shares were purchased as detailed below.
On March 13, 2000, and November 7, 2000, the Company provided 14,445,000 and 4,291,000 respectively of which 14,018,000 and 3,769,000 respectively, being 17,787,000 in total, was by way of a gift, and 427,000 and 522,000 respectively, being 949,000 in total, was by way of a loan.
On the same dates, the QUEST subscribed at market value for 1,483,440 and 559,559 respectively of the Companys 0.05 pence ordinary shares.
The shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares.
They will be allocated to employees and directors to satisfy their options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes.
The cost of all the shares has been treated as treasury stock.
The excess of the subscription price over the nominal value, which amounts to 718,082, has been taken to additional paid-in capital.
During 2002, 220,846 shares 2001: 3,925,400 were allocated from the QUEST following the exercise of share options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes.
Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the income statement as they accrue.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions.
In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employers taxes on these share options.
These amounts will be recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No.
146 SFAS 146, Accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities.
SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF 94-3, Liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring.
SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan.
SFAS 146 states that a commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability.
Therefore, SFAS 146 eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in EITF 94-3.
It also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability.
SFAS 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.
Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
45 FIN 45, Guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others.
FIN 45 requires the guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.
It also elaborates on the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligation under certain guarantees that it has issued and to be made in regard of product warranties.
The initial recognition and movement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002: while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002.
Management does not expect the adoption of FIN 45 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 00-21, Accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
This Issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities.
Specifically, the Issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement.
The provisions of this Issue are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, with early application permitted.
Management is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this Issue will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of variable interest entities.
FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51, Consolidated financial statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date.
It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.
FIN 46 applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period.
Management does not expect the adoption of FIN 46 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Companies Act 1985 These financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 of Great Britain the Companies Act.
The Companys statutory accounts, which are its primary financial statements, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP in compliance with the Companies Act and are presented in pounds sterling.
Statutory accounts upon which the auditors gave unqualified reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act and which did not contain statements under subsections 237 2 and 3 of the Companies Act for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 have been, and those for the year ended December 31, 2002, will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
Dividends are required to be declared in sterling out of profits available for that purpose as determined in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 69 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 2 Related party transactions Until the partial disposal of Palmchip Corporation in 2000, the directors regarded Palmchip as a related party by virtue of its being an associated undertaking: in 2000, prior to the partial disposal, Palmchip repaid a loan of 248,000 previously made to it by ARM Limited.

Such benefits are reflected as additional paid-in capital.
The taxation charge in 2000 was reduced by 5,331,000 following a payment of 17,787,000 to the QUEST detailed in footnote 1.
There were no payments to the QUEST in 2001 or 2002.
Total income tax expense differs from the amounts computed by applying the UK statutory income tax rate of 30% for 2002, 2001 and 2000 to income before income tax as a result of the following: Year ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 000 000 000 UK statutory rate 30% 2001: 30%: 2000: 30% 10,615 15,091 13,627 Permanent differences arising on payment to QUEST 5,331 Permanent differences other 690 1,150 186 Differences in statutory rates of foreign countries 53 99 115 Other, net 20 38 143 6,007 16,302 13,785 Permanent differences comprise permanent adjustments, non-deductible stock option compensation and the UK research and development tax credit.

If these earnings were to be remitted without offsetting tax credits in the UK withholding taxes would be approximately 518,000 2001: 385,000: 2000: 232,000.
The valuation allowance relates to net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believe it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized.
None of the loss carryforwards expires before 2018.

Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the Companys customers are large, well-established companies.
The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
For further information see footnote 11.
At December 31, 2001 and 2002 no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
At December 31, 2000, one customer accounted for 10.4% of accounts receivable.
As of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Companys cash and cash equivalents were deposited with major clearing banks in the UK in the form of money market deposits for varying periods of up to three months.
72 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 6 Investments On February 1, 2001, the Company purchased part of the business and assets of Noral Micrologics Limited for cash consideration of 1,351,000.
The purchase consideration has all been treated as goodwill, as the book and fair value of the assets acquired was negligible.
On June 21, 2000, all of the issued share capital of EuroMIPS Systems SAS now ARM France SAS was purchased for cash consideration of 864,000: and on September 18, 2000, all of the issued share capital of Allant Software Corporation was purchased for cash consideration of 2,193,000.
Further to the cash consideration for the cost of the acquisitions, the acquisition agreements provide for cash bonuses and payments for post-acquisition pre-defined services provided by employees.
These are being treated as payroll costs of the periods to which the services relate.
Following a detailed review of the acquired companies balance sheets and their accounting policies it was considered that no fair value adjustments were necessary.
Following an independent valuation of the in-process research and development acquired with Allant Software Corporation, 150,000 was written off through the income statement to research and development.
The combinations have been accounted for using the purchase method.
Unaudited pro forma results of the Company and the acquired businesses have not been presented as the acquired businesses are immaterial to the Companys results.
In 2002, the Company invested 1,500,000 in Superscape plc, an available-for-sale investment.
In 2001, the Company disposed of two available-for-sale investments realizing a gain of 655,000.
In March 2000, the Company disposed of part of its shareholding in Palmchip Corporation, reducing its holding from 45.4% to 4.9%.
The Company recognized a 512,000 profit on the sale of these shares.
Impairments during 2002 against unlisted investments held at the year end amounted to 826,000 2001: 613,000.

Until the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 see footnote 1, goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to three years, determined in each case by reference to employee turnover rates in the industry and the individual technology acquired with the acquisitions.
In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years.
The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over five years, being the period over which the Company will derive benefit from them.
The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets in each of the next five years is set forth below: 000 2003 2,617 2004 1,881 2005 1,862 2006 1,738 2007 45 74 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 9 Shareholders equity Share capital There was a share split in April 2000.
Shareholders received five shares with a nominal value of 0.05 pence per share for every one share held with a nominal value of 0.25 pence.
Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Approved Incentive Share Option Plan the Approved Scheme, the Company may grant options to directors and employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Approved Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Executive Scheme the Executive Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Share Option Plan, which is substantially the same as the Executive Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM, INC. where the period is two years.
The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM, INC. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The Company set up two further savings related option schemes in each of 2000, 2001 and 2002 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.
Option activity is summarized as follows: Outstanding options Weighted average Shares exercise price Number Balances, December 31, 1999 80,814,215 0.318 Granted in year 5,867,630 6.171 Lapsed in year 1,341,025 1.884 Exercised in year 38,338,347 0.060 Balances, December 31, 2000 47,002,473 1.214 Granted in year 8,189,032 3.398 Lapsed in year 1,283,752 3.433 Exercised in year 18,457,205 0.136 Balances, December 31, 2001 35,450,548 2.199 Granted in year 10,081,501 2.290 Lapsed in year 3,269,030 1.965 Exercised in year 7,211,670 0.691 Balances, December 31, 2002 35,051,349 2.557 The weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during 2002 was 2.34 for executive options and 1.83 for sharesave options.
The weighted average exercise price of options exercisable at December 31, 2002 was 1.71 December 31, 2001: 1.03.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had three share option plans and seven savings-related share option schemes.
The Company applies APB Opinion No.
25 and related interpretations in accounting for its plans.
10 Commitments and contingencies The Company leases its office facilities and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements which expire at various dates through 2018.
Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2002, are as follows: Operating leases Years ending December 31 000 2003 5,149 2004 4,791 2005 3,054 2006 2,250 2007 2,110 Thereafter 17,682 Total minimum lease payments 35,036 Rental expense under operating leases totaled 2,746,000, 3,101,000 and 5,199,000 for the years ended December 31 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
The Company has an obligation, if certain criteria are met, to make a $3,000,000 investment, representing a minority holding in a fabless semiconductor company set up to create and sell ARM core-based microprocessor cores to be licensed from ARM.
In 2002, a lawsuit was filed against the Company claiming that the Companys Jazelle technology for Java acceleration infringes a US patent.
The Company is confident that its products do not infringe the patent cited in the lawsuit or any other patents, is defending the action vigorously and believes that the matter could be concluded quickly.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 77 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 11 Geographic and segment information The Company operates in, and is managed as, a single product segment.
The following analysis is of revenues by geographic segment and origin and long-lived assets by group companies in each territory: Year ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 000 000 000 Revenues by market destination : Europe 20,616 27,103 26,731 US 55,233 72,271 67,087 Japan 18,007 33,548 38,294 Asia Pacific excluding Japan 6,874 13,352 18,810 Total revenues 100,730 146,274 150,922 The Companys exports from the United Kingdom were 87,096,000, 128,303,000 and 135,713,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 respectively.
In 2000, one US customer accounted for 15% of total revenues.
12 Fair values of financial instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows: Year ended December 31 2000 2001 2002 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value amount value 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 75,266 75,266 104,467 104,467 130,304 130,304 Accounts receivable 18,913 18,913 24,809 24,809 20,516 20,516 Foreign currency contracts 551 551 355 355 1,061 1,061 Embedded derivatives 950 950 78 ARM Annual report and accounts 2002 Report of independent accountants US GAAP To the board of directors and shareholders of ARM Holdings plc In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders equity and of cash flow present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management: our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion expressed above.
