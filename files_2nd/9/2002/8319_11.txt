ANNUAL REPORT 2002 49 Statement of Directors responsibilities In respect of the preparation of the financial statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the statement of auditors responsibilities included in their report below, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and auditors in relation to the financial statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Independent auditors report To the members of International Power plc We have audited the financial statements on pages 50 to 79.
We have also audited the information in the Directors remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Directors remuneration report.
As described above, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditor, are established in the UK by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and by our professions ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement on page 25 reects the Companys compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the Directors remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2002 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended: the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The ESPS is divided into sections, and the International Power Group of ESPS was opened to members on 1 April 2002.
Prior to this date, International Power plc staff, who were former employees of National Power, participated in the Innogy section of the ESPS and employees taken on in the Rugeley acquisition participated in another section of the ESPS, the Eastern Electricity section.
During the first quarter of 2002, contributions were paid to the Innogy Group based on the latest actuarial valuation of that Group.
The contributions paid during the quarter amounted to 0.15 million.
Also during the first quarter of 2002, contributions amounting to 0.12 million were paid to the Eastern Electricity section based on the terms agreed in that acquisition.
Since 1 April 2002, International Power has paid contributions to the International Power Group of ESPS to cover new benefit accrual, as advised by the actuary.
These contributions amounted to 1.7 million.
Transfer payments totalling 19.8 million were received from the Innogy section of the ESPS in October and November 2002.
The total transfer payment related to employees pension benets built up in the Innogy Group of ESPS prior to 1 April 2002 and was calculated on a share of fund basis as set out in the actuarys memorandum from the Demerger Agreement.
A further transfer payment of 10.5 million was received from the Eastern Electricity section of the ESPS.
This payment was based on the assumptions agreed as part of the Rugeley acquisition.
The first full valuation of the International Power Group of ESPS will be carried out as at 31 March 2003 at which any difference between assets and accrued liabilities will be addressed.
Employees at Hazelwood participate in a standard Australian superannuation fund called Equipsuper.
This plan provides benets primarily for employees in the electricity, gas and water industry, and was developed from the scheme sponsored by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria.
At 31 December 2002, the market value of assets was 101% of accrued liabilities.
The assets were 40 million and liabilities 39 million.
The pension cost for 2002 was 1 million.
The principal assumptions are set out below: Valuation date 31 December 2002 Principal assumptions: Investment return 7.5% pa Salary increases 5.0% pa Pensions increases n a In other countries employees are members of local social security schemes and in some cases dened contribution plans.
ANNUAL REPORT 2002 61 FRS17 In accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benets, this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the schemes and the fair value of assets held.
However, as permitted by FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the financial statements continue to be reported under the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
International Power operates dened benefit schemes in the UK and Australia.

Convertible bonds On 24 November 2000, International Power Cayman Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, issued US$357 million 2% convertible notes due 2005, convertible into preference shares of International Power Cayman Limited at the holders option, exchangeable for Ordinary Shares of, and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by International Power plc.
The notes are convertible into Ordinary Shares of International Power plc at a conversion price of 300p at any time between 4 January 2001 and 23 November 2005.
Each US$1,000 principal amount of notes will entitle the holder to convert into a US$1,000 paid up value of preference shares of International Power Cayman Limited.
Investors may elect to receive their Ordinary Shares in the form of American Depositary Receipts.
The notes may be redeemed at the holders option at a redemption price of 107.1% of its principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, on 24 November 2003.
If the conversion option is not exercised, the convertible unsecured notes will be redeemed on 24 November 2005 at a redemption price of 112.4% of its principal amount.
Provision is made for the possible premium on redemption and included within the carrying amount of the bonds.
At 31 December 2002, the amount accrued was 13 million 31 December 2001: 6 million.
The finance cost charged in the profit and loss account comprises the aggregate of the coupon on the convertible unsecured notes and the proportion of the premium on redemption that relates to the financial year.
As the conversion exercise price is substantially above the present share price, it is likely that the bondholders will exercise their right.
Accordingly, the convertible bond is now shown wthin short-term liabilities.
Secured loans without recourse We are in discussions with bank groups in relation to non-recourse debt for Rugeley and the US merchant asset portfolio.
Until these issues are resolved and documented, the debt at Rugeley and ANP is reported as current non-recourse debt in our accounts.
Secured bank loans without recourse are those where the obligation to repay lies solely with the subsidiary and are secured solely on the assets of the subsidiary concerned.

In addition, the Group has made minor acquisitions and made final payments in respect of past acquisitions during 2002.
These have had an insignicant impact on the cash ows of the Group.

Financial instruments comprise net debt see note 25 together with other instruments deemed to be financial instruments including long-term debtors and creditors and provisions for liabilities and charges.
a Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures other than the currency risk disclosures as relevant.
The fair value of short-term debtors and creditors approximates to the carrying value because of their short maturity.
In accordance with FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments, deferred tax has been excluded from the following disclosures.
b Interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities The interest rate prole of the financial liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2002 was: 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities Currency m m m m m m Sterling 171 59 112 12 12 US dollar 971 194 777 1,050 318 732 Australian dollar 487 110 377 474 104 370 Czech koruna 51 34 17 65 12 53 Others 17 1 16 18 18 Total 1,697 398 1,299 1,619 446 1,173 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the denition of financial liabilities.
There are no material financial liabilities on which interest is not paid.
The effect of the Group interest swaps was to classify 377 million of oating rate Australian dollar borrowings as xed rate, 510 million of oating rate US dollar borrowings as xed rate, 112 million of oating rate sterling borrowings as xed rate and 16 million of variable rate Czech koruna borrowings as xed rate, in the above table.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions are considered to be oating rate financial liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash ows have been discounted.
The oating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest rates xed in advance for various time periods up to 12 months by reference to LIBOR for that time period.
The gures in the following tables take into account interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest rate and currency prole of financial liabilities and financial assets.

All investments are in publicly quoted stocks or treasury instruments.
Letters of credit totalling 145 million are supported on a cash collateral basis at 31 December 2002. d Currency exposures As explained on page 18 of the Operating and financial review, the Groups objective in managing the currency exposures arising during the normal course of business in other words, its structural currency exposures is to fully hedge all known contractual currency exposures, where possible.
As at 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2001, these exposures were not considered to be material.
Currency exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
For major currencies, it is not our policy to hedge currency translation through forward contracts or currency swaps.
During 2002 we closed out all Czech koruna forward contracts and currency swaps, as we now consider the Czech koruna to be a major currency.
e Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors and accruals, was as follows: 31 December 31 December 2002 2001 m m In one year or less, or on demand 1,078 127 In more than one year but not more than two years 39 390 In more than two years but not more than five years 128 749 In more than five years 452 353 Total 1,697 1,619 As discussed in note 17, the Group is in discussions with bank groups in relation to non-recourse debt for Rugeley and the US merchant asset portfolio.
We believe we have constructive and acceptable plans to resolve all issues to the mutual benefit of both International Power and the banks such that a substantial portion of the 1,078 million disclosed above will be redesignated as due in more than five years.
76 INTERNATIONAL POWER Notes to the accounts continued 26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued f Borrowing facilities The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December 2002 in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at that date amount to 1,342 million.

The drawn element of the US$570 million Corporate revolving credit facility relates to letters of credit issued.
As disclosed in note 17, the Group is in discussions with bank groups in relation to non-recourse debt for ANP Funding 1 and Rugeley.
The undrawn portion of these facilities has therefore been shown as unavailable in the above table, and will become substantially available when these issues have been formally resolved and documented.
These facilities include a 25 million letter of credit facility which becomes committed for any letters of credit that have been drawn.
At 31 December 2002, 24 million of letters of credit had been drawn from this facility.
Uncommitted facilities available at 31 December 2002 were: 31 December 2002 31 December 2001 Total Drawn Undrawn Total Drawn Undrawn Facility m m m m m m Bank borrowings and overdraft facilities 37 37 44 44 Thai National Power working capital facility 1 1 Pelican Point working capital facility 3 3 3 3 41 41 47 47 Bank borrowing facilities are normally reafrmed by the banks annually although they can theoretically be withdrawn at any time.
g Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2002.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial instruments are as follows: i For investments of up to three months trade debtors, other debtors and prepayments, trade creditors, other current liabilities, long-term and short-term borrowings, the book value approximates to fair value because of their short maturity.
ii The fair value of investments maturing after three months has been estimated using quoted market prices.
iii The fair value of long-term borrowings and interest rate swaps has been calculated using market prices when available or the net present value of future cash ows arising.
iv The fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options has been calculated using the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.
v The fair value of energy derivatives is measured using value at risk and other methodologies that provide a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy products.
Within the above fair values, only the financial assets and liabilities have been marked-to-market as dened by the requirements of the accounting standard.
h Hedges As explained on page 18 of the Operating and financial review, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: i Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, options and forward rate agreements.
ii Structural and transactional currency exposures using currency borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts, currency options and swaps.
iii Currency exposures on future expected sales using currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts, currency options and swaps.
iv Energy price uctuations using physical hedges through the operation of energy supply and trading activities together with financial products.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Debt Foreign Energy Total net exchange derivatives gain loss m m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 January 2002 17 4 6 15 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 4 5 1 ended 31 December 2002 Gains and losses arising in the year ended 31 December 2002 that were not 54 1 29 26 recognised in the year Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2002 71 1 30 42 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in the year 1 24 23 ended 31 December 2003 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in the year ended 31 December 2004 or later 71 6 65 The hedging of structural currency exposures associated with foreign currency net investments are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.

28 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES a Legal proceedings against the Company The Company is aware of the following matters, which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group: i Claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the Central Electricity Generating Board CEGB, and contractors in respect of industrial illness and injury.
Innogy has agreed to indemnify us on an after-tax basis to the extent of 50% of any liability that we may incur whether directly or indirectly as a consequence of those proceedings to the extent such liability is not insured by Electra Insurance Limited.
ii In 1994 separate complaints were made by the National Association of Licensed Opencast Operators NALOO and the South Wales Small Miners Association SWSMA to the European Commission against the Company, PowerGen plc, British Coal Corporation and HM Government.
The complaint alleges violations of EU Competition law arising out of the coal purchasing arrangements entered into by the CEGB prior to 1 April 1990 and requests the Commission to nd that the CEGBs practices violated EU law.
NALOO and SWSMA allege that such a nding would be grounds for a claim for damages in the English courts by members of NALOO.
An appeal against the Commissions findings was brought by a faction of SWSMA, which was initially ruled out of time, but an appeal was reinstated.
Progress with this claim will be inuenced by the outcome of the NALOO appeal.
The European Court has ruled that the Commission is under an obligation to investigate the complaint by NALOO.
The Company, PowerGen plc, British Coal Corporation and the Commission have appealed against the ruling.
Judgement is expected sometime after May 2003.
It is not practicable to estimate legal costs or possible damages at this stage.
The Commission ruled on the complaint in 1998 and did not make any findings against the Company.
Innogy has agreed to indemnify us on an after-tax basis to the extent of 50% of any liability that we may incur whether directly or indirectly as a consequence of those proceedings.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, the Groups insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that the matters referred to above will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Groups financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
b Taxation The Company is aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of disputes with the tax authorities in the territories where the Group has operations.
The principal exposures where significant amounts of tax could potentially arise are in respect of the following matters: i There are potential exposures relating to the UK tax losses generated from the acquisition of Australian subsidiaries and related nancing arrangements.
Discussions are continuing with the UK Inland Revenue to reach agreement on these issues.
ii The UK Inland Revenue have queried the calculation of capital gains arising from the sale of UK power stations by National Power PLC in the period before demerger in October 2000.
Discussions are continuing with the UK Inland Revenue to determine the amount that is deductible from the consideration received.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to the professional advice received, that adequate provision has been made for the settlement of any taxation liabilities that might arise.
c Bonds and guarantees Various growth and expansion projects are supported by bonds, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Company totalling 286 million.
10 million of this is in respect of the loan facilities of its Elcogas investment.
