Authority will be sought to purchase up to 14.99% of the Companys Ordinary shares in issue at the date of the passing of the resolution the maximum permitted under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority at a price that is not less than 25p per share the nominal value of each share and must not exceed the higher of a 5% above the average closing price as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the day of purchase and b the higher of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock Exchange.
The full text of the authority being sought can be found in Resolution 11 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
The decision as to whether the Company repurchases any shares will be at the absolute discretion of the Board and will only be considered when it is in the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
It is the intention that purchases will only be made at a discount to net asset value.
Articles of Association Resolution 12 proposes that two principal changes be made to the Articles of Association.
Firstly, it is proposed that the maximum aggregate amount of fees that may be paid to the Directors, without having to obtain additional shareholder approval, be increased from 100,000 to 125,000 per annum Article 95.
Secondly, in order to reflect technological changes, it is proposed to amend the Articles of Association Article 11.1 to permit certificates for shares and debentures to be issued with a securities seal attached or printed by any mechanical, electronic, laser or other means approved by the directors.
In addition, it is proposed that certain definitions in Article 2 be updated.
A copy of the new Articles marked to show the changes being made is available for inspection at the registered address of the Company and at the offices of Macfarlanes LLP, 20 Cursitor Street, London, EC4A 1LT during normal business hours on any day Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted from the date of the notice of the AGM until the conclusion of the AGM.

Payment of suppliers It is the Companys payment policy to obtain the best possible terms for all business.
The Company negotiates with its suppliers the terms on which business will take place and abides by such terms.
The Company did not have any trade creditors at 31 December 2011 or 2012.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor The Directors confirm that so far as each of the Directors is aware there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditor is unaware and the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditor is aware of that information.
Independent Auditors The Auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, are willing to continue in office and in accordance with sections 489 and 491 1 of the Companies Act 2006 resolutions concerning their reappointment and remuneration will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board Julian Cazalet Chairman 27 February 2013 30 DIReCtoRs ReMUneRAtIon RePoRt The Board has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 34 and 35.
Remuneration Committee The Company has four Directors all of whom are non-executive see page 4.
There is no separate Remuneration Committee and the Board as a whole considers changes to Directors fees from time to time.
The Company Secretary, Baillie Gifford & Co, provides advice and comparative information when the Board considers the level of Directors fees.
Policy on Directors Fees The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Directors should be set at a reasonable level that is commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the role and consistent with the requirement to attract and retain Directors of the appropriate quality and experience.
It should also reflect the experience of the Board as a whole and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts that are similar in size.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ending 31 December 2013 and subsequent years.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within an aggregate limit set out in the Companys Articles of Association which currently stands at 100,000 per annum.
Shareholders approval to increase the limit pursuant to Article 95 of the Articles of Association to 125,000 per annum in aggregate will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The Board reviewed Directors fees during the year and concluded that the fees should be increased from 25,500 to 28,500 for the Chairman and from 17,000 to 19,000 for each Director with the Chairman of the Audit Committee receiving an additional 2,000 per annum.
This increase was effective from 1 July 2012.
Directors fees were previously increased in 2009.
Directors service Contracts It is the Boards policy that none of the Directors has a service contract.
All of the Directors have been provided with appointment letters.
The terms of their appointment provide that a Director shall retire and be subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment.
Under the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors are required to retire at each Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-election.
There is no notice period and no provision for compensation upon early termination of appointment.
