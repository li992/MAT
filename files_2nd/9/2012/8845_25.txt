Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements 99 Notes to the Company financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 Accounting policies continued Share-based charges The Company has a number of share schemes as detailed in the Group accounting policies and note 20 to the Group financial statements.
Details relating to the calculation of share-based charges are provided in note 20 to the Group financial statements.
In respect of the Company, the charge is shown as an increase in the Companys investments, as the employees to which the charge relates are employed by subsidiary companies.
Taxation The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profits differ from the profit reported in the profit and loss account due to timing differences and other items that require adjustment as set out in legislation.
The Companys liability for tax is calculated using rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
The deferred tax position is calculated using the rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax losses are surrendered or claimed in the form of group relief with consideration being received or paid accordingly.
The group relief amount is recorded separately within the debtors and creditors amounts in the balance sheet, as applicable, and is calculated by applying the tax rate enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date to the loss amount.
Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Dividend income is credited to the profit and loss account when the dividend has been approved by the Board of directors of the subsidiary company making the payment.
