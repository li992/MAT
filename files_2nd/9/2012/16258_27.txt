The UK schemes are closed to new members, hence under the projected unit credit method, the current service cost expressed as a percentage of the salaries of the remaining members will increase as the remaining active members of the scheme approach retirement.
In 2012, the Group agreed to make special contributions to the UK pension schemes of 3.5m per annum until January 2013.
This contribution schedule remains in place until the 2014 funding valuations are finalised expected in the first half of 2015.
In March 2012, the Group agreed to replace previous letters of credit supporting scheme mergers with a guarantee for ten years issued by UBM plc to the trustees of the UGPS.
Similarly, in June 2012, the Group agreed to put in place a guarantee for ten years issued by UBM plc and Wenport Limited to the trustees of the UMFSS.
Under these guarantees, an amount up to the value of 35% of the aggregate liability of participating employers on the basis set out in Section 318 of the Pensions Act 2004 could be demanded by the Trustee in certain circumstances.
The main conditions under which the guarantees could be called upon relate to events which would imperil the interests of the scheme, such as insolvency, or the Group failing to make agreed payments.
