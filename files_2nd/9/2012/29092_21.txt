In particular, it should have sufficient capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Generally, surplus capital is loaned back to the Groups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in Risk management and internal controls within the Governance section of this document as well as in note 20.
The Companys specic risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash ow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover its normal course of business.
The Company can request to borrow through intragroup loans and the Group loan facility see below to maintain sufficient liquidity.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 250 million, which was undrawn by the Company at the year end date 2011: undrawn.
The facility expires on 23 September 2013.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash ows of financial instruments will uctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2012, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher nil lower 2011: 50 basis points higher nil lower with all other variables held constant, the Company estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased decreased by 3 million nil 2011: increased decreased by 3 million nil respectively, mainly as a result of higher net interest income on the Companys interestbearing intercompany receivables and payables and cash: other components of equity would have been unaffected.
The model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits assumes that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Foreign exchange and pricing risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of financial instruments will uctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ows of financial instruments will uctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Company is not directly exposed to foreign exchange or pricing risk.
The Companys investment in its directly held subsidiary is in Sterling and is held at historic cost.
It has indirect exposure to foreign exchange and pricing risk in the Group which could result in the impairment of this subsidiary.
There are currently sufficient resources in subsidiaries to absorb any normal market events.
