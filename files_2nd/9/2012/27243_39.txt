Directors Responsibility for the Financial Statements The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with the requirements of Guernsey law.
The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as of 31 December 2012, and of its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of The Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.

The other information comprises only the Company Overview, the Directors, Managers and Advisers, the Chairmans Statement, the Investment Managers Report, the Board of Directors, the Directors Report and Responsibility Statement and the Directors Remuneration Report.
In our opinion, the information given in the Directors Report and Responsibilities Statement is consistent with the financial statements.
