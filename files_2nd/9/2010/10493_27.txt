The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
This is discussed in the business review under the heading Going concern.
Mondi plc has made use of the exemption from preparing a profit and loss account, as conferred by Section 408 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
Mondi plc is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, from disclosing related party balances, and under the terms of FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, from disclosing financial instruments and risk management disclosures.

Gains and losses arising on foreign currency transactions and balances are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Tax Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the reporting date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on a timing difference arising from the undistributed earnings of Mondi plcs direct and indirect subsidiaries, where there is no commitment to distribute these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Distributions Dividend distributions to the shareholders of Mondi plc are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the board.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim dividends are accounted for when paid.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provision for any diminution in value.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

qxp 3 1 11 8:26 AM Page 149 1 Accounting policies continued Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the borrowing period using the effective interest rate method.
Share-based payments Mondi plc operates a number of share-based payment plans for its own staff and staff employed by other Group undertakings.
The fair value of an equity instrument granted under such a plan is recorded in the share-based payments reserve incrementally over the  vesting period and either recognised as a capital contribution to the employing subsidiaries, where applicable, or within the income statement.
At each reporting date, estimates regarding the future probability of service, and non-market performance conditions being met are revised on a basis consistent with recent experience.
Any resultant revisions of original estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of investments in employing subsidiaries or in the income statement, as appropriate, and the share-based payments reserve.
Employing subsidiaries reimburse Mondi plc for the cost of equity instruments granted.
Reimbursement receipts represent a return of capital contributed and are treated as a reduction in the cost of investments in employing subsidiaries.
Treasury shares The purchase by Mondi plc of its own equity instruments, either directly or via an Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust over which Mondi plc has fide facto control, results in the recognition of treasury shares.
The consideration paid is deducted from shareholders funds and is separately disclosed.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold, reissued, or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to the equity holders of Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects.
Pensions The cost of defined contribution pension plans is charged as an expense as the costs become payable.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
