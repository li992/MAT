69 Overview Strategy & operations Performance & financials Introduction and table of contents Responsibility Governance Financial statements In preparing these financial statements we have changed the format and layout following the principles outlined in the Financial Reporting Councils publication Louder than words.
We have made these changes to make ITVs financial statements less complex and more relevant to shareholders.
We have grouped notes under three key headings: Results for the year, Operating assets and liabilities and Capital structure and financing costs.
Each section sets out the accounting policies applied in producing these notes together with any key judgements and estimates used.
The purpose of these changes is to provide readers with a clearer understanding of what drives financial performance of the Group.
Text in speech bubbles provides commentary on each section in plain English.
Notes to the financial statements provide additional information required by statute, accounting standards or Listing Rules to explain a particular feature of the financial statements.
The notes which follow will also provide explanations and additional disclosure to assist readers understanding and interpretation of the annual report and the financial statements.
