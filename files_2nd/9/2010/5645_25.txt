In 2009, restructuring provisions were held against onerous property costs and future redundancy costs.
During 2010 the onerous property costs provision was transferred to other provisions.
Other provisions relate primarily to vacant properties and employees compensation claims.
Non-current provisions are generally long-term in nature with the timing of utilisation uncertain.
Employee benefits Post-retirement benefits Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes as at 5 April 2009 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
The UK government announced on the 8 July 2010 that it will in future use the Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Price Index for the purpose of determining statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes.
The Groups current UK defined benefit pension scheme rules specify that pensions in deferment will increase in line with the annual statutory order published by the UK government.
The Group has therefore amended its assumptions for increases to pensions in deferment to reflect this.
The resulting reduction in the present value of the schemes liabilities of 4.0m is included as a change in assumptions within other comprehensive income.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Defined benefit contributions in 2011 are expected to be 9.5m, which consists of payments to fund future service accruals and contributions to amortise the deficit in respect of past service.
