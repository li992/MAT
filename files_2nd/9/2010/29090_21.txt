In particular, it should have sufficient capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Any surplus capital is loaned back to the Groups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in Risk management and Internal controls within the Governance section of the Annual Report and Accounts and in note 27.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy isto maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain the solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover their normal course of business.
Outside the normal course of business the Company can request to borrow investment capital through intergroup loans and the Group loan facility see below to maintain sufficient liquidity.
The Group has investment capital which includes investments in fixed income and money market portfolios.
Liquidity in these portfolios is monitored by the Group onaregular basis.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 250 million, of which 10 million was drawn by the Company in October 2010 and remained drawn at the balance sheet date.
The amount borrowed was repaid in January 2011.
The facility expires on 27 September 2013.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2010, if interest rates had been 200 basis points higher nil lower 2009: 250 basis points higher nil lower with all other variables held constant, the Company estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased decreased by 4 million nil 2009: increased decreased by 3 million nil respectively, mainly as a result of higher lower interest income on the Companys interest bearing intercompany receivables and payables, bank borrowings and cash: other components of equity would have been unaffected.
The following assumption was made in the model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits: The fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate bacause of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Companys exposure to foreign exchange risk has been hedged using currency forwards as detailed in note 53.
Pricing risk Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
TheCompany has minimal exposure in this area.
53 Derivative contracts 2010 2009 Notional Notional amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities m m m m m m 1.9 Forward foreign exchange contract maturing in less than one year 1.9 The notional amounts disclosed in 2009 being the principle amount on which the derivative is based of certain types of financial instruments provide a basis for comparison with instruments previously recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Companys exposure to credit or pricerisks.
The Company did not hold any currency forwards as at 31 December 2010.
