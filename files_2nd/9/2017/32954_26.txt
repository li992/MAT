GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISCLOSURE The current activities of the Group and those factors likely to affect its future development, together with a description of its financial position, are described in the Strategic Report.
Principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, and the steps taken to mitigate these risks are described on pages 54 to 57.
Critical accounting estimates affecting the carrying values of assets and liabilities of the Group are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements.
During 2017, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those factors that would threaten its future performance, solvency or liquidity.
This ongoing assessment forms part of the Groups three-year strategic plan.
After making appropriate enquiries and having regard to the Groups cash balances and normal business planning and control procedures, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
As part of this assessment, the Directors prepared a three-year forecast considering the going concern status for the period to December 2018 in accordance with the Companys Three-Year Plan, which is considered to be an appropriate period over which the Group can predict its revenue, cost base and cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, as opposed to more arbitrary forms of forecasts based solely on percentage increases.
Notwithstanding, due to the significant cash reserves and projected profitability over the next 12 months, the Directors have no reason to believe that the Groups viability will be threatened over a period longer than that covered by the positive confirmation of long-term viability above.
Given the above, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDINGS As of 13 February 2018, the Company had been advised of the following significant shareholders each holding more than 3% of the Companys issued share capital, based on 317,344,603 ordinary shares in issue: No.
