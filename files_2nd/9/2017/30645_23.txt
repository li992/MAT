109 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The scope of our audit As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the Financial Statements.
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industry in which it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the Group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
We designed audit procedures at group and significant component level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
We focused on laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group Financial Statements, including but not limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules, the UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant component teams.
Our tests included, but were not limited to, review of the financial statement disclosures and underlying supporting documentation, review of the litigation register, enquiries of management, review of significant components auditors work, involving our tax specialists in the audit and review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the Financial Statements.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the Financial Statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud.
As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Valuation of investment properties Assessing the Valuers expertise and objectivity Refer to page 79 Audit Committee Report and Financial We assessed the Valuers qualifications and expertise and read their terms of engagement with the Group Statements including notes to the Financial Statements: to determine whether there were any matters that might have affected their objectivity or may have Note1, Significant accounting policies: Note 13, Properties: imposed scope limitations upon their work.

How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial Statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Groups reportable segments are the geographical Business Units: Greater London, Thames Valley and National Logistics, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Central Europe.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial Statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.
The Group operates a common IT environment, processes and controls for rental income and payroll across all its reported segments.
The Groups valuation and treasury functions are also based at the corporate centre in the UK.
The related balances were therefore audited by the Group audit team from the UK, using Computer Assisted Audit Techniques for the work on rental income.
Additional specified procedures were performed by audit teams on location in each business unit, such that the total testing programme provided sufficient audit evidence over all financial statement line items.
The SELP Joint Venture was included as being in scope for a full scope audit, with the work on rental income and valuation for the joint venture performed by the Group audit team.
Throughout the audit process, the Group audit team has had various interactions with the audit teams on location in each business unit to oversee the audit process.
Taking into account the components and Joint Ventures subject to a full scope audit, the centralised and other testing performed, coverage over the Group Balance Sheet and Group Income Statement was as follows: Assets 99% coverage Liabilities 96% coverage Income 98% coverage Expenditure 92% coverage The audit of the Company Financial Statements was performed entirely by the Group audit team in the UK, leveraging on the work performed on the Group audit where appropriate with additional audit procedures performed on other Company specific balances.
111 OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the Financial Statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Financial Statements as a whole as follows: Group Financial Statements Company Financial Statements Overall materiality 79.4 million 2016: 61.0 million.
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied The primary measurement attribute of the Group The primary measurement attribute of the Company is the carrying value of property investments.
is the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries.
On this basis, we set an overall Group materiality On this basis, we set an overall Company materiality level based on total assets.
level based on total assets.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.
The range of materiality allocated across components was between 30.0 million and 71.4 million.
In addition, we set a specific overall materiality level of 9.7 million, equating to 5% of adjusted profit before tax, for items impacting adjusted profit before tax.
In arriving at this judgement we had regard to the fact that the adjusted profit before tax is a secondary financial indicator of the Group refer to note 2 of the Financial Statements on page 125 where the term is defined in full.. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 4.0 million Group audit 2016: 1.0 million or 1.0 million in the case of misstatements impacting adjusted profit before tax, and 3.4 million Company audit 2016: 1.0 million as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the Financial Statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors Report and Corporate Governance Statement, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

We have nothing to report arising from our responsibility to report if a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the Company.
The directors assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding: The directors confirmation on page 106 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
The directors explanation on page 57 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group.
