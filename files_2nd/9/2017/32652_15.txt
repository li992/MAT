Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information The scope of an audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups and the Parent Companys circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing the audit, and in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
ISA 320 We determined Group materiality to be 40m 2016: 40m, which is approximately 5% 2016: 5% of profit before tax.
The basis for Group materiality is normally underlying profit before tax, but in the current period this is equivalent to profit before tax as there are no exceptional items.
The rationale for using underlying profit before tax as our basis for materiality is that it provides a consistent period on period approach, excluding one off gains or losses which can be significant compared to underlying trading performance.
Performance materiality Tolerance for potential The application of materiality at the individual account or balance uncorrected level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level misstatements 25% 10m the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
ISA 320 On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that Performance performance Group materiality should be set at 75% 2016: 75% of materiality 30m Tolerance for potential Group materiality, the top end of our range, namely 30m 2016: 30m : Materiality 40m undetected although we reduce our testing threshold in areas of significant risk to misstatements 75% appropriately reflect our assessment of risk of material misstatement and focus on the key judgements and estimates.
The audits of the full and specific scope entities are performed at a performance materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group performance materiality of 30m 2016: 30m appropriate to the relative scale and risk of the business concerned.
NEXT Retail Limited was allocated 24m 2016: 24m equating to 80% of the Group performance materiality.
In the current period the range of performance materiality allocated to the other components was 6m 2016: 6m to 9m 2016: 9m equating to 20% to 30% of Group performance materiality.
Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
ISA 450 We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 2m 2016: 2m, which is set at 5% of Group materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of Group materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
n e x t p l c. c o. u k 87 slugline Independent Auditors Report to the Members of NEXT plc Scope of our audit for the 52 week period ended 28 January 2017 Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of Group materiality and our allocation of Group performance materiality determine the audit scope for each component within the Group.
Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the financial statements.
We take account of size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.
After assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, we ensured we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements.
Of the 25 2016: 25 reporting components of the Group, we selected 6 2016: 6 components covering 5 2016: 5 entities within the UK and one 2016: one in Hong Kong, which represent the principal business units within the Group.

Full scope components selected being NEXT plc, NEXT Holdings Limited formerly named NEXT Group plc and NEXT Retail Limited were selected based on their size and risk characteristics.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of these full scope components.
NEXT Retail Limited which includes the Retail and Directory Businesses accounts for more than 92% 2016: 90% of underlying profit before tax, 96% 2016: 97% of external revenue and 76% 2016: 78% of total assets.
Specific scope components comprise NEXT Distribution Limited, Lipsy Limited and NEXT Sourcing Limited.
We performed audit procedures on specific accounts within these components that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the Group financial statements, either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
These entities are subject to overall analytical review procedures to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Although not relied upon for the purpose of this opinion, the majority of the remaining components have to prepare statutory accounts which are audited by EY member firms.
For the elimination adjustments posted in the Group consolidation, we performed procedures to confirm there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements including the testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations.
Involvement with component teams In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we the Primary team determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Primary audit team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction.
All full and specific scope component audit procedures were performed directly by the Primary audit team other than for NEXT Sourcing Limited where the work was performed by EY Hong Kong.
We determined the appropriate level of involvement in the audit of each component to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current periods audit cycle, meetings with EY Hong Kong were chaired by senior members of the Primary audit team and a face to face meeting was held with NEXT Sourcing management.
The meetings included our attendance at the team planning meeting and closing meeting with local management.
We discussed their risk assessment, audit approach and results of the audit.
The Primary audit team also interacted regularly with the component audit team throughout the course of the audit, and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
