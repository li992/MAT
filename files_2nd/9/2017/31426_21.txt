UBM Annual Report and Accounts 2017 82 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Scheme interests The table below shows details of outstanding awards held by Executive Directors, including awards granted in 2017 under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
PSP awards were subject to the achievement of performance conditions which were set at grant.
DBP awards are based on the prior achievement of annual performance conditions and vest subject to continued employment only.
Share price at exercise was 702.02p.
Executives undertaking external appointments The Company considers that permitting Executive Directors to hold office as a Non-Executive Director of another Company will benefit UBM by increasing their knowledge and experience.
In normal circumstances, Executive Directors are permitted to accept one outside corporate directorship, subject to Board approval.
In exceptional circumstances two directorships may be allowed.
Directors are entitled to retain the fees earned.
Tim Cobbold is an independent Non-Executive Director of Drax Group plc and received fees of 55,000 during 2017.
Marina Wyatt is a Non-Executive Director of Renewi plc previously called Shanks Group plc in the UK, receiving fees of 54,105 during 2017 and a member of the Supervisory Board of Lucas Bols NV in The Netherlands receiving fees of 30,000 during 2017.
Both roles were held by Marina at the time of her recruitment, and the Board therefore considered it was appropriate that she continued in these roles.
The Board keeps this position under review but given the relative size of the companies and time commitment required, it remains comfortable that this does not impact on Marinas ability to properly carry out her UBM role.

Change in remuneration of the CEO compared to UBM employees The table below sets out the increase in total remuneration of the CEO and that of the comparator group selected by the Committee.
The employee comparison consists of all UK-based employees.

This is to support the Companys drive to improve overall organic revenue at all level of events.
The Committee believe this measure is well balanced with the other measures in the bonus plan which focus management on continued profitability and margin efficiency as well as driving our strategic goals through personal objectives set.
For PSP awards, the Committee introduced Total Group Revenue alongside TSR, EPS growth and ROACE for awards granted in 2017 onwards.
The Committee believes this combination of measures continues to support the delivery of Events First and the creation of shareholder value.
UBM has established strong governance and controls around our acquisition strategy, including required returns criteria.
This is reported to the Board and, for acquisitions of a certain size, the Board reviews each proposal before determining whether to proceed or not.
Furthermore, in order to safeguard against unprofitable organic revenue growth, a consistent approach has been introduced to assess and approve new event launches across the Group.
The Committee is confident that it has the governance and controls in place to ensure incentivising revenue growth drives the right management behaviours for the benefit of shareholders, and it will continue to apply its judgement and discretion as appropriate.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors fees are paid partly in cash and partly in UBM shares.
Cash fees are paid monthly in arrears.
The sharebased element is satisfied by the delivery of shares six-monthly in arrears.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director receive additional fees.
