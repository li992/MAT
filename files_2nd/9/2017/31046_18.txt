Overview of our audit approach Overall materiality: 7,608,000, which represents approximately one per cent of the Company's net assets: Key audit matters were identified as valuation and existence of investments: and Our audit approach was a risk-based substantive audit focused on the investment activities of the Company.
Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 67 Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified.
These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in the audit Valuation and existence of investments The Companys business is to achieve long-term capital growth Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: through investing in a portfolio of companies, both quoted and obtaining confirmation of all investments held at the year end unquoted.
As a result, the Company has significant exposure to directly from the independent custodian: quoted and unquoted investments which represent nearly 100 per confirming year-end holdings for a sample of unquoted cent of the Companys total assets.
Additionally, valuation of investments directly with investee companies: unquoted investments is subjective and include a number of assessing the appropriateness of the Companys accounting judgements.
policy in accordance with FRS 102 and its consistent application year on year: We therefore identified the existence and valuation of quoted and agreeing the valuation of quoted investment to an independent unquoted investments as a significant risk, which was one of the source of market prices: most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
conducting procedures to satisfy ourselves of the qualifications and expertise of the investment manager to prepare valuations of unquoted investments for the Company: and using our own valuation experts to inform our challenge of the AIFM on the valuation methodology used for a sample of unquoted investments and whether this was in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines and FRS 102.
Specifically, we focused on the appropriateness of the valuation basis selected, the underlying assumptions used and key financial inputs.
The Company's accounting policy on the investments is shown in note 2 b to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in note 9.
The Audit Committee identified valuation of the investment portfolio, including the unquoted holdings, as a significant issue in its report on page 60 where the Audit Committee also described the action that it has taken to address this issue.
Key observations Our audit work did not identify any material misstatements concerning the valuation and existence of investments.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced.
We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our work and in evaluating the results of that work.
We determined materiality for the audit of the financial statements as a whole to be 7,608,000, which is approximately one per cent of the Companys net assets.
This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because it represents a key financial metric used to measure the performance of the Company and is of primary interest to the users of the financial statements.
Materiality for the current year is lower than the level that we determined for the year ended 31 December 2016, reflecting a slight decrease in the value of net assets in the year.
68 Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc We use a different level of materiality, performance materiality, to drive the extent of our testing and this was set at 75 per cent of financial statement materiality.
We also determine a lower level of specific materiality for certain areas such as investment income and Directors remuneration.
We determined the threshold at which we will communicate misstatements to the Audit Committee to be 380,400.
In addition, we will communicate misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the Company's business, its environment and risk profile.
As part of the engagement, we attended periodic Audit Committee meetings in order to document our understanding of the valuation and control review process, including corporate governance.
In addition, we undertook numerous walkthroughs of the systems and controls in order to assess the effectiveness of the internal controls.
Specifically, we documented and assessed the design and implementation of the investment valuation process and the controls in place at the AIFM.
We also performed substantive audit procedures on specific transactions, including individually material balances and disclosures, the extent of which was based on various factors such as our overall assessment of the control environment and our evaluation of the design and implementation of controls that address significant audit risks.

Woodford Patient Capital Trust plc 69 Matters on which we are required to report by exception We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns: or certain disclosures of Directors remuneration specified by law are not made: or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of Directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the statement of Directors responsibilities set out on page 66, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
We are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance that the financial statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements of the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the ISAs UK.
Our audit approach is a risk-based approach and is explained more fully in the An overview of the scope of our audit section of our audit report.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at: www.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Other matters we are required to address We were appointed by the Board on 24 February 2015.
The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is three years.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the Company and we remain independent of the Company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.
