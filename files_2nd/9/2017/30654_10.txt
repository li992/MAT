39 Greencoat UK Wind PLC Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 Independent Auditors Report continued Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signicance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identied.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The valuation of investments in the underlying wind farm portfolio was the risk that had the greatest impact on our audit strategy and scope, including the allocation of resources in the audit.
Risk Description How Our Audit Addressed the Risk The valuation of In respect of the equity investments valued using discounted cash ow models, we investments is a highly performed the following specic procedures: subjective accounting Used spreadsheet analysis tools to assess the integrity of the valuation models and estimate where there is track changes to inputs or structure an inherent risk of management override Agreed wind generation and power price forecasts to independent reports arising from the For new investments we obtained and reviewed all key agreements and contracts investment valuations and considered whether these were accurately reected in the valuation model being prepared by the For existing investments we analysed changes in significant assumptions compared Investment Manager, with assumptions audited in previous periods and vouched these to independent who is remunerated evidence including available industry data based on the net asset value of the Company.
Challenged the appropriateness of the selection and application of key assumptions in the model including the discount factor, ination, asset life, energy yield and 100% of the underlying power price applied by benchmarking to available industry data and consulting investment portfolio is with our internal valuations specialists represented by unquoted equity and Reviewed the corporation tax workings within the valuation model loan investments and all Agreed cash and other net assets to bank statements and investee company investments are management accounts individually material to the financial statements.
Considered the accuracy of forecasting by comparing previous forecasts to actual results Reviewed the outcome of purchase price true-ups that have taken place in the year and confirmed that these have been accurately reected in the models.
For loan investments we performed the following: Vouched to loan agreements and veried the terms of the loan Considered wider economic and commercial factors that, in our opinion could impact on the recoverability and fair value of the loan Considered the carrying value of the loan with regard to the unit of account concept.
For each of the key assumptions in the valuation models, we considered the appropriateness of the assumption and whether alternative reasonable assumptions could have been applied.
We considered each assumption in isolation as well as in conjunction with other assumptions and the valuation as a whole.
Where appropriate, we sensitised the valuations where other reasonable alternative assumptions could have been applied.
We also considered the completeness and clarity of disclosures regarding the range of reasonable alternative assumptions in the financial statements.
Based on our procedures performed we concluded that the valuation of the investment portfolio was considered to be within an acceptable range.
40 GREENCOAT U K W I N D Independent Auditors Report continued Our Application of Materiality We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements.
For planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could inuence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Importantly, misstatements below this level will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identied misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
The application of these key considerations gives rise to 2 levels of materiality for the Group, the quantum and purpose of which are tabulated below.
Materiality Measure Purpose Basic and Key Considerations Quantum Financial Assessing whether the financial Based on 1.5% of net asset value 17,100,000 statement statements as a whole present The nature of the investment portfolio materiality a true and fair view and the level of judgement inherent in the valuation The level of gearing in the portfolio Specic Assessing those classes of 10% of profit before tax for the year 4,500,000 materiality transactions, balances or excluding unrealised valuation classes of disclosures for which movements transactions misstatements of lesser amounts and balances than materiality for the financial which impact statements as a whole could on the realised reasonably be expected to return inuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
It is appropriate to set financial statement materiality for the parent company and the other component at a lower level than Group materiality.
In light of the nature of the transactions and balances within each company, we have set materiality at 95% of Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Audit Committee all audit differences in excess of 242,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An Overview of the Scope of Our Audit A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the FRCs website at www.
uk auditscopeukprivate Our audit approach was developed by obtaining an understanding of the Groups activities, the key functions undertaken on behalf of the Board by the Investment Manager and Administrator and the overall control environment.
Based on this understanding we assessed those aspects of the Groups financial statements which were most likely to give rise to a material misstatement.
The Group audit engagement team was responsible for the audit of all entities included in the consolidated financial statements.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.

Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Companys members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at: www.
This description forms part of our Auditors report.

The non-audit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting our audit.
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.
