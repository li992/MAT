Overview of our audit approach Key audit matters Revenue recognition Inventory valuation and profit recognition Valuation of shared equity receivables Audit scope We performed an audit of Persimmon plc, as a single aggregated set of financial information.
Our work therefore covered 100% of Profit before tax, 100% of Revenue and 100% of Total assets.
This is consistent with our approach to the prior year audit.
Materiality Overall group materiality of 48.3m which represents 5% of Profit before tax.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud that we identified.
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit ofthe financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

An overview of the scope of our audit Tailoring the scope We performed an audit of Persimmon plc, as a single aggregated set of financial information.
Our work therefore covered 100% ofProfit before tax, 100% of Revenue and 100% of Total assets.
Our application of materiality We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence theeconomic decisions of the users of the financial statements.
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent ofour audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 48.3 million 2016: 38.7 million, which is 5% 2016: 5% of Profit before tax.
We believe that Profit before tax provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality and is the most relevant measure for stakeholders as it is a focus of both management and investors.
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be 18.7 million 2016: 13.9 million, which is 1% 2016: 1% of Equity.
Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level.
It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low levelthe probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Groups overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% 2016: 50% of our planning materiality, namely 36.2m 2016: 19.4m.
We have set performance materiality at this percentage based on our assessment of the control environment of the group and expectation oferrors.
50% was used in the prior year as this was an initial audit.
indd 84 07 03 2018 11:47 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 85 Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 2.4m 2016: 1.9m, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 80, other than the financial statements and our auditors report thereon.
The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated inthis report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our responsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions: Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 57 the statement by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the groups performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit: or Audit committee reporting set out on pages 54 to 58 the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee: or Directors statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code set out on page 59 the parts of the directors statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the companys compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.

indd 85 07 03 2018 11:47 86 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PERSIMMON PLC ONLY continued Matters on which we are required to report by exception In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course ofthe audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to youif, in our opinion: adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us: or the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns: or certain disclosures of directors remuneration specified by law are not made: or we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors responsibilities statement set out on page 80, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are: to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud: to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses: and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit.
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.
Our approach was as follows: we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant frameworks which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those than relate to the reporting framework IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the UK: we understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, Internal Audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary.
We corroborated our enquiries through our review ofboard minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee: and we assessed the susceptibility of the groups financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was a susceptibility to fraud.
We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings.
We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud: and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls.
Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.
These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud and error.
indd 86 07 03 2018 11:47 Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information 87 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified in the paragraphs above.
Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, andjournals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business: enquiries of Legal Counsel, Group management, Internal Audit, subsidiary Management at all full and specific scope components: and focused testing, as referred to in the key audit matters section above.
In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, UK legislation and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Councils website at https: www.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Other matters we are required to address We were appointed by the company on 14 April 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2016 andsubsequent financial periods: the period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 2 years, covering the years ending 31 December 2016 to 31 December 2017: the non-audit services prohibited by the FRCs Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit: and the audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.
