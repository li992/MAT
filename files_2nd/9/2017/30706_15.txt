We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work.
Materiality was determined as follows: Materiality measure Group Parent 19.8m which is 1% of the Groups net 19.7m which is 1% of the Companys Financial statements as a whole assets.
This benchmark is considered net assets.
This benchmark is the most appropriate because net considered the most appropriate assets, which primarily comprise because net assets, which primarily the Groups investment portfolio, are comprise the Companys investment considered to be the key driver of the portfolio, are considered to be the key Groups total return performance driver of the Companys total return and form a part of the net asset value performance and form a part of the net calculation.
