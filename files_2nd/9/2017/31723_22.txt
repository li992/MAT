In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy: the allocation of resources in the audit: and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Income We assessed the accounting policy for revenue recognition for compliance Refer to page 40 Audit Committee report, with accounting standards and the AIC SORP and performed testing to check page 52 and 53 Accounting Policies and that income had been accounted for in accordance with this stated accounting page 54 Notes.

We then tested the validity of special dividends to independent third party sources.
We did not find any special dividends that were not treated in accordance with the AIC SORP.
No material misstatements were identified by our testing which required reporting to those charged with governance.
Valuation and existence of investments We tested the valuation of the listed equity investments by agreeing the prices Refer to page 40 Audit Committee report, used in the valuation to independent third party sources for all quoted page 52 Accounting Policies and page 57 investments.
We tested the existence of the investment portfolio by agreeing the holdings The investment portfolio at the year-end for investments to an independent custodian confirmation from BNY Mellon.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing UK ISAs UK.
The AIFM outsources certain accounting, administrative and valuation functions to Maitland.
As part of our risk assessment, we assessed the control environment in place at both the AIFM and Maitland to the extent relevant to our audit.
This assessment involved obtaining and reading the relevant control reports, issued by the independent auditor of the AIFM and Maitland in accordance with generally accepted assurance standards for such work, to gain an understanding of both the AIFMs and Maitlands control environment and to consider the operating and accounting structure at both the AIFM and Maitland.
Following this assessment, we applied professional judgement to determine the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements.
Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall materiality 11.6 million 2016: 9.4 million.
How we determined it 1% of net assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice for investment trust audits, in the absence of indicators that an alternative benchmark would be appropriate and because we believe this provides an appropriate and consistent year-on-year basis for our audit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 582,000 2016: 468,000 as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows: Reporting obligation Outcome We are required to report if we have anything material to add or draw attention to in We have nothing material to add or to respect of the directors statement in the financial statements about whether the draw attention to.
However, because not directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting all future events or conditions can be in preparing the financial statements and the directors identification of any material predicted, this statement is not a uncertainties to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern over a period guarantee as to the Companys ability to of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.

The directors are responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Company.

The section of the Annual Report on pages 39 to 42 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
The directors statement relating to the Companys compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors Remuneration In our opinion, the part of the Directors Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
CA06 Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors Responsibilities set out on page 47, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs UK will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRCs website at: www.
This description forms part of our auditors report.
Use of this report This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
