As outlined in the remuneration policy, there will be a further two-year holding period in place for the net of tax shares after vesting.

TSR performance and Chief Executives pay The performance graph below illustrates the performance of the Company over the eight years from September 2009 to September 2017, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.
This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
In addition, the table below the graph provides a summary of the total remuneration of the Chief Executive over the same period.
For the purpose of calculating the value of the remuneration of the Chief Executive, data has been collated on a basis consistent with the single figure methodology as defined in the applicable UK directors reporting regulations.

Associated British Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Value of a hypothetical 100 investment Governance 91 At close of business on 15 September 2017, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of the Companys ordinary shares was 3158p.
During the previous 12 months, the market value ranged from 2361p to 3322p.
Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive Between 2016 and 2017, the increase in the Chief Executives salary was 2% and the average increase in salaries for our UK employees was 2%3%.
The total reward for the Chief Executive has increased since last year because the performance of the group has been particularly strong this year, resulting in a maximum payment on the financial element of the STIP.
The overall increase in expenditure on reward for all employees was 15%.
This number is based on aggregate data presented in the table below, which include increases in headcount, as it is neither practical nor worthwhile, in a decentralised group of our size, to separate the increase in expenditure on incentives and taxable benefits.
Executive directors serving as non-executive directors During the year, George Weston served as a non-executive director of Wittington Investments Limited, for which he received no compensation.
John Bason is a non-executive director and chairman of the audit committee of Compass Group PLC, for which he received a fee of 111,000 in the 2016 17 financial year.
He also served as a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas until 6 July 2017 and as chairman of the charity FareShare, but received no compensation in respect of either of these roles.
