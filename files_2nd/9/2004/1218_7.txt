Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors The directors responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors responsibilities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Companys members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. was completed on 23 December 2004, and, since trading results between 23 December 2004 and 31 December 2004 are not material, no separate disclosure on the face of the profit and loss account has been made.
In August 2004, the Group acquired Axys Design Automation Inc.
The post-acquisition results of Axys are not material and so have not been seperately disclosed on the face of the profit and loss account.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 39 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP 1 Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in the UK.
A summary of the more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied and reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18, Accounting policies, is set out below.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2004.
Intra-Group transactions and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date they are acquired.
On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill and intangible assets Purchased goodwill, being the difference between the fair value of consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from it.
Goodwill amortisation periods are determined on a case-by-case basis see note 11.
Provision is made against the carrying value of goodwill where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity is the market value of the equity at the date of completion, the fair value of share options assumed is calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon whether the directors believe any performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will become payable.
Licences and patents purchased for the use of technology are capitalised and amortised over the period in which the Group is expected to benefit from them.
These periods range from three to five years.
Where a technology agreement confers both retrospective and prospective rights, each element is valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
The retrospective element is charged to the profit and loss account immediately, whilst the prospective element is capitalised.
Trade investments Trade investments are initially recorded at cost.
There is a regular review of the carrying value of investments, with reference to relevant financial information and industry conditions: impairment charges are recorded if there is evidence of impairment in value to reduce the carrying value of the investments to the market value of the shares held.
If circumstances change such that the market value of the investment exceeds the carrying value, the impairment charged is reversed.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost.
Where an acquisition satisfies the provisions of sections 131 to 134 of the Companies Act 1985 for merger relief, the investment is stated at the nominal value of shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration.
Shortand long-term investments Bank deposits which are not repayable on demand are treated as short-term investments in accordance with FRS 1, Cash flow statements.
Movements in such investments are included under management of liquid resources in the Groups cash flow statement.
Money market instruments are included within short-term investments at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Deposits and marketable securities with maturity more than one year from the balance sheet date are shown as long-term marketable securities within fixed asset investments and are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Pension scheme arrangements The Group contributes to defined contribution plans, covering substantially all employees in Europe and the United States, and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated from the date that they come into use.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the prior period to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalised.
External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefits of the business.
The principal useful economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of tangible fixed assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport and handling costs.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks.
40 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 1 Principal accounting policies continued Turnover The Group follows the principles of FRS 5 Application Note G in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies.
In principle, therefore, revenue is recognised to the extent that the Group has obtained the right to consideration through its performance.
Turnover excluding VAT comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees ARM-based products, revenues from support, maintenance and training, and consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer.
Revenue from the sale of such licences is recognised on a  basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance.
Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the proportion of work performed calculated on the cost basis described above is greater than the proportion of the total contract value which has been invoiced, the Group evaluates whether it has obtained, through its performance to date, the right to the uninvoiced consideration and therefore whether revenue should be recognised.
In particular it considers: l whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way dependent on customer activity: l whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled: l whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future invoice may be raised: and l the extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it has the right to consideration, taking into account these criteria, revenue is not recognised until there is sufficient evidence that the Group has obtained the right to consideration for its performance under such arrangements.
If the amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, the excess amount is recorded as amounts recoverable on contracts within debtors.
Where agreements involve multiple elements, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual elements based on each elements fair value.
Vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers where elements are sold separately.
Agreements including rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognised over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product.
In those cases where the Group makes sales of these products, the total value of the licence is recorded as turnover and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Group records as turnover the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-contract support support, maintenance and training PCS which consists of an identified customer contact at the Group and telephonic or e-mail support.
Fees for post-contract support which take place after customer acceptance are specified in the contract.
Revenue related to PCS is recognised based on VSOE, which is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rates actually charged on renewal PCS arrangements for the same level of support and for the same or similar technologies.
Revenue for PCS is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Group with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees and PCS invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence such as off-the-shelf software are recognised upon delivery.
At that time, the Group has no further obligations except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post-contract support have been accrued.
Services such as training that the Group provides which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately.
Revenue is recognised as services are performed and collectability is probable.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Groups customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognised when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 41 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued As disclosed above, in accordance with FRS 18, Accounting policies, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of the  method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, customer acceptance is not uncertain.
In addition, when allocating revenue to various elements of multi-element arrangements, it is assumed that the fair value of each element is reflected by its price when sold separately.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation, using full provision accounting when an event has taken place by the balance sheet date which gives rise to an increased or reduced tax liability in the future, in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred taxation.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currency The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies are taken to reserves and reported in the statement of Group total recognised gains and losses.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences have been included in operating profit.
Financial instruments The Group attempts to reduce its foreign currency exposure by entering into forward contracts to sell US dollars and buy sterling.
The Group accounts for these instruments by revaluing the financial instruments and the associated trade debtors and cash at the year-end rate.
The resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to the profit and loss account for the year.
Research and development All research and development expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Share schemes The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are separately administered trusts which are funded by loans the ESOP and loans and gifts the QUEST from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees see note 21.
In accordance with the requirements of UITF 17, Employee share schemes, a charge is made in the profit and loss account representing the fair value at the date of grant of shares awarded under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan.
As the award is conditional on certain performance conditions being met, this is reflected in the number of shares on which the charge is calculated.
A similar charge arises on the difference between the market value of ARM's shares and the exercise price of certain options issued as part of the consideration for a business acquisition.
The charge is credited back to reserves.
The Company operates a Save As You Earn scheme together with a similar scheme for US employees that allows the grant of share options at a discount to the market price at the date of grant.
The Company has made use of the exemption under UITF 17 not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of these options.
Employers National Insurance and similar taxes arise on the exercise of certain share options.
In accordance with UITF 25, National Insurance contributions on share option gains, a provision is made, calculated using the market price of the Companys shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to the profit and loss account to match the projects related expenditure.
Provision for doubtful debts Provision is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
42 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 2 Segmental analysis The directors are of the opinion that the Group had only one class of business during 2004.
Following the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. the directors are considering whether the business is going to be re-organised and whether different reportable segments will be formed.
No indication can be given of the profit before tax or net assets of Axys since acquisition as the business and assets were integrated into existing Group operations shortly after purchase.

The differences are explained below: 2004 2003 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 42,165 23,240 Taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 30% 12,650 6,972 Effects of: Under over provision in respect of prior years 496 54 Accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences 795 1,638 Permanent differences 1,435 1,202 Higher average tax rates in overseas countries 124 8 Losses utilised during the year 354 633 Current tax charge for the year 11,284 9,225 The analysis of the deferred tax asset movement for the Group is as follows: Deferred Deferred tax asset tax asset 2004 2003 000 000 At 1 January 3,585 1,697 Asset relating to losses acquired with subsidiary undertaking see note 23 16,156 640 Credited to the profit and loss account 1,131 1,248 Foreign exchange 40 At 31 December 20,832 3,585 The analysis of deferred tax assets for the Group is as follows: Amount recognised Amount not recognised 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Tax effect of timing differences because of: Excess of tax allowances over depreciation 5,668 2,844 Losses carried forward 13,571 395 254 420 Other 1,593 346 83 20,832 3,585 254 503 Included within the amount recognised for losses carried forward is an amount of 6,385,000 2003: nil that is expected to be charged to the profit and loss account after more than one year.
No provision is made for taxation liabilities which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiaries because there is no intention in the foreseeable future that such profits will be remitted.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for the amounts unprovided because of the uncertainty of utilising these losses in the future.
The Company has no potential liability for deferred taxation.
8 Profit for the financial year As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent companys profit after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was 17,279,000 2003: 10,546,000.

As such, dividends will not be payable on the 5,713,034 shares currently held within these trusts.
10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the QUEST which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year, being those share options granted to employees and directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
For 2004, no shares that have been allocated for awards under the LTIP have been included in the diluted EPS calculation as the performance criteria cannot be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2004 2003 Number Per share Number Per share Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount 000 Thousands Pence 000 Thousands Pence Basic EPS Profit available to ordinary shareholders 32,012 1,026,890 3.1p 15,158 1,016,484 1.5p Effect of dilutive securities: Options 22,179 16,797 Diluted EPS Adjusted earnings 32,012 1,049,069 3.1p 15,158 1,033,281 1.5p 11 Intangible fixed assets Patents and licences Goodwill Total Group 000 000 000 Cost At 1 January 2004 12,900 8,124 21,024 Additions see note 23 160 459,863 460,023 Exchange differences 473 473 At 31 December 2004 13,060 467,514 480,574 Aggregate amortisation At 1 January 2004 7,444 6,033 13,477 Charge for the year 2,621 2,103 4,724 Exchange differences 35 35 At 31 December 2004 10,065 8,101 18,166 Net book value At 31 December 2004 2,995 459,413 462,408 At 31 December 2003 5,456 2,091 7,547 The Group has patents and licences which are being amortised over three to five years.

The investment was made in order to broaden the scope of the Groups collaboration with Superscape Group plc in the area of 3D technology for wireless devices.
In addition, the Group owns a less than 1% holding in CSR plc, a company that develops Bluetooth solutions that listed during the year and was owned prior to that listing.
The cost and market value of this investment as at 31 December 2004 were 688,000 2003: 688,000 and 1,467,000 respectively.
There was no readily available market value for CSR plc at 31 December 2003 as the company was an unlisted private company at that time.
On flotation, the impairment provision previously booked against this investment was released, as the flotation price exceeded original cost to the Group and the previous carrying value of the investment.
Therefore the total market value of listed investments held at 31 December 2004 was 10,262,000 2003: 4,139,000.

These are managed, respectively, through the use of hedging strategies primarily forward contracts, money market instruments and an ongoing process of assessing potential trade investments and current holdings.
To meet these objectives the Group has used the policies described below which have been applied throughout the current year.
On 23 December 2004, the Group acquired Artisan Components Inc. a company based in the US, who held significant US dollar cash and debtor balances.
Most of the policies detailed below, except where noted, applied for the legacy ARM business prior to the acquisition, and reference to year-end amounts will include Artisan balances.
The harmonisation of the legacy businesses treasury policies is ongoing.
Management of foreign exchange risk The Groups earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while the majority of its costs are settled in sterling the proportion of US dollar denominated costs for the Group going forward after the acquisition of Artisan increases from approximately 25% to approximately 45%.
The Group seeks to use forward contracts to manage the US dollar sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and value of anticipated US dollar receipts which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts in comparison with its requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars.
The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars as appropriate.
Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US dollar cash receipts.
As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group enters into forward contracts which allow exercise between two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date.
In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the foreign exchange contract, the Group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments.
It then seeks to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against forward contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the prevailing money market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time.
At 31 December 2004 the Group had outstanding forward contracts to sell $50,000,000 2003: $44,000,000.
The Group had $56,205,000 2003: $28,591,000 of trade debtors denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar cash balances and short-term investments of $176,464,000 2003: $26,340,000.
Thus 79% 2003: 20% of the Groups US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching forward contracts at the year end.
This has increased in the year due to the acquisition of Artisan which holds significant debtor and cash balances in US dollars.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro.
The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out euro forward contracts.
The Group, where required, invests profits in the subsidiary in which they were earned.
The Group does not hedge any foreign net asset investment using foreign currency loans, as there is currently no requirement for external borrowings.
The Group considers the use of other financial instruments such as currency options but did not enter into any agreements during the year.
Maximisation of return on funds held on deposit The Groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
It aims to maximise returns from funds held on deposit and uses money market deposits with major financial institutions to do so.
Recent maturities during the year have been up to six months in length although post-acquisition of Artisan there are some deposits with maturities of up to two years, but this varies since close consideration is given to the UK and US money market yield curves before contracts are closed.
Trade investments Investment activity is intended to create long-term strategic alliances with development companies, some of which may be unlisted at the time of the investment decision.
As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future market for these securities or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARMs funds.
The directors review holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group.
Funds for such ventures are strictly limited in order that the financial effect of any potential decline in the value of investments would not be substantial in the context of the Groups financial results.
The Group holds investments in two listed companies: a 12% holding in Superscape Group plc and a less than 1% holding in CSR plc.
The Group holds investments in five private companies: Pixim, Inc. CoWare, Inc. Palmchip Corporation, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, which all develop products based on ARM technology.
External borrowings At 31 December 2004, the Group owed $3.3 million 1,732,000 2003: nil extending beyond one year but less than two years from the balance sheet date being the final payment of a technology license agreement signed in the year.
No interest is payable under this arrangement.
The Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2004 2003: nil or during the financial year.
Numerical disclosures Numerical disclosures are set out in the tables below.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures.
These balances are as of 31 December in each year, and the 2004 amounts may not be reflective of the typical profile of the Group throughout the year due to the significant impact of Artisan balances on the figures at the year end.

Long-term marketable securities were placed for up to two years and earn interest of between 1.70% and 2.21%.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalents.
Financial liabilities Provisions for National Insurance and similar taxes of 27,000 2003: 63,000 are financial liabilities in sterling on which no interest is paid.
Maturity depends on when certain share options are exercised.
Fair values of financial instruments Cash and short-term investments The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Long-term investments There is a readily available market for these investments.
They are carried at cost unless the market value falls below cost in which case an impairment charge is made.
At 31 December 2004, the fair value approximates to carrying value.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates.
The fair value of forward contracts is estimated at 1,674,000 at 31 December 2004 2003: 2,015,000.
The decrease is due to the number and relative exchange rates of contracts outstanding compared to 2003.
Investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which ARM has invested are early-stage development enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits.
The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Groups investments in unlisted companies carrying value at 31 December 2004: 1,973,000 as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2004.
On this basis, the fair value of the Groups listed investments were 10,262,000 at 31 December 2004 2003: 4,139,000.
Long-term accruals The carrying amount of 1,732,000 approximates to fair value as the effect of discounting to present value is not considered material.
Provisions The carrying amount of 27,000 approximates to fair value as this is the amount which would be payable if the liability had crystallized at the balance sheet date.

3,041,914 ordinary shares of 0.05 pence each were issued in the year for cash consideration of 1,311,000 as a result of the exercise of employee share options at various times during the year.
324,399,411 ordinary shares of 0.05 pence each were issued in the year as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc.
The fair value of these shares at issue was 354,835,000.
For further information, see note 23.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 55 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 20 Called-up share capital continued Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
The schemes remained substantially the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc.
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement.
"The schemes assumed were the ""1993 Plan"", the ""1997 Plan"", the ""2000 Plan"", the ""2003 Plan"", the ""Director Plan"", the ""Executive Plan"" and the ""ND00 Plan""."
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods.
The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years.
Some options vest on a monthly basis, and some vest over five years.
All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
"The Group also operates savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Group ""SAYE""."
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is either three or five years, except under the US scheme where the period is two years.
The option price is normally 85% of the market share price at grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed, except for the US scheme where the right to exercise only arises for a three-month period.
Under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan, a further 5,003,724 shares could be awarded to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year period as detailed in the remuneration report.
These shares will be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and QUEST.

The total share consideration of 354,835,000 comprised 162,000 nominal value of 0.05 pence ordinary shares and 354,673,000 premium on those shares.
The foreign exchange reserve represents exchange differences arising on consolidation of foreign subsidiary undertakings.
The other reserve represents the fair value of share options granted to employees of Artisan Components Inc. as part consideration for the acquisition.
A total of 90.4 million options with an exercise price of between 6 pence and 107 pence were granted with fair values of between 61 pence and 104 pence valued using the Black Scholes valuation model.
Own shares held Offset in the profit and loss reserve is an amount of 7,485,000 representing the cost of own shares held.
This balance consists of own shares held by the Groups ESOP and QUEST.
The trust was set up in 1998 and purchased shares at the time of the Companys flotation using funds provided by the Company.
Conditional awards under the Groups LTIP have been granted over these shares at 31 December 2004 but no awards have been made since the trust was created.
All costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the profit and loss account as they accrue and the trust has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.

The amount varies from $nil to a maximum of $3 million.
The book value of the assets and liabilities have been taken from the management accounts of each company at the date of acquisition at actual exchange rates on that date.
Adjustments were made to the Artisan intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities to adjust its balance sheet to UK GAAP.
The fair value of options granted on the acquisition of Artisan were calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model with volatility of between 80% and 94%, an average risk-free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and a dividend yield of 0.7%.
There were no fair value adjustments for Axys as the fair value of assets and liabilities were deemed to equate to book value.
58 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 23 Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings continued Artisan's profit after tax for the year ended 30 September 2004 was 10.7 million measured under US GAAP and for the period from 1 October 2004 until acquisition was a loss of 6.1 million measured under US GAAP.
The summarised profit and loss account for the period from 1 October 2004 until acquisition on 23 December 2004 is as follows: 000 Turnover 7,654 Operating expenses 16,672 Operating loss 9,018 Interest receivable and similar income 328 Loss on ordinary activities before taxation 8,690 Tax on loss on ordinary activities 2,567 Loss for the period 6,123 Operating expenses above include 8.8 million of non-recurring acquisition and restructuring costs.
Axys' profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 13,000, and for the period from 1 January 2004 to acquisition was a loss after taxation of 874,000.
Neither acquisition made a material contribution to post-acquisition cash flows.
The acquisitions have been accounted for using acquisition accounting.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications Inc. filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomis US patent No.
ARM answered Nazomis complaint in July 2002, denying infringement.
ARM moved for summary judgement and a ruling that the accused technology does not infringe.
In September 2003, the United States District Court of Northern California granted ARMs motion, holding that the accused technology does not infringe Nazomi's patent.
Nazomi appealed the District Courts ruling.
On 7 September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and the decision of the Court is expected in the first half of 2005.
Based on legal advice received to date, ARM has no cause to believe that the effect of the original ruling by the District Court will not be upheld.

32 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP followed by the Group and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under UK GAAP which differs in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
The principal differences between the Groups accounting policies under UK GAAP and those that would have been followed had the financial information been prepared under US GAAP are set out below.
Goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over an estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from it.
This was also the Groups accounting policy under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, on which date, following the provisions of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen and became subject to annual impairment reviews.
No write-offs of goodwill have arisen as a result of the Groups initial or annual impairment reviews.
Amortisation of intangibles Under UK GAAP, intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination are included within the goodwill balance unless the asset can be identified and sold separately without disposing of the business as a whole.
Under US GAAP, such intangible assets may meet the criteria set out in SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, for categorisation as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives.
A deferred tax liability arises on the intangible assets, and is credited to the profit and loss account proportionately to the amortisation on the related intangible assets.
Under US GAAP, payments made to purchase intangible assets that are still in development are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Thus differences arise in the amounts of goodwill recognised, the associated amortisation charge and the associated deferred tax liability and income statement credit.
Valuation of consideration on business combination Under both US and UK GAAP, the fair value of consideration in a business combination includes the fair value of both equity issued and any share options granted as part of that combination, which are then used in the goodwill calculation.
Under UK GAAP, any equity issued is valued at the fair value as of the date of completion, whilst under US GAAP, the equity is valued at the date the terms of the combination were agreed to and announced.
For options, under US GAAP, the fair value is based upon the total number of options granted, both vested and unvested, whilst under UK GAAP the fair value only includes those that have vested, together with a pro-rata value for partially vested options.
Furthermore, where there is contingent consideration for an acquisition, under UK GAAP this is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent conditions are expected to be satisfied, whilst under US GAAP it is only recognised if the conditions have actually been met.
Deferred stock-based compensation Under US GAAP, the intrinsic value of unvested stock options issued by an acquirer as part of a business combination in exchange for unvested share options of the acquiree is recorded as a debit balance within shareholders funds.
This amount is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the share options in accordance with FIN 28.
Under UK GAAP, no such adjustment to shareholders funds is made on acquisition.
Although the same charge as under US GAAP is subsequently made to the profit and loss account, it is written back through reserves.
Fair values of assets and liabilities acquired The conventions under which the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination is determined differ between UK and US GAAP, eg.
in relation to the valuation of deferred revenue and related costs.
Marketable securities Under US GAAP, investments in available-for-sale securities are marked to market where the market value is readily determinable and gains and losses, net of deferred taxation, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Where an impairment is considered to be other than temporary, the security is written down through the profit and loss account to a new cost basis represented by the fair value of the security on the date the impairment was determined.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups accounting policy is to carry such investments at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under UK GAAP, the fair value of the shares awarded under the LTIP is charged to compensation cost over the period in respect of which performance conditions apply.
To the extent the award is adjusted by virtue of performance conditions being met or not, the compensation cost is adjusted in line with this.
Under US GAAP, the Group follows variable plan accounting for these grants, measuring compensation expense as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at each period end over the vesting period of the options.
Increases in fair market value of the shares result in a charge and decreases in fair market value of the shares result in a credit, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 61 Notes to the financial statements UK GAAP continued 32 Summary of significant differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP followed by the Group and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP continued Save As You Earn SAYE plans Under UK GAAP, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption provided by UITF 17, Employee share schemes, not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of options granted under SAYE plans.
Under US GAAP, the Group follows the requirements of EITF 00-23, which does not permit such an exemption in respect of plans where the savings period is in excess of 27 months, as is the case with the Groups Inland Revenue approved UK SAYE plans.
EITF 00-23 applies only to new offers made since 24 January 2002.
The compensation charge made under US GAAP is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straightline basis over the savings period.
In addition, certain options attract a charge under variable plan accounting under US GAAP.
Employer taxes on share options Under UK GAAP, employers taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting period of the options.
Under US GAAP such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.
Tax on UK and US share options In the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as compensation under US tax rules for certain employee share options, which have been exercised during the year.
Similarly, in the UK, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the profit made by employees on certain options that have been exercised during the year.
In both cases, the amount is equivalent to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise.
Under UK GAAP the tax benefit arising from this deduction is included in the tax charge in the profit and loss account whilst under US GAAP, the tax benefit is recorded as an increase in shareholders funds.
Embedded derivatives Under US GAAP, where the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer and where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, such derivatives are carried at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives are not revalued to fair value under UK GAAP.
Cash and cash equivalents Under UK GAAP, cash does not include short-term deposits and investments which cannot be withdrawn without notice and without incurring a penalty.
Such items are shown as short-term investments.
Under US GAAP, deposits with a maturity of less than three months at inception which are convertible into known amounts of cash are included as cash and cash equivalents.
Deposits with a maturity at inception of between three months and one year are shown as short-term investments.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared under UK GAAP presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, management of liquid resources and financing activities.
US GAAP, however, requires only three categories of cash flow activity to be reported: operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance shown under UK GAAP are included as operating activities under US GAAP.
Dividends payable Under UK GAAP, dividends declared after the period end are recorded in the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, they are recorded in the period in which they are declared.

The matters addressed in this operating and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs high-performance, low-cost, power-efficient reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors and related technology and software, and licenses this IP to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard products ASSPs based on the ARM architecture to systems companies.
ARM also licenses and sells development systems directly to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other system designers.
ARM has developed an innovative,  centred and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Market conditions After strong year-on-year growth for the semiconductor industry in 2004, current expectations for 2005 are that there will be little or no growth over 2004.
Despite this likely flatter trading environment, we expect 2005 to be a year of growth in dollar revenues for the Company.
Both the former ARM and Artisan stand-alone businesses enter 2005 with healthy order backlogs and sales pipelines which will underpin licensing revenues in 2005.
In addition, both companies continue to enjoy good momentum in royalty revenues based on the increasing adoption of ARM and Artisan technology by semiconductor and OEM companies in recent years.
The healthy order backlog and sales pipeline and strong momentum in royalty revenues gives confidence that dollar revenues in both underlying businesses are capable of growing in 2005.
The Company remains exposed to any further weakening in the US dollar against sterling given that more than 90% of total Company revenues are earned in US dollars.
Following the acquisition of Artisan, approximately 45% of the Companys cost base will be incurred in US dollars, compared to approximately 25% for ARM prior to the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company has been profitable and robustly cash generative before investing activities, with net cash inflows from operating activities of 46.5 million, giving rise to a year-end cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balance of 142.8 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of income.

Revenues, expressed in dollars using applicable exchange rates for invoicing in currencies other than dollars, were $272.4 million in 2004, an increase of 32% over the $206.5 million in 2003.
The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2004 was $1.83 compared with the effective average rate for ARM of $1.78 compared with $1.64 in 2003.
This had the effect of reducing total reported revenues by approximately 13.2 million.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 65 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties.
Product revenues for 2002, 2003 and 2004 were 132.9 million, 113.0 million and 138.7 million, representing 88%, 88% and 91% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues decreased from 83.0 million in 2002 to 50.8 million in 2003, and then increased to 59.4 million in 2004 representing approximately 55%, 40% and 39% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Licensing activity in 2004 demonstrated both the breadth of ARM's technology offer as well as the longevity of the products.
Our partners have now been licensing products in the ARM7 family for more than 11 years, including an incremental 15 ARM7 licenses in 2004 and accounting for 9% of licensing revenues in 2004, compared with 18% in 2003 and 15% in 2002.
There have been 31 new licenses for ARM9 products in 2004.
Revenues from the ARM9 family have declined though, accounting for 43% of licensing revenues in 2002, 31% in 2003 and 23% in 2004.
Although these proportions for ARM7 and ARM9 have fallen in 2004, we expect to see the licensing of both families of products for some time, demonstrating the relevance of having leading-edge technology at all performance points in the embedded microprocessor space.
There are a growing number of cores available to license from the Company, including four products in the ARM11 family, offering many new security and power management features and OptimoDE, the embedded signal processing technology discussed below.
"The Company has also signed initial partners for the next generation of ARM technologies, currently known as ""Tiger"" and ""ServalE""."
65 new licenses were signed in 2004 compared to 51 in 2003 comprising 31 multi-use licenses and 34 per-use licenses.
15 of these licenses were for ARM11 products bringing the total number of ARM11 licenses signed to date to 25.
ARM11 accounted for 17% of licensing revenue in 2004, compared to 10% in 2003 and 5% in 2002.
15 companies became new ARM partners during 2004 bringing the total number to 140 at the end of 2004.
This total number of semiconductor partners was net of those companies that have signed licenses with ARM in the past but have since been acquired by other companies or who no longer have access to ARM technology for other reasons.
A significant proportion of licensing was to existing partners taking licenses to new core families not previously licensed or derivatives of cores already licensed.
The sale of non-core licenses, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, models, and sub-systems, increased in 2004 to 10.5 million from 8.9 million in 2003 and down from 12.6 million in 2002 representing approximately 18% of license revenues in 2004, 18% in 2003 and 15% in 2002.
An embedded software group within ARM was established in 2004 in order to capitalize on opportunities to generate revenue from software.
This group is intended to drive growth in embedded software revenue, build on the strong foundation of the existing Java, Intelligent Energy Manager, TrustZone and Swerve product families and bring more focus to the development of enabling software technology to support further growth of licensing, development systems and data engines revenues.
An example of the initiatives being undertaken by this unit is the announcement in 2004 of the development by ARM and Trusted Logic, the embedded systems security experts, of a new TrustZone technology optimized software solution to increase security for the mobile industry.
ARM expects the new software to increase electronic transaction security on ARM Powered mobile phones, set-top boxes and other consumer devices.
Following the acquisition of Adelante Technologies N. V. now ARM Belgium N. V. in July 2003, ARM formally announced the launch of its OptimoDE embedded signal processing technology at the Embedded Processor Forum in May 2004.
ARM has introduced this technology to address the processing requirements of very data intensive consumer applications which are often outstripping the capabilities of general-purpose digital signal processors.
The OptimoDE product, which comprises a configurable data engine signal processor together with related intellectual property and tools, will be deployed in systems alongside existing ARM microprocessor cores and other ARM technology, including the Axys electronic system level design tools, acquired in August 2004.
Revenues from the sale of development systems decreased from 23.1 million in 2002 to 17.9 million in 2003, but increased to 19.7 million in 2004 representing approximately 15%, 14% and 13% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
The majority of ARMs sales of development systems are in US dollars and the US dollar value of sales of development systems in 2003 was approximately 16% lower than in 2002, but was 24% higher in 2004 compared to 2003.
Sales of development systems continued to be affected by increased competition in the debug tools marketplace.
The new management team and increased resources assigned to assist the development of the development systems business have continued to yield improvements in results through 2004 and this is expected to continue into 2005.
In August 2004, ARM added electronic system level ESL expertise to its RealView design tools portfolio with the announcement of the acquisition of Axys Design Automation, Inc. a provider of fast, accurate, integrated processor and system modelling and simulation solutions.
Axys ESL products reduce overall system costs by allowing designs to be modelled early in the development cycle, decreasing time-to-market and minimizing design errors.
Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensees net sales price per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the Company receives notification from the customer of product sales.
In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data is received and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the current year.
Royalties increased from 26.8 million in 2002 to 44.3 million in 2003, and increased further to 59.6 million in 2004, representing 18%, 34% and 39% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Volume shipments increased from 456 million units in 2002 to 782 million units in 2003, mainly due to increased production of a wide range of electronic devices, including wireless handsets, secure products and automotive products.
Unit shipments in 2004 were 1,272 million, with the increase in volumes coming from all market segments, especially consumer entertainment and storage products.
The Company has become less reliant on the wireless sector with more than 400 million non-wireless units being shipped in the year.
The Company expects the trend of increasing proportions of unit shipments into the non-wireless markets to continue into 2005.
The Company expects royalty revenues to grow year on year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
The total number of partners shipping ARM technology-based product at the end of 2004 was 60 after taking into account corporate activity within the ARM partnership.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training.
Service revenues decreased from 18.0 million in 2002 to 15.1 million in 2003 to 14.2 million in 2004, representing 12%, 12% and 9% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Consulting revenues decreased from 4.4 million in 2002 to 2.4 million in 2003 and 2.1 million in 2004, as engineering resource was directed away from consulting projects to research and development activities.
Revenues from support, maintenance and training decreased from 13.6 million in 2002 to 12.7 million in 2003 and 12.1 million in 2004.
Actual US dollar revenues increased by 3% from 2003 to 2004 but this has been offset by the weakening of the dollar against sterling in 2004.
66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Companys revenues fluctuate from period to period depending upon the country of origin of its customers.
The pattern of revenues in 2004 was 51% of revenues coming from the US, 21% from Japan, 13% from Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, and 15% from Europe.
In 2003, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 19%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 12%, and Europe 18%.
In 2002, revenues from the US represented 44%, Japan 25%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 13%, and Europe 18%.
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of development systems, amortization of our thirdparty technology licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners.
Product costs were 6.5 million in 2002, 6.2 million in 2003 and 6.7 million in 2004 representing 4%, 5% and 4% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Approximately two-thirds of total product cost of sales were made up of development systems costs in 2004, with the balance comprising additional costs related to the costs of third-party licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners.
This is comparable to the level in both 2002 and 2003, with the balance being costs associated with third-party licenses.
Product gross margin in 2004 was 95%, compared to 95% in 2003 and 95% in 2002.
The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in product costs in 2005, although this would be subject to significant fluctuations if management were obliged to port further operating systems to run on the ARM architecture.
Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to consulting work performed for third parties.
Cost of services decreased from approximately 6.7 million in 2002 to 4.9 million in 2003 and was 5.1 million in 2004.
The gross margins earned on service revenues were approximately 63% in 2002, 68% in 2003 and 64% in 2004.
In 2003 and 2004, the Company elected to allocate more engineering resource to research and development activities, thus enabling the Company to develop more innovative products and technologies during the year.
Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from 47.3 million in 2002 to 48.1 million in 2003 and 50.1 million in 2004, representing 31%, 38% and 33% of total revenues in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Continued investment in research and development remains an essential part of the Companys strategy since the development of new products to license is key to its ongoing success.
Total engineering headcount increased from 420 at the end of 2002 to 442 at the end of 2003, and was 739 at the end of 2004.
The increase in 2003 was predominantly due to the acquisition of ARM Belgium N. V. whilst the increase in 2004 was due to the acquisitions of both Artisan and Axys as well as some growth within the existing business.
Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure decreased from 24.7 million in 2002 to 23.0 million in 2003 and was 23.9 million in 2004, representing 16% of total revenues in 2002, 18% in 2003, and 16% in 2004.
Headcount in this area decreased from 208 at 31 December 2002 to 203 at 31 December 2003 and was 282 at the end of 2004.
Most of the growth in 2004 has come from acquisitions but there has also been organic growth with new offices opening in Bangalore, India and Beijing, PR China.
The total number of sales offices is currently 19 and this enables improved contact with the Companys geographically diverse customer base.
General and administrative General and administrative headcount at 31 December 2004 was 150, up from 95 at the end of 2003 and 93 at the end of 2002.
Again, the majority of the increase in 2004 has come from acquisitions.
General and administrative costs were 22.5 million in 2002 and increased to 28.7 million in 2003 and 31.3 million in 2004, representing 15%, 22% and 20% of total revenues respectively.
Costs in 2003 included 1.6 million of impairments made to investments 2002: 0.8 million, 2004: nil.
Legal costs fluctuated from 2.5 million in 2002 to 9.1 million in 2003 and 5.1 million in 2004, largely as a result of annual variations in the amount of legal expenses relating to patent protection cases and other similar costs.
The primary reason for the increase in legal costs from 2002 to 2003 was the provision in 2003 for settlement of the Herodion arbitration which was paid early in 2004.
4.5 million of the costs in 2004 related to a technology license agreement signed in the year.
Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts was 1.4 million in 2002, a release of 0.1 million in 2003 and a further release of 0.1 million in 2004.
Unrealized future foreign exchange losses on certain committed but not yet invoiced future revenue streams of 0.7 million 2003: 1.1 million: 2002: 1.0 million were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133.
There was a gain on foreign exchange of 0.5 million in 2002, a gain of 0.9 million in 2003 and a loss of 1.5 million in 2004.
See foreign currency fluctuations below.
In-process research and development During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. now ARM Physical IP Inc.. Those intangible assets that were still in development known as in-process research and development were charged directly to the income statement, amounting to 0.4 million and 3.2 million for Axys and Artisan respectively.
Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets Various licenses to use third-party technology have been signed over the past several years, with their values being capitalized and amortized over the useful economic period that the Company is expected to gain benefit from them generally between three and five years.
In addition to the three licenses purchased in 2000, 2001 and 2002, two licenses were purchased in 2003 totalling 0.7 million and a further license purchased in 2004 for 0.2 million.
Amortization of these licenses amounted to 0.5 million in 2004 2003: 1.2 million: 2002: 1.1 million.
Following the out-of-court settlement of the Companys litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights to the Company for a payment of 7.5 million.
This is being amortized over four years and 1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002, 2.0 million in 2003 and 2.0 million in 2004.
The Company also purchased a patent for 0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years.
The amortization charge was 0.1 million in 2002, 2003 and 2004.
During 2003, the Company purchased Adelante Technologies N. V. now ARM Belgium N. V..
Included with the assets purchased were 0.3 million of intangible assets comprising developed technology and customer relationships which are being amortized over five years and two years respectively.
The amortization charge for the assets during 2004 was 0.1 million 2003: less than 0.1 million.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 67 Operating and financial review and prospects US GAAP continued Intangible assets acquired and capitalized as part of the Axys and Artisan business combinations totalled 1.9 million and 70.1 million respectively and are being amortised over five years and between one and six years respectively see note 6 for further details.
The total charge during 2004 was 0.1 million and 0.3 million for Axys and Artisan respectively.
The adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and other intangible assets, in 2002 did not result in any impairment of the Companys goodwill or intangible assets.
During the year, the Company entered into a technology license agreement under which ARM will pay $13.3 million 6.9 million in four equal, semiannual installments over two years.
The first installment was paid during the year and the remainder is included with creditors.
The agreement confers both retrospective and prospective rights, each of which has been valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis, and the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each element based on the relative fair values.
The retrospective amount, amounting to 4.5 million, has been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year, and the prospective element, amounting to 2.4 million, has been accounted for as a prepayment at 31 December 2004.
Interest Interest receivable increased from 4.4 million in 2002 to 4.8 million in 2003 and further to 6.9 million in 2004.
The growth in interest in the periods was due to higher average cash balances and increasing interest rates.
The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to six months during 2004 although some marketable securities acquired with Artisan have maturities of greater than one year from the balance sheet date.
Income before income tax Income before income tax was 45.4 million in 2002, 22.0 million in 2003 and 38.5 million in 2004, representing 30%, 17% and 25% of total revenues respectively.
The drop in margins in 2003 was due to lower revenues and higher legal costs including one-off settlement costs not being entirely offset by reduced other operating expenses.
The increased margin in 2004 was achieved, notwithstanding non-recurring and acquisitionrelated charges of 8.7 million during the year comprising 4.5 million of a non-recurring technology license charge, 3.6 million of in-process research and development write-off and 0.6 million of business combination intangible amortization due to higher revenue and continued cost control.
Tax charge The Companys effective tax rates were 30.3% in 2002, 40.7% in 2003 and 27.2% in 2004.
The effective tax rate increased in 2003 due to the impact of certain cash and non-cash accounting charges not being deductible for tax purposes, but fell in 2004 with additional costs being allowable for research and development tax credits, additional benefits arising from employee share option exercises and lower non-deductible non-cash accounting charges in 2004.
Net income Net income was 31.6 million in 2002, 13.0 million in 2003 and 28.0 million in 2004.
The changes in net income are as a result of the combined movements in revenues and costs as discussed above.
Liquidity and capital resources The Companys operating activities generated net cash of 39.5 million, 38.7 million and 46.5 million in 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
Movements of working capital detailed below are per the cash flow and thus exclude balances acquired through business combinations, except where noted.
Accounts receivable fell by 2.9 million in 2002, a further 4.5 million in 2003 but increased by 1.4 million in 2004.
This is partly due to the overall revenues earned in the periods towards the end of the respective years and also improved credit control throughout the periods.
Prepaid expenses increased by 5.3 million in 2002, fell by 2.8 million in 2003 and increased again by 3.4 million in 2004.
The Company entered into several leases for design automation tools during 2002, which resulted in the large increase in prepaid expenses, but fell in 2003 as a result of the lease payments being for shorter prepaid periods than in previous years.
This has been similar in 2004 and the increase was due to a technology license agreement signed in the year giving rise to a prepayment as noted above.
Accounts payable increased by 2.4 million in 2002, reduced by 2.5 million in 2003 and increased again in 2004 by 1.2 million, as a result of the timing of receipt of supplier invoices in 2004 and a general increase in the Company's cost base.
Accrued liabilities reduced by 1.1 million in 2002, increased by 7.0 million in 2003 and increased by a further 2.8 million in 2004.
The significant increase in 2003 was primarily as a result of the provision for the Herodion legal settlement of 6.4 million which was paid early in 2004, and increased in 2004 as a result of provisions for staff costs and for a technology license agreement signed in the year.
At 31 December 2004, the Company recorded approximately 21.4 million in deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be recognized as revenues in varying amounts after 31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2002, the Company recorded approximately 11.1 million and 14.4 million respectively in deferred revenues.
Deferred revenues are an element of customer backlog, and represent amounts invoiced to customers not yet recognized as revenues in the income statement.
As such, this balance fluctuates due to the maturity profile of ARM's products, and invoicing milestones within contracts.
The significant increase in 2004 is predominantly due to the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure.
Capital expenditure in 2004 was 5.0 million, compared with 3.6 million in 2003 and 15.6 million in 2002.
Capital expenditure in 2003 was much lower than in 2002 as a result of the increased leasing of design automation tools and the much lower level of recruitment which required computers to be purchased for new staff.
Capital expenditure increased in 2004 with increases in both levels of staff and as a result of the development of a new IT system.
In 2002, 8.2 million was spent on computer equipment and software and 7.4 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
In 2003, 1.8 million was spent on computer equipment and software and 1.8 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
In 2004, 3.5 million was spent on computer equipment and software and 1.5 million on leasehold improvements and fixtures and fittings.
In 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority interest in ARM Korea Limited for cash consideration of 3.0 million, bringing its holding to 100%.
The Company also acquired the entire share capital of Adelante Technologies N. V. now ARM Belgium N. V. for a total consideration of 0.4 million.
68 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 In 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of both Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. for total consideration of 6.9 million and 481.7 million respectively with cash consideration comprising 6.9 million and 122.3 million respectively.
A further $3 million 1.6 million may become payable for Axys subject to the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones.
Cash acquired with these businesses amounted to 82.7 million.
The Company envisages making further strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can broaden its product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved significantly.
In 2002, the Company made one investment in an available-for-sale security, namely Superscape Group plc, for consideration of 1.5 million.
In 2003 the Company invested a further 1.2 million in Superscape Group plc as part of a further funding round, thus maintaining its 12% holding.
In 2004, the Company invested a total of 0.2 million in two small unlisted companies, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, giving a minority holding of less than 3% in each company.
Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balances at 31 December 2004 were 142.8 million compared to 159.8 million at 31 December 2003.
Accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful debts were 17.3 million at 31 December 2003 and 34.3 million at 31 December 2004.
The significant increase in 2004 is due to the inclusion of the Artisan accounts receivable at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Companys earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Companys revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are in sterling.
The Company reduces this US dollar sterling exposure where possible by currency hedging.
Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual licenses and the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a  basis.
It then hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks.
The average size of each forward contract was $7.2 million in 2002, $4.6 million in 2003 and $5.1 million in 2004.
The Company does not currently use any other financial instruments or derivatives, although the Company is reviewing the use of other financial instruments such as currency options.
The fair values of the financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004 are disclosed in note 14 to the financial statements.
The settlement period of the forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2004 was between 11 January 2005 and 29 March 2005.
Quantitative and qualitative information on market risk During the preceding fiscal year, the Company was exposed to foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling.
ARM transacts business in approximately eight foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to the Company's operations were the US dollar, the euro, the Korean won and the Japanese yen in 2004.
For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefits from a weaker sterling and is adversely affected by a stronger sterling relative to those foreign currencies.
The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2004, 2003 and 2002, using a modelling technique that measures the changes in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to sterling with all other variables held constant.
The analysis covers all of the Company's foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures.
The foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at 31 December 2004, 2003 and 2002.
The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of ARM's foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of exposures, of 8.6 million at 31 December 2004 2003: 0.7 million, 2002: 0.2 million.
The increase in 2004 is due to the large dollar cash balances within Artisan at the year end.
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition.
The Company believes that its future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors.
These include the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Companys semiconductor partners and sudden technological change in the microprocessor industry.
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees, management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions.
Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Companys annual report on Form 20-F.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 73 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies ARM or the Company design reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessors and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-efficiency of high-volume embedded applications.
The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits ASICs and application-specific standard processors ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
By creating a network of Partners, and working with them to best utilize the Companys technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including smart cards and digital video.
The Company also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers.
The Companys principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.
The Company was formed on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer UK Limited and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc.
Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.
The Companys wholly-owned undertakings include ARM Limited incorporated in the UK, ARM, Inc. incorporated in the US, ARM Physical IP Inc. formerly Artisan Components Inc. incorporated in the US and acquired and renamed during 2004, Axys Design Automation Inc. incorporated in the US and acquired during 2004, ARM KK incorporated in Japan, ARM Korea Limited incorporated in South Korea, ARM France SAS incorporated in France, ARM Belgium N. V. incorporated in Belgium, ARM Taiwan Limited incorporated in Taiwan, ARM Consulting Shanghai Co. Limited incorporated in PR China and ARM Embedded Solutions Pvt.
Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States US GAAP.
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in UK sterling.
Purely for the convenience of the reader, the 31 December 2004 consolidated financial statements have been translated from sterling at the closing rate per the Financial Times on 31 December 2004 of 1.00 $1.92.
Such translations should not be construed as representations that the sterling amounts represent, or have been or could be so converted into US dollars at that rate or at any other rate.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Significant estimates in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, accounting for investments, allowance for doubtful debts, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and contingencies and legal settlements.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
115, Accounting for certain investments in debt and securities, and are carried at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income.
Other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized gains and losses of such securities are reported in earnings.
Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value: at 31 December 2004 and 2003, the estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management.
During 2002, the Company made a 12% investment in Superscape Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company made an additional investment in Superscape Group plc during 2003 maintaining its percentage shareholding.
In 2004, the Company made a less than 1% investment in Zeevo Inc. and a less than 3% investment in Reciva Limited.
Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them.
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, management is primarily responsible for determining the fair value of intangible assets.
Such assets are capitalized and amortized over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected to benefit from them, with the exception of in-process research and development which is written off immediately.
Where a technology confers both retrospective and prospective rights, each element is valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis.
The retrospective element is charged to the income statement immediately, whilst the prospective element is capitalized.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired.
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company was expected to benefit from it.
Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on 1 January 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill.
The value of goodwill carried forward at the end of 2001 has been frozen at 2,274,000 and goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually.
The Company performs its annual impairment 74 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued review at the reporting unit level.
For 2004, all the assets and liabilities of the Company were assigned to one reporting unit.
An annual impairment review in 2004 determined, by way of a comparison of the Companys market capitalization to shareholders equity and cash flow forecasts, that there was no indication of impairment with respect to goodwill.
Impairment charges The Company reviews long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and related goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would be recognized, and the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the Companys intellectual property IP, which is customized to each customers manufacturing process.
The Company receives royalties on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and consultancy services.
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, ASICs and ASSPs based on the Companys architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products.
The Companys IP consists of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software.
Most licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application.
In general, the time between the signing of a license and final customer acceptance is between six and 15 months.
Upgrades or modifications to the licensed IP are not provided.
Following customer acceptance, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts, when license agreements include deliverables that require significant production, modification or customization, contract accounting is applied.
Revenues from license fees are recognized based on the  method over the period from signing of the license to customer acceptance and the completion of all outstanding obligations.
The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement and the  achieved.
The  is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Revenues are recognized only when collectability is probable.
If the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed to customers, the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable.
Estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization, delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management.
Under the  method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product.
In accordance with SOP 97-2, Software revenue recognition, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require significant production, modification or customization, the Company recognizes license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been shipped or electronically delivered, the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
Where agreements include multiple elements, the revenue recognition criteria for each element are typically met within the same reporting period, ie.
on delivery of the elements.
If an element is undelivered at a period end, the Company determines whether it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value in order to make an allocation amongst the elements.
With the exception of post-contract support PCS, the Company does not currently believe that it has sufficient VSOE to make such allocations.
Accordingly, no revenue is recognized on arrangements where deliverables other than PCS remain outstanding.
PCS consists of an identified customer contact at the Company, and telephone or e-mail support including certain bug fixes.
PCS is generally priced separately from the initial licensing fee.
Revenue allocated to PCS is determined based on VSOE.
VSOE is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rate actually charged on renewal for the same level of support and for the same or similar technologies for PCS arrangements.
PCS revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the Company with the licensee.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Company and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licenses to the product.
In those cases where the Company makes sales of these products and considers itself to be the principal under EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the total value of the license is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales.
Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Company records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery.
Where necessary, and in the circumstances permitted by SOP 97-2, the costs associated with providing post-contract support have been accrued.
While some arrangements with distributors provide very limited rights of return, the Companys history is that actual returns are negligible and accordingly no provisions are deemed necessary.
Services, such as consulting and training, which are not essential to the functionality of the IP, are accounted for separately based on VSOE.
Revenue is recognized as services are performed and collectability is probable.
The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 75 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Companys customers of products containing ARM technology.
Revenues are recognized when ARM receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenues from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, are recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled.
For longer-term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenues are recognized on a  basis as milestones are achieved.
This method approximates to percentage to completion based on labor inputs.
Where the Company enters into a license arrangement in exchange for a license to the customers technology, in the absence of evidence of fair value of the arrangement, the transaction is recorded at carry-over basis.
Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Costs include salaries, relevant EDA tools costs and other directly related expenditure as well as a proportion of central facilities costs.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European Union.
The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements.
Grants received are intended to cover 50% of expected project costs.
Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred.
Unconditional undertakings have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received.
Amounts receivable under these arrangements in the year ended 31 December 2004 were 338,000 2003: 226,000: 2002: 199,000 and were netted against related research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel.
The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004 were 1,894,000, 1,848,000 and 2,067,000 respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three months but less than one year to be short-term investments.
Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year are classified as long-term.
At 31 December 2004 and 2003, all of the Companys investments were classified as available-for-sale and were recorded on the balance sheets at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recorded in comprehensive income.
The Company recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of its investments below cost is judged to be other-than-temporary.
Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed into operational use, are capitalized.
External costs and internal costs are capitalized to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the business.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Freehold buildings 25 years Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter Computers and software Three to five years Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of property and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Currency translation The functional currency for the Companys operations is the local currency in which each operation operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year.
Translation differences are taken to the cumulative translation adjustment.
76 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
The Companys forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
Because the Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative costs in the income statement.
The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency typically US dollars that is neither the functional currency of the Company nor the functional currency of the customer.
In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value.
The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement under general and administrative costs.
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method.
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2004 excludes incremental shares of approximately 38,143,000 2003: 18,948,000: 2002: 19,608,000 related to employee stock options.
These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
The ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee stock-based compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for stock issued to employees, and related interpretations.
Stock-based employee compensation cost in respect of certain SAYE options see below of 341,000 2003: 310,000 and in respect of the LTIP of 619,000 2003: 241,000 is reflected in net income.
No compensation cost is recorded in respect of the other stock option plans, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Apart from certain options issued to executive directors, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options.
For executive directors, discretionary share options of up to two times base salary may be issued each year that will vest after seven years.
If, however, the Company achieves defined levels of EPS growth above the rate of inflation over a period of three years, then the options are exercisable after three years.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 77 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued The Company operates Save As You Earn SAYE schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP in the US.
Options under these schemes are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which stipulates that the savings period must be at least 36 months.
During 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus, contained within EITF 00-23, that savings plans which have a savings period in excess of 27 months should be treated as compensatory.
In accordance with EITF 00-23, which applies to new offers after 24 January 2002, the Company has recognized a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans offered since that date.
The compensation charge is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period.
In addition, the EITF reached a consensus that an employers offer to enter into a new SAYE contract at a lower price than an existing contract causes variable accounting for all existing awards subject to the offer.
Variable accounting commences for all existing awards when the offer is made, and for those awards that are retained by employees because the offer is declined, variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, or expire unexercised.
New awards are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are canceled.
The compensation charge recorded in 2004 as a result of these provisions is 115,000 2003: 109,000: 2002: nil and is included within the charge disclosed above.
The number of options to which variable accounting applies is approximately 908,000 2003: 950,000: 2002: 980,000.
The Company has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognize a compensation charge under the EITF, calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the period end, over the vesting period of the options.
As part of the consideration for Artisan, the Company granted approximately 90.4 million options over shares in ARM Holdings plc to employees of Artisan with substantially the same terms of those enjoyed when they were options over Artisan shares.
As a result, a significant proportion of the options were already vested at acquisition.
The intrinsic value of the unvested options was recorded as a reduction in shareholders' funds and a reduction in goodwill.
This amount is then charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options.
The total value deferred at 31 December 2004 was 9,579,000.
Employee share ownership plans Treasury stock represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust ESOP and the QUEST.
The ESOP was set up on 16 April 1998 to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees.
Under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan, 5,003,724 shares could be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and QUEST.
The market value of unearned shares at 31 December 2004 was 5,525,000.
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held.
For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they vest unconditionally.
Treasury stock held also includes 6,047,000 relating to 713,034 shares held by the Companys QUEST, which was established by the Company during 1999.
The Company established the QUEST to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
No shares were purchased in 2004, 2003 or 2002.
The shares rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares.
They will be allocated to employees and directors to satisfy their options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes or utilized to meet awards under the Companys LTIP.
During 2004, 8,046 shares 2003: 1,075,674 were allocated from the QUEST following the exercise of share options granted under the Companys SAYE schemes.
Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the income statement as they accrue.
Employers taxes on share options Employers National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions.
In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employers taxes on these share options.
These amounts will be recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF Issue No.
03-01, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments EITF 03-01.
The consensus clarified the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity investments accounted for under SFAS No.
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and other investments accounted for under the cost method.
The recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached in March 2004 is to be applied to other-than-temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2004.
In September 2004, the FASB issued a final FASB Staff Position that delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance for all investments within the scope of EITF 03-01.
The consensus reached in March 2004 also provided for certain disclosure requirements associated with cost method investments that were effective for fiscal years ending after 15 June 2004.
The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this recognition and measurement guidance.
78 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued In April 2004, the EITF issued Statement No.
03-06 Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FASB Statement No.
EITF 03-06 addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock.
The issue also provides further guidance in applying the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two-class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating, including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security.
EITF 03-06 became effective during the quarter ended 30 June 2004, the adoption of which did not have an impact on the calculation of earnings per share of the Company.
In July 2004, the EITF issued a draft abstract for EITF Issue No.
04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share EITF 04-08.
EITF 04-08 reflects the Task Forces tentative conclusion that contingently convertible debt should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met.
If adopted, the consensus reached by the Task Force in this Issue will be effective for reporting periods ending after 15 December 2004.
Prior period earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes would be required to be restated to conform to this consensus and the Company would be required to include the shares issuable upon the conversion of debt in the diluted earnings per share computation for all periods during which such debt is outstanding.
The Company will evaluate the effect of adopting the recognition and measurement guidance when the final consensus is reached.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123 R, a revision to FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
The standards effective date will apply to awards that are granted, modified, or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
This standard eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation using the intrinsic value-based method under APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
It requires the Company to calculate equity-based compensation expense for stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant.
Currently, the Company discloses the pro forma net income loss and related pro forma income loss per share information in accordance with FAS 123 and FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Costs-Transition and Disclosure.
The Company will continue to evaluate the impact that this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations.

Such benefits are reflected as additional paid-in capital.
Also included in the provision for income taxes is a release of deferred tax liability in relation to acquired intangibles of 188,000 2003: nil: 2002: nil.
Total income tax expense differs from the amounts computed by applying the UK statutory income tax rate of 30% for 2004, 2003 and 2002 to income before income tax as a result of the following: Year ended 31 December 2002 2003 2004 000 000 000 UK statutory rate 30% 2003: 30%: 2002: 30% 13,627 6,588 11,537 Permanent differences other 186 1,803 177 Differences in statutory rates of foreign countries 115 92 231 Other, net 143 460 1,467 13,785 8,943 10,478 Permanent differences comprise permanent adjustments and the UK research and development tax credit.

If these earnings were to be remitted without offsetting tax credits in the UK, withholding taxes would be approximately 1,122,000 2003: 347,000: 2002: 518,000.
The valuation allowance relates to net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believes it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized.
None of the loss carryforwards expires before 2018.
The future use of the net operating losses carried forward in ARM Inc. may be restricted in the event of a purchase by a third party, whereby the level of losses to be utilized on an annual basis would be limited to 4% of the market value of ARM Inc. at the date of the transaction.
There is no such restriction on the losses carried forward in ARM Belgium N.

Significant technological changes in the industry could affect operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities and accounts receivable.
The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the Companys customers are large, well-established companies.
The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions.
For further information see footnote 13.
At 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004, no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
As of 31 December 2002 and 2003, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits for varying periods of up to six months.
At 31 December 2004, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities were deposited with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods of up to two years.
6 Acquisitions Axys Design Automation Inc. On 16 August 2004, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc. a US company, for a total consideration of $12.5 million 6.9 million, comprising $11.6 million cash consideration and $0.9 million of related acquisition expenses.
The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.
A further $3 million is potentially payable subject to the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones and will be accrued when payable.
Axys is a provider of fast, accurate, integrated, processor and system modeling and simulation solutions and adds electronic system level expertise to ARM's design tools portfolio.
The operating results for Axys have been included in these financial statements for the period from 16 August 2004 to 31 December 2004.
The acquisition was accounted for under SFAS 141.
The following table sets out the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: Fair value 000 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 107 Accounts receivable, net 270 Other debtors 74 Deferred tax asset 710 Property and equipment, net 50 Total assets acquired 1,211 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other creditors 17 Accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 729 Total liabilities assumed 746 Net assets acquired 465 82 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 6 Acquisitions continued The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Axys and those intangible assets of Axys that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Axys concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Axys clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 465 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 5 1,379 Customer relationships 5 425 Trademarks 596 In-process research and development written-off on acquisition 383 Deferred tax liability 760 Goodwill 4,914 Purchase price 6,902 The companys profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2003 was 0.02 million and for the period from 1 January 2004 until acquisition was a loss of 0.9 million.
"Artisan Components Inc. On 23 December 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc. a leading provider of physical IP components for the design and manufacture of complex system-on-chip ""SoC"" integrated circuits."
The acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry's broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base, with highly complementary sales channels combining ARM's channel to more than 140 silicon manufacturers with Artisan's channel to more than 2,000 companies.
It better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases, and strengthens the links between the key aspects of SoC development, enabling the combined company to deliver solutions that are further optimized for power and performance.
The operating results for Artisan have been included in these financial statements for the period from 23 December 2004 to 31 December 2004.
The total consideration paid was $926.9 million 481.7 million, comprising cash of $235.4 million 122.3 million, 324,399,411 ordinary shares in the Company with a fair value of $524.2 million 272.4 million, approximately 90.4 million share options issued to existing Artisan employees with fair value of $151.9 million 79.0 million and related direct acquisition fees of $15.4 million 8.0 million including legal, valuation and accounting fees.
The shares issued on acquisition were valued in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No.
"99-12 ""EITF 99-12"", ""Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination""."
In accordance with EITF 99-12, the Company established the first date on which the number of the Company shares and the amount of other consideration became fixed as of 23 August 2004.
Accordingly, the Company valued the transaction using the average closing price of the Company's ordinary shares two days before and after 23 August 2004, or $1.616 per share.
The assumed options to acquire ordinary shares were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with volatility of between 80% and 94%, an average risk free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and dividend yield of 0.7%.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 83 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 6 Acquisitions continued The following table sets out the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition: Fair value 000 Assets: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 82,567 Accounts receivable, net 15,078 Prepaid expenses and other assets 3,225 Deferred tax asset 15,446 Property and equipment, net 2,509 Total assets acquired 118,825 Liabilities: Accounts payable and other creditors 3,674 Accrued and other liabilities 13,245 Deferred revenue 6,545 Total liabilities assumed 23,464 Net assets acquired 95,361 The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Artisan and those intangible assets of Artisan that could be clearly identified.
These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Artisan concerning development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability.
There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Artisan clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below.
The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: Useful estimated life years 000 Fair value of net assets acquired 95,361 Intangible assets acquired: Developed technology 4 5 18,177 Patents core technology 5 7 11,719 Existing agreements and customer relationships 3 8 36,354 Trademarks tradenames 4 5 2,500 Order backlog 0 1 1,354 In-process research and development written-off on acquisition 3,229 Deferred stock-based compensation 9,579 Deferred tax liability 28,042 Goodwill 331,432 Purchase price 481,663 Developed technology Developed technology of 18.2 million and patents and core technology of 11.7 million included intellectual property components for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input output components, and analog and mixed-signal products.
In addition, developed technology included a combination of processes, patents, patent applications, core modular architecture and trade secrets that are the buildings blocks of the technology.
At the date of acquisition, the developed technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the developed technology and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a discount rate of 14% for existing technology and 16% for patents and core technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows.
All developed technologies are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of 36.4 million and order backlog of 1.4 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements.
To estimate the fair value of the customer base and order backlog, a cost approach replacement value was used.
The customer base and order backlog are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks and tradenames The fair value assigned to trademarks and tradenames, including the company name Artisan, was estimated using the income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a discount rate of 16%.
84 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 6 Acquisitions continued In-process research and development Development projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as developed technology and the value assigned to developed technology was capitalized.
Expensed in-process research and development of 3.2 million reflected certain research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability or had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition.
The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated based on the percentage of completion of each project using the income approach, which discounts to present value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a discount rate of 19%.
In-process research and development has been written-off immediately to the income statement.
Goodwill of 331.4 million represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.
As stated, the acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry's broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base and it better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases.
These, combined with the ability to hire the entire Artisan work force, were significant contributing factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill.
In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company is not amortizing goodwill relating to the acquisition.
It is being carried at cost and the Company will test it for impairment annually and whenever events indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
The unaudited pro forma results of the Company for the current year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2004, and for the prior year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2003, would have been: 2003 2004 Unaudited Unaudited 000 000 Revenues 173,277 197,852 Income from operations 3,730 15,973 Net income 1,650 16,365 Diluted earnings per ordinary share 0.1p 1.2p Net income has been reduced in these pro forma results in relation to reduced interest income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, amortization of intangibles acquired and amortization of deferred compensation.

In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years.
The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over four to five years, developed technology the main IP of the company existent at acquisition and generating revenue over four to five years, existing agreements and customer relationships over two to six years, core technology over five years, trademarks over four years and order backlog over one year, being the periods over which the Company is expected to derive benefit from them.

86 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 11 Shareholders equity Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation as are those options assumed on the acquisition of Artisan.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to directors and employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
The Company also operates the US ISO Sheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
There are two further schemes for our French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM, Inc. where the period is two years.
The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM, Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The Company set up further savings-related option schemes in each year up to and including 2004 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.

Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party.
Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability.
The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee infringes such third party's intellectual property rights.
The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: i information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements: and ii the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Any such provision is based upon the directors estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
88 ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 12 Commitments and contingencies continued The total provision for such guarantees was 0.5 million on 31 December 2004, and a table showing the movement of the provision during the year is as follows: Provided in Utilized in At 1 January the year on Released the year through At 31 December 2004 new claims in the year cash payments 2004 000 000 000 000 000 Indemnification provision 1,700 1,130 780 1,530 520 The fair value of the guarantees approximates to book value due to the expected short-term nature of the provision.
At 31 December 2004, ARM had provided in aggregate 1.3 million 2003: 2.5 million in relation to the above legal matters, being the expected future costs to be incurred.
In addition, the Company had provided 6.4 million at 31 December 2003 2004: nil in relation to the Herodion settlement.
At 31 December 2004, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments of 1,179,000 2003: 1,365,000.
13 Geographic and segment information The directors are of the opinion that the Company had only one class of business during 2004.
Following the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. the directors are considering whether the business is going to be re-organised, how it will be monitored internally and whether different reportable segments will be formed.
Because the acquisition of Artisan was completed so close to the year end, the Companys consolidated income statement does not include any material trading results in respect of Artisan the Physical IP group in 2004.
The following analysis is of revenues by geographic segment and origin and long-lived assets excluding intangible assets and long-term deferred taxes by companies in each territory: Year ended 31 December 2002 2003 2004 000 000 000 Revenues by market destination : Europe 26,731 23,118 23,837 US 67,086 65,402 77,457 Japan 38,295 24,135 32,754 Asia Pacific excluding Japan 18,810 15,415 18,849 Total revenues 150,922 128,070 152,897 The Companys exports from the UK were 135,713,000, 115,072,000 and 138,078,000 for the years ended 31 December 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2004 89 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 14 Fair values of financial instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value: Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.
Marketable securities The carrying amount approximates fair value because these instruments are marked-to-market.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end.
The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are as follows: At 31 December 2003 2004 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 130,722 130,722 110,561 110,561 Short-term investments 29,064 29,064 5,307 5,307 Marketable securities 26,949 26,949 Accounts receivable 17,320 17,320 34,347 34,347 Foreign currency contracts 2,015 2,015 1,674 1,674 Embedded derivatives 2,091 2,091 2,823 2,823 15 Post balance sheet events At the 2005 Annual General Meeting of the Company on 25 April 2005, a final dividend of 0.42 pence per share total cost 5,673,000 will be proposed in respect of the 2004 financial year, and if approved will be paid on 6 May 2005 to shareholders on the register at 1 April 2005.
