Remuneration Report Pensions Pensions and life assurance benefits for UK executive directors are provided through the companys final salary occupational pension scheme for UK employees the Johnson Matthey Employees Pension Scheme JMEPS which is constituted under a separate Trust Deed.
JMEPS is an exempt approved scheme under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and its members are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and the State Second Pension.
With the agreement of the scheme actuary, the company paid contributions to JMEPS of 10% of basic salaries during the year.
In previous years accounts, disclosure of directors pension benefits has been made under the requirement of the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.
These rules are still in place, but it is now also necessary to make disclosures in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The information below sets out the disclosures under the two sets of requirements.

In accordance with the JMEPS rules, Mr Clark ceased contributing to the scheme on attaining his normal retirement date at age 60.
2 The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation from 31st March 2003.
3 The entitlement shown under Total accrued pension at 31st March 2004 is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to 31st March 2004.
The pension would, however, be subject to an actuarial reduction of 0.3% per month for each month that retirement precedes age 60.
4 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note 11, less directors contributions.
No allowance has been made in the transfer values for any discretionary benefits that have been or may be awarded under JMEPS.
The transfer values in the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 have been calculated at the start and the end of the year and, therefore, take into account market movements.
5 The JMEPS benefits and contributions for Messrs Morgan and Sheldrick are restricted by reference to the earnings cap imposed by the Finance Act No.
Contributions have therefore been paid to Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS established by the company, independently of JMEPS, with effect from 1st April 2000.
The purpose of each FURBS is to provide retirement and death benefits in relation to basic salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Because FURBS are not exempt approved under Chapter I of Part XIV of the Income & Corporation Taxes Act 1988, payments have been made to meet the tax liabilities in respect of these contributions.
6 Dr Hawker and Mr Pentz were appointed to the board with effect from 1st August 2003.
Pensions shown are the amounts accrued since appointment.
The contributions are those that have been paid since appointment.
7 Mr Pentz is a US citizen and is not a member of the UK pension scheme.
Instead, he is a member of the US salaried pension plan, which is a non-contributory defined benefit arrangement.
The entitlements shown in the tables are those arising out of his membership of this arrangement converted into sterling by reference to the exchange rates on 31st July 2003 and 31st March 2004.
The reduction in accrued pension is the result of exchange rate differences.
Mr Pentz is also a member of a savings plan 401k, to which the company contributed $8,000 between 1st August 2003 and 31st March 2004.
This is not included in the tables above but is included in his benefits in the table on page 34.
