STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES & INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT Statement of Directors responsibilities In respect of the preparation of the financial statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the statement of auditors responsibilities included in their report below, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and auditors in relation to the financial statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Independent auditors report To the members of International Power plc We have audited the financial statements on pages 70 to 103.
We have also audited the information in the Directors remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Companys members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors report and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Companys members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Directors remuneration report.
As described above, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards.
Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the UK by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and by our professions ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement on page 45 reflects the Companys compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Boards statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report, including the corporate governance statement and the unaudited part of the Directors remuneration report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 31 December 2004 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended: the financial statements and the part of the Directors remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Expenditure on audit-related regulatory reporting services in 2004 principally related to review of interim financial statements, US regulatory reporting requirements and transition to IFRS.
Further assurance services in 2004 related principally to due diligence assistance and corporate social responsibility reviews.
During 2004, additional fees of 1.3 million were paid to KPMG Audit Plc for assurance services provided in connection with the Groups acquisitions of the international assets of Edison Mission Energy.

The Audit Committee and the firm of external auditors have safeguards to avoid the possibility that the auditors objectivity and independence could be compromised.
These safeguards include the implementation of a policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit related services.
This policy incorporates the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules.
Where it is deemed that the work to be undertaken is of a nature that is generally considered reasonable to be completed by the auditor of the Group for sound commercial and practical reasons, the conduct of such work will be permissible provided that it has been pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
Examples of pre-approved services include the completion of regulatory audits, provision of taxation and regulatory advice, reporting to the SEC and the completion of certain financial due diligence work.
All these services are also subject to a predefined fee limit.
Any work performed in excess of this limit must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the Audit Committee.

The ESPS is divided into sections, and the International Power Group of ESPS was opened to members on 1 April 2002 and employees past service rights were transferred into the Group later that year.
The majority of employees taken on in First Hydro, as part of the acquisition of the EME portfolio, are members of another section of the ESPS, Energy Mission Energy Group.
Pension costs for 2004 have been calculated using assumptions consistent with those used for the 31 March 2003 funding valuation.
The pension cost for 2004 is 4 million, comprising 3 million regular cost and 1 million variation cost 2003: 3 million.
The principal assumptions used to calculate these pension costs are set out below: Pre-retirement investment return 6.6% pa Post-retirement investment return 5.1% pa Salary increases 4.1% pa Pension increases in deferment 2.7% pa Pension increases in payment 2.7% pa The actuarial value of assets in the International Power section of the ESPS as at 31 March 2004, the date of the latest formal actuarial valuation, was 47 million.
The accrued liabilities valued on the projected unit method using assumptions set out below, were 56 million.
The market value of assets was, therefore, 84% of accrued liabilities.
Arrangements have been made to make good the past service deficit over the average future working lifetime of the membership calculated to be approximately 12 years.
The principal assumptions used for the 31 March 2004 valuation are: Pre-retirement investment return 6.7% pa Post-retirement investment return 5.2% pa Salary increases 4.4% pa Pension increases in deferment 3.0% pa Pension increases in payment 3.0% pa The actuarial value of assets in the Edison Mission Energy section of the ESPS as at 31 March 2004, the date of the latest formal actuarial valuation, was 30 million.
The accrued liabilities valued on the projected unit credit method using assumptions set out below, were 40 million.
The market value of assets was therefore 75% of accrued liabilities.
Arrangements have been made to make good the past service deficit over the average future working lifetime of the membership calculated to be approximately 15 years.
The principal assumptions used for the 31 March 2004 valuation are: Pre-retirement investment return 6.7% pa Post-retirement investment return 5.2% pa Salary increases 4.4% pa Pension increases in deferment 2.9% pa Pension increases in payment 2.8% pa AUSTRALIA: Employees at Hazelwood and Loy Yang B participate in a standard Australian superannuation fund called Equipsuper.
This plan provides benefits primarily for employees in the electricity, gas and water industry, and was developed from the scheme sponsored by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria.
Employees at Synergen participate in the Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme.
At 31 December 2004, the total market value of assets was 100% of accrued liabilities.
The assets were 70 million and liabilities 70 million.
The pension cost for 2004 was 2 million 2003: 2 million.
The principal assumptions are set out below: Valuation date 31 December 2004 Investment return 4.5% pa Salary increases 4.0% pa Pensions increases n a In other countries employees are members of local social security schemes and in some cases defined contribution plans.
The charge for 2004 in respect of defined contribution plans was 1 million 2003: 1 million.
FRS17 In accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the schemes and the fair value of assets held.
However, as permitted by FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the financial statements continue to be reported under the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
81 INTERNATIONAL POWER ANNUAL REPORT 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 7 PENSION SCHEME FUNDING continued The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures for the UK schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004, and updated by qualified independent actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2004.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes for employees of its overseas businesses.
Full actuarial valuations of these schemes have been carried out within the last three years and results have been updated to 31 December 2004 by qualified independent actuaries.

The actual cum rights price on 20 August 2004, the last day of quotation cum rights, was 147p per share and the theoretical ex rights per price for an Ordinary Share was therefore 131p per share.
The comparative earnings per share are shown after applying the factor 131 147 to the published figures for 2003.
FRS 14 requires presentation of diluted earnings per share when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease net profit or increase net loss per share.
A net loss per share would only be increased by the exercise of out-of-the-money share options.
Since it seems inappropriate to assume that option holders would act irrationally, no adjustment has been made for out-of-the-money options and hence in 2003 diluted EPS after exceptional items equals basic EPS after exceptional items.

The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for the acquisition and the results have been consolidated since 17 December 2004.
The completed acquisition includes all the EME portfolio, as detailed in the Shareholders Circular dated 5 November 2004, except for: CBK, a 396 MW net hydro scheme in the Philippines: Tri Energy, a 175 MW net gas fired plant in Thailand and Doga, a 144 MW net gas fired plant in Turkey.

Mitsui Power Ventures Limited has a 30% minority interest in the total assets acquired net of the acquisition debt used to acquire the EME portfolio.
EME prepares its accounts under US GAAP.
The fair value adjustments for the alignment of accounting policies reflect the adoption of Group accounting policies, principally in respect of eliminating historical acquisition goodwill, eliminating historical step up adjustments to the carrying value of tangible fixed assets at acquisition, capitalisation and depreciation of outage costs, changing the asset recognition of certain power plants which sell their output under long-term PPAs from tangible fixed assets to finance lease debtors, taking derivatives for hedging off balance sheet and providing for deferred tax on timing differences rather than temporary differences.
The revaluation adjustments are made to reflect the fair value of the net assets acquired and principally represent for tangible fixed assets the recognition of plant at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and value in use, the revaluation of debt instruments to market value, the recognition of unprovided amounts in respect of onerous contracts and other liabilities.
The revaluation of investments comprises the Groups share of those revaluation adjustments outlined above applicable to the joint ventures and associates in which the Group has acquired an interest.
No goodwill arises on the acquisition.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition to the balance sheet date, the fair values attributed to the EME portfolio are provisional and may be revised.
The unaudited results of the EME portfolio, based on EMEs accounting policies under US GAAP prior to the acquisition and excluding fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition, for the year ended 31 December 2003 and from 1 January 2004 to 16 December 2004 are shown below, expressed in US dollars.

Turbogs prepares its accounts under Portuguese GAAP.
The fair value adjustments for the alignment of accounting policies reflect the adoption of Group accounting policies, principally in respect of changing the asset recognition of the power plant, which sells its output under a long-term PPA, from a tangible fixed asset to a finance lease debtor.
The revaluation adjustments are made to reflect the fair value of the net assets acquired and principally represent the revaluation of the finance lease debtor to fair value and the recognition of unprovided amounts in respect of tax liabilities.
In the year ended 31 December 2003 the unaudited profit after tax of Turbogs based on its accounting policies prior to the acquisition was 4 million.

There are no material financial liabilities on which interest is not paid.
The effect of the Group interest swaps was to classify 692 million of floating rate Australian dollar borrowings, 103 million of floating rate US dollar borrowings, 71 million of floating rate sterling borrowings, 40 million of floating rate Czech koruna borrowings and 36 million of floating rate Euro borrowings all at fixed rate in the above table.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities as, in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance for various time periods up to 12 months by reference to LIBOR for that time period.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial instruments are as follows: i For investments of up to three months, trade debtors, other debtors and prepayments, trade creditors, other current liabilities, long-term and short-term borrowings, the book value approximates to fair value because of their short maturity.
ii The fair value of investments maturing after three months has been estimated using quoted market prices.
iii The fair value of long-term borrowings and interest rate swaps has been calculated using market prices when available or the net present value of future cash flows arising.
iv The fair value of the Groups forward exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options has been calculated using the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.

30 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS a Legal proceedings against the Company The Company is aware of the following matters, which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group: i Claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the Central Electricity Generating Board CEGB and contractors in respect of industrial illness and injury.
RWE NPower has agreed to indemnify International Power on an after-tax basis to the extent of 50% of any liability that the Company may incur whether directly or indirectly as a consequence of those proceedings to the extent such liability is not insured by Electra Insurance Limited.
ii In 1994 separate complaints were made by the National Association of Licensed Opencast Operators NALOO and the South Wales Small Miners Association SWSMA to the European Commission against the Company, PowerGen plc, British Coal Corporation and HM Government.
The complaint alleges violations of EU Competition law arising out of the coal purchasing arrangements entered into by the CEGB prior to 1 April 1990 and requests the Commission to find that the CEGBs practices violated EU law.
NALOO and SWSMA allege that such a finding would be grounds for a claim for damages in the English courts by their respective members.
Appeals against the Commission findings were brought by NALOO and SWSMA.
The SWSMA appeal was initially ruled out of time, but on appeal a faction was allowed to proceed.
Progress with this claim will be influenced by the outcome of the NALOO appeal.
At first instance, the European Court ruled that the Commission is under an obligation to investigate the complaint by NALOO.
The Company, PowerGen plc, British Coal Corporation and the Commission appealed against the ruling to the European Court of Justice which delivered a judgement on 2 October 2003 for the main part dismissing the appeal.
In its judgement, the Court decided that the Commission has the power to investigate and the matter is now with the Commission for consideration.
It is not practicable to estimate legal costs or possible damages at this stage.
The Commission ruled on the complaint in 1998 and did not make any findings against the Company.
RWE NPower has agreed to indemnify International Power on an after-tax basis to the extent of 50% of any liability that the Company may incur whether directly or indirectly as a consequence of those proceedings.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, the Groups insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that the matters referred to above will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Groups financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
b Taxation The Company is aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of disputes with the tax authorities in the territories where the Group has operations.
