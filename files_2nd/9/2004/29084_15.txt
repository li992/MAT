It had 515 active members in the final salary section and 444 members in the defined contribution section at 31st December 2004 612 and 359 respectively at 31st December 2003.
The most recent triennial valuation of the UK Scheme was carried out as at 1st January 2003 and disclosed that the market value of the assets of the UK Scheme represented 88% of the liability for the benefits that had accrued to members at that date allowing for future increases in earnings and pensions.
As a result of discussions between the Trustees and Company following the valuation, the Company agreed to increase its contributions to 30.8% of capped salaries to cover the accrual of ongoing benefits.
In addition, the Company agreed to make additional contributions of 375,000 per month from January 2003 until June 2015 to extinguish the past service deficit in the UK Scheme.
These contributions will be reviewed at the next formal valuation of the UK Scheme which is due as at 1st January 2006.
The pension cost under SSAP 24 for the final salary section of the UK Scheme has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Hewittt Bacon & Woodrow, and is based on a valuation of the UK Scheme as at 1st January 2003.
This valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.
The principal financial assumptions used to calculate the pension cost were that inflation would average 2.3% per annum and that pension increases and pay increases would average 0.2% per annum and 1.5% per annum above inflation.
A discount rate of 5.5% before retirement and 4.8% after retirement was used.
Assets were taken at market value together with an adjustment that phased in over three years the UK Scheme's assets' underperformance versus a notional portfolio constructed to match the liabilities of the UK Scheme.
This SSAP 24 valuation as at 1st January 2003 showed that the market value of the assets of the final salary section was 302 million.
After allowing for the underperformance adjustment, the assets represented 106% of the liabilities.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of regular costs of the UK Scheme was 11.6 million 13.1 million less the variation of 0.9 million 1.1 million for the amortisation of the surplus over the average remaining service lives of the active employees, using the percentage of payroll method.
The net pension cost charged was 9.8 million 11.4 million which incorporated a small reduction of 0.9 million 0.6 million in respect of the balance sheet prepayment at the start of the year.
Over the year, the contributions to the final salary section of the UK Scheme totalled 14.9 million 15.8 million.
The balance sheet prepayment at 31st December 2004 was 20.7 million 15.6 million.
The Group operates a number of smaller pension schemes around the world, some of which are funded defined benefits schemes with valuations performed regularly by qualified actuaries.
The actuarial assumptions vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the funds are situated.
These schemes are accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on pension costs see Note 1 r, therefore no adjustments are required on consolidation.
In addition, there are several defined contribution schemes.
The additional disclosures required by the Financial Reporting Standard 17 'FRS 17' are set out below.

Deferred tax of 12.5 million relating to prior year losses and timing differences in the U. S. is not recognised due to uncertainty over whether sufficient profits will arise to enable this asset to be utilised, and the deferred tax charge includes a write-off of this amount.

Other provisions consist primarily of liabilities relating to surplus space, the sale of the Groups investment banking business in April 2000, and litigation.
Provisions have been made against certain leaseholds in connection with surplus space.
The provisions have been made taking into account residual lease commitments, other outgoings and sub-letting arrangements.
In arriving at the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted at rates representing an estimation of the interest rates relevant to the period of provision.
The weighted average of these rates is 4.8% 4.4%.
Provisions made in respect of surplus space are expected to be utilised over the remaining lives of the operating leases to which they relate.
These leases expire in 2015 and 2017.
Due to the nature of the remainder of the other provisions, it is not possible to quantify accurately the dates on which they are expected to be utilised.

These instruments comprised debt securities, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
Where instruments have been used for hedging purposes, the underlying assets that are being hedged relate to investments in subsidiaries and current asset investments.
Fair value disclosures relating to such amounts are not disclosed above.
Fair value disclosures relating to the underlying assets are only disclosed above if these assets were financial assets.
e Hedges As stated on page 26, the Group has a number of overseas subsidiaries whose shareholders funds, revenues and expenses are denominated principally in local currencies.
Financial instruments are used within the Group where it is considered that the sterling values of such amounts are at risk.
In such cases, forward currency contracts with fair value at the balance sheet date of 2.4 million 1.3 million were being used to hedge foreign currency assets.
In relation to the Groups hedging of its seed and liquid capital investments, at 31st December 2004, the Group had futures contracts with fair value of 0.3 million 0.5 million hedging investments against market movements and forward currency contracts with a fair value of 9.0 million 12.1 million hedging investments against currency movements.
The use of forward currency contracts is due principally to the investment of liquid capital in U. S. fixed income securities hedged to sterling.
The Group has a policy of hedging certain exposures as and when they arise.
Gains and losses made on hedges are recognised by marking to market, except for certain Private Banking transactions which are not deemed to be material.

Holders of the subscriber shares have no right to participate in the profits or assets of the Company and are not entitled to vote at general meetings of the Company, although they are entitled to receive notice of and attend such meetings.
Changes in authorised, allotted and issued share capital During the year, 628,488 non-voting ordinary shares were issued as part of the deferred compensation arising from the acquisition of Beaumont Capital Management Limited in 2001, and 138,465 issued pursuant to the exercise of options under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1986: as a result 0.8 million was credited to share capital and 4.7 million to the share premium account.
In addition, the Group purchased a total of 90,535 of its own non-voting ordinary shares during the year which were then cancelled.
As a result, 0.1 million was debited to share capital and credited to a capital redemption reserve.
