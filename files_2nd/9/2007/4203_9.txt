Acquisition of Uniqema On 1 September 2006, the Group completed the purchase of the Uniqema business from ICI plc and the Groups 2006 financial statements included provisional information on the fair values of assets acquired and consideration.
By 31August 2007, the Group had completed its review of the acquired asset base and had finalised the fair values of all acquired assets and liabilities.
Additionally during 2007, the final adjustments were agreed with respect to purchase consideration.
The table below shows the carrying value of Uniqemas net assets immediately prior to acquisition along with the final fair values and consideration.

As disclosed last year, after a rigorous review in the twelve months after acquisition, there were found to be no material separately identifiable and quantifiable intangible assets, other than computer software.
Consequently, the whole excess of consideration over net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
The goodwill is supported principally by the cost saving synergies arising as a result of bringing Uniqema within Crodas existing structure.
Other factors supporting the goodwill include i the acquisition of a skilled workforce: ii the fact that Uniqemas product portfolio complements Crodas existing product offering: and iii further expected growth as a result of rationalising and improving Uniqemas existing distribution network through utilisation of Crodas outstanding sales and marketing network.
