The Companys principal accounting policies adopted in the presentation of these financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
Cash flow statement and related party disclosures The results, assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the consolidated financial statements of Hays plc, which are publicly available.
Consequently, the Company has taken exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 revised Cash Flow Statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the Group.
ii Investments Shares in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
iii Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which result in an obligation at the Balance Sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
iv Pension costs For defined benefit schemes, the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
They are included as part of staff costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each Balance Sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the Balance Sheet.

The age profile of the active membership will rise over time and hence the future service cost is also likely to rise.

In the context of the prudent funding structure of the Group, the Group is in a strong position to manage this long term liability to the satisfaction and benefit of all stakeholders.
