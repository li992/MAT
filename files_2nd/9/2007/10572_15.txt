As discussed below under capital management, the Group does not have any derivative or non-derivative financial liabilities with the exception of finance lease liabilities, trade and other payables, current tax liabilities and retirement benefit obligations.
Current tax liabilities and trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and therefore have no weighted average effective interest rates.
Retirement benefit obligations are measured at the net of the present value of retirement benefit obligations and the fair value of the Plan assets.
Finance lease liabilities are carried at the present value of the minimum lease payments with the future value of finance charges.
An analysis of the maturity profile for finance lease liabilities is contained in note 16.
