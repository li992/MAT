indd 143 13 03 2012 01:37 144 Financial report Schroders plc Notes to the accounts 37 Financial instrument risk management The Companys policy is to have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, it should have sufficient capital to maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Any surplus capital is loaned back to the Groups investment capital management entities.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
Details of the Groups risk management processes are outlined in Risk management and internal controls within the Governance section of the Annual Report and Accounts.
TheCompanys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys counterparties are predominantly its subsidiaries and therefore there is minimal external credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The Groups liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency.
The Company holds sufficient liquid funds to cover its liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company can request to borrow investment capital through intragroup loans and the Group loan facility see below to maintain sufficient liquidity.
The Group has investment capital which includes investments in fixed income and money market portfolios.
Liquidity in these portfolios is monitored by the Group on a regular basis.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 250 million, which was undrawn by the Company at the year-end date 2010: 10 million drawn.
The facility expires on 23 September 2013.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
At 31 December 2011, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher nil lower 2010: 200 basis points higher nil lower with all other variables held constant, the Company estimates that post-tax profit for the year would have increased decreased by 3 million nil 2010: increased decreased by 4 million nil respectively, mainly as a result of higher lower interest income on the Companys interest-bearing intercompany receivables and payables, bank borrowings and cash: other components of equity would have been unaffected.
The model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits has been based on the assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Foreign exchange and pricing risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Company is not directly exposed to foreign exchange or pricing risk.
The investment in subsidiary is in Sterling and is held at historic cost.
It has indirect exposure to foreign exchange and pricing risk in the Group which could result in the impairment of this subsidiary.
There are currently sufficient resources in subsidiaries to absorb any normal market events.
