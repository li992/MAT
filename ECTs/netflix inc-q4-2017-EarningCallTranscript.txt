Spencer Wang -- Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development
Good afternoon, and welcome to Netflix Q4 2017 Earnings interview. I'm Spencer Wang, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Joining me today, our CEO Reed Hastings, CFO David Wells, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Todd Juenger from Bernstein. Before we begin though, please remember that we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. With that, let me turn it over to Todd for his first question.
Motley Fool¡¯s 5G Stock Pick
For the first time ever, Apple will release an iPhone that is 5G ready and 5G will supercharge this new iPhone.
That¡¯s why Apple analysts are convinced that an unprecedented number of Apple fans will sprint to upgrade to this new iPhone.
But before you run out and buy shares of Apple, there¡¯s something you need to know, because there might be an even more lucrative way to play the coming iPhone boom.
Legendary Canadian stock analyst Iain Butler and his team at Stock Advisor Canada have identified a tiny American company (52 times smaller than Apple¡¯s) that seems perfectly positioned for the coming iPhone supercycle.
That¡¯s why so many investors are buzzing with excitement about the new report from Iain Butler¡¯s team at Stock Advisor Canada. The name of this report is ¡°iPhone Super-Cycle: An Investor¡¯s Guide to the Coming Apple Tsunami.¡±
This new report reveals the reasons why we think every forward-thinking investor should be paying close attention to this revolutionary new industry.

Questions and Answers:
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
Thanks, Spencer. Just to get things rolling before we get into the details and one thing that makes this quarter different than other quarters is technically we're putting a close on one year and entering another. So, I thought it might be a useful time more than usual to check in with each of you, actually, in order-maybe Greg, and Ted, and Reed and just if you could share the couple biggest things you learned in 2017 and how that's informing your key priorities going forward into the new year, 2018. I think that would be a great way to get started.
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
Greg, I think you're up first.
Greg Peters -- Chief Product Officer
Sure. I think looking back at the last year I'm just tremendously excited at seeing the range of opportunities that are in front of us and that the technology that we're investing in can continue to provide incremental benefits in experience, which we see through our AB testing. So, most excited that we have just so much more runway in front of us.
Ted Sarandos -- Chief Content Officer
And I'd say we've had a kind of good reinforcement of the value of experimentation, getting out from just the core of television and film into things more like unscripted and other projects that are proving that we can do things well across a broad variety of different things as long as we keep doing what we started doing, which is hire great people, give them the resources to make great content and get out of their way.
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
And Todd, for me, it's much more continuous, you know, coming up on 20 years here than it is broken up in annual chunks, but certainly, our expansion around the world is phenomenal. We're continuing to invest in shows around the world. Dark was a big highlight. We'll have more of those from around the world in Q1, and so we're learning better and better about how to be an effective, global company both for consumers, for governments, and for content producers.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
Terrific. Thanks. I just realized I left David out of the order there, but don't worry. I'll give you plenty of questions similar to that along the way David. Speaking of growth around the world, but the biggest metric investors often look for first in your results is subscriber growth. Clearly, subscriber net additions came in well ahead of your own forecast for the quarter. I guess an obvious question is sort of why and where? You addressed that a little bit in your letter saying it was broad-based. I think you cited original content slate and the growth of internet TV, but I got ask-a chance just for anybody who wants to expand on that a little bit-how you did so much better coming out of the quarter than you even thought you would going into the quarter.
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
Ted, you want to take that about the role of the big titles?
Ted Sarandos -- Chief Content Officer
Well, the great thing is the big players in Q1 and the film Bright and certainly Stranger Things, Season 2, not only landed really well with viewers and consumers but also were perfectly global, meaning that the watching was distributed almost exactly like our member base is. So, a good story told well is a global product.
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
And other key things in Q4 were as you pointed out just the continued growth of internet TV, and we see that because Hulu's also growing. YouTube is also growing, and so it's great that we're keeping up with this big internet-driven transformation and that we're pleasing our members with this extraordinary 8 million net-add quarter.
David Wells -- Chief Financial Officer
And Todd, just to annotate Ted and Reed, one thing is we were a little conservative going into Q4 with price changes, and so it reflects a little bit of tempering of our expectations going through there. But given the broad scale strength of the content offering and then the global strength, you put those two things together, and you end up with the quarter that we had in Q4, which was great.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
I definitely want to talk a little bit about the pricing here in a minute, but before we move onto that, you talked about broad-based, basically, global growth. Can I ask specifically about a couple geographies? I understand broad-based means them all, but Asia has been one particular gigantic region I know of particular focus for your company. Anything you'd want to put out specifically in Asia in the quarter or more broadly over the course of a couple quarters that are going well or not well that we should know about?
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, Todd, we're not gonna do regional breakouts. I won't give you specifics on it, but we definitely are seeing success as you all know and your channel checks and other things tell in the different markets. And when we compare it to Latin America several years ago, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making through India, through South East Asia, and Japan. So, really all across the board we're seeing growth penetrations that look like the first couple years of Latin America, which has as you know worked out very well for the company.
David Wells -- Chief Financial Officer
That's worth pointing out, Todd, that we're now lapping two years in our global launch. So, for many of these markets, we launched with a global product, not localized, not tailored to the specific market. We've added some languages along the way. We're adding content along the way, but for many of these markets they still reflect some relative youth in terms of how long we've been in the market, relative to say Latin America where we're five and six years in and Europe where we're four years in some of the larger markets and a little bit younger in the smaller markets in Europe.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
Make sense. One of the things that you did not cite in the investor letter at least in turns of sub growth-at least in the paragraph about sub growth-was some of the plans you have with partners, MVPD partners and ISP partners. You did talk about that in a different section, but you didn't cite it referring to the sub growth. Can you talk a little bit about what contribution those partnerships made to sub growth in the quarter, even help us box sort of what percentage, if you will, of sort of net adds are on those sorts of relationships or total members are on those such relationships? Help us understand what a proportion to your subscriber base in growth those type of deals are.
David Wells -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, Netflix continues to be a sort of multi-impression sale, and so if somebody joins us through a partner, it isn't necessarily because that partner did a specific promotion but it might be just most convenient collection mechanism for that. that said, The importance of partnerships has grown as we get embedded in more ISPs, in more CE devices, in more consumer electronics and things like that. So, I'll pitch it to Greg at this point, but I would say, Todd, it continues to be a meaningful contributor but not a dominant contributor in terms of being a major channel for us in terms of acquisition. Again, relative to what I said about Netflix being a multi-impression sale. And then, Greg, if you want to...
Greg Peters -- Chief Product Officer
Yeah, just briefly, I think that's right. It's all the sort of stops along the way and the customer journey, and one of the things that's working for us well is to shave off friction at each of those different points, whether it's payments or access for engagement, how you sign up. And so, while those partners aren't the dominant source of acquisition for us, they still remain important, and we'll continue to invest in them globally.
Spencer Wang -- Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development
The only other thing to add there, Todd, is as you know most of the MVPDs and ISPs are regional. So, any one single partnership isn't particularly material to our global net additions.
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
Greg, when you think about the next couple years, where essentially all smart TVs have Netflix, how do you think about the potential in the MVPD space? Kind of roughly what percentage on a global basis are we? What might we become over five or ten years?
Greg Peters -- Chief Product Officer
Yeah, and we think essentially an MVPD or the operator set up box integrations that we are doing. We're way younger than we are in TV for example. But unlike TV, these operator integrations have a whole bunch of consumer benefits that we haven't really been able to realize in the TV space when you think about payment integration. Also, it's a different demographic. Typically, smart TV purchasers are more toward the front end of the technology adoption curve, and being on a sent-out box from an operator allows us to be in the place where a lot of folks are consuming linear TV, more traditional, and catching a little bit more of the later adopter and then making it super easy for them to sign up by just actually adding Netflix to their bill or even more what we're looking at now is packaging Netflix into one of those operator offerings so they just get it as part of a bundle that they're purchasing for the operator. So, I think we'll see that grow in importance, but, again, we're a couple years behind where we are in smart TVs today.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
Got it. One final one, and those, if you don't mind, probably for David, just how should we think about the unit economics of one of those subscribers for Netflix, especially, I guess, comes to mind in terms of subscriber acquisition cost-getting a subscriber on your own versus through a partner-but then also any sort of churn or engagement differences that you've been yet to be able to observe about the lifetime value of those two different types of costumers?
David Wells -- Chief Financial Officer
So, the headline would be consistent. There's nothing different about those sort of new cohorts and new partnerships that we're joining that is different than the ones we've had before. But there is a churn benefit, especially if you're thinking about Netflix being bundled in with a consistently lower churn product, that has a positive benefit to the lifetime value of that subscriber.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
And I had one final one, specifically on subs before we get probably onto pricing. What do you think about the US, specifically? I guess the question would be who is left? Who is not subscribing to Netflix? Who are these new subscribers that you continue to add? Where are they coming from? One might think maybe they're among a slightly older demographic. I don't know if that's a myth or where there's some truth to that. But if there's some truth to that, how are you attracting these subscribers or these members who are just now deciding to sign up for Netflix? Who are they, and how true of confidence you can keep hitting those elusive groups that have eluded you so far?
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you recall, Todd, it was five years ago when we said we thought the market in the US would be somewhere between 60 and 90 million. We're still only at 55, so we got a ways to go just to cross into the bottom of our expectation range. And then we continue, as Greg said, to make it easier to access, and then the real driver is to make the big titles bigger. So, what happens is so many people are talking about Bright, or Stranger Things 2, or The Crown that that's what pulls in people who haven't yet joined is all their friends are talking about the shows. That's the dominant accelerator.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
Fair enough.
Ted Sarandos -- Chief Content Officer
And I think you're addressing, like Grace & Frankie, which launched its new season this week, which clearly reaches an older demographic, but it keeps getting broader and bigger every year meaning that even though it was intended for a specific, older demographic, young people love it as well. They're discovering it through word of mouth from a lot of new sources. So, I think back when we talked about that market size back then, that's a very fluid market in terms of what demographics of people are watching content on the internet.
Todd Juenger -- AB Bernstein -- Interviewer
Got it. Got to talk about pricing a bit, right? So, another big thing that happened in the quarter was a significant-on a percentage basis-pricing increase across most of your plans across most of the world. You, I think, made a remark earlier that that drove some of your cautiousness in your subscriber guide. It doesn't seem to have affected subscribers in the way that was implied in your guidance. So, fair to say, any impact at all that we should think about maybe on churn or as a barrier to new adds and then anything different on the mix of the popularity of different plans now there's a bigger spread between the prices around the world? There's a lot in that question, but I guess I'm trying to figure out what we can take away from the experience with the price increase.
Reed Hastings -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let's see. We moved from roughly
